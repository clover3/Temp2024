Did you know the feds dropped this case after several plaintiffs agreed to participate in the prosecution?\n\nThe $100k of Facebook ads is the least of it. If you read the Mueller Report Sections II and III you'll also see that they hacked the Clinton campaign's computers and emails, had hundreds of fake Facebook accounts, thousands of fake Twitter accounts, tens of thousands of followers, posts reaching millions of people, and even organized political rallies starting with a \"confederate rally\" in Nov 2015. You are correct that some of the accounts pretended to be in support of left-wing causes; the goal was to weaken the USA by sowing discord internally, and they saw electing Trump as key to that goal along with stirring anger on a variety of issues.\n\n>And the evidence is?\n\nThe evidence of the communication is everything documented in the approx 100 pages of the Mueller Report Section IV. I can't copy and paste the entire section, but here's an example:  \n\"Approximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed lvanka Trump on behalf of Erchova's then-husband Dmitry Klokov, to offer Klokov's assistance to the Trump Campaign. Klokov was at that time Director of External Communications for PJSC Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, a large Russian electricity transmission company, and had been previously employed as an aide and press secretary to Russia's energy minister.\"\n\n  \n  \nRegarding the rest of your post - maybe you're right and every single seemingly suspicious contact between Trump campaign members and Russian government officials can be explained away. But regardless, the presence of that communication, lying about it, and desire of the Russian government to see Trump elected is suspicious to everyone, and investigating that potential criminality is not a hoax. \n\n\n\nI notice you didn't respond to my question on my prior post, I'm still curious about the answer so here it is again:\n\nEven if you did believe that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government, would that change your support of Trump?", "label": 0}

Claiming a faith then supporting things that are so clearly against the faith doesn't quite make sense if you believe in that faith. Biden made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion rally. What is Christian about that? \n\nDon't associate those people with Christianity as if they're in any way worthy of that title. \n\nb) Yes, I'm voting for the party generally and not him. I think he has divided the party into more conservative and more liberal factions. I also think he's fractured the party by being a figurehead of the America First movement. We have a new generation of conservative leaders who are now defining themselves against the Neoconservatives and that's causing a lot of friction. I don't think all of that can personally be ascribed to Trump as if he's some amazing thought leader, but he's certainly been a key figure in why it's an issue right now within us. \n\nTo the religion point, at least the major religions all believe they're correct. Even if we disagree, we understand someone standing strong on their faith and saying theirs is correct. Muslims and Christians have had numerous debates on who is and isn't correct, so it's not a hostile statement. The founding fathers didn't make us a secular nation. They explicitly put God in our founding texts. The freedom of religion didn't come from them being supportive or neutral towards atheists. The freedom of religion didn't mean they were like the \"whatever is fine\" libertarians of today. \n\nHaving a Christian nation doesn't equal a theocracy. For me, that'd just mean that we apply more Christian morality in our culture and law. What does that mean? Take abortion for example: in a Christian nation abortion would be banned outright. Why? Because those children have a right to live, no matter the circumstances of their conception. This is based on the belief that Christians have where humans are made in the image of God and it's not up to us to decide whether they are killed or not. In a theocracy, we'd cite the Bible in the law that bans abortion. In a Christian nation that isn't a theocracy, we'd see abortion as unthinkable based on our beliefs and we'd ban it. Do you see how those two are different? \n\nSo far as some people seeing Trump as anointed by God, I don't personally agree. I don't really care if I'm honest. \n\nFar as the country not becoming a theocracy, I think encouraging people to keep society in check rather than fight over the political hand would do better for us. Not that we shouldn't run for office and do what we can there, but the job is much easier when the people are on your side.", "label": 0}

The ceiling was not too low for Marines to fly in combat, but flying POTUS was obviously something very different. If a motorcade was necessary, it could take between ninety and a hundred and twenty minutes each way, along roads that were not exactly freeways, posing an unacceptable risk that we could not get the President out of France quickly enough in case of an emergency.

Once again, as far as Christian nationalism, they wouldn't have considered Christianity as on par with Islam. They wouldn't have said that secular society is on par with or preferable to a religious society. The idea that they made the country secular makes no sense if you just think about the time and place our founding fathers were born in. \n\nI'm aware of the story you're talking about. I do not believe that's correct, but I can't pull out quotes for it right now. So far as why we oppose abortion, we believe that every child is uniquely made in the image of God. We also believe that children are gifts and blessings from God. We aren't to kill them based on that reason.\n\nThat isn't a theocracy, it's having a moral compass and voting with it in mind. Religion informs your morals and the way you think so of course it'll impact voting. It'll impact certain policies you may propose or object to. For other Americans, they'd be doing the same thing that I am. Nobody proposes or supports laws that don't align with their beliefs or morals in some way unless they're just falling in line with people they disagree with.", "label": 0}

Why would you vote for someone who lies like this and has such a toxic worldview that White men are inundated with hate in every form of media they consume ?\n\nIf you like liars, and you claim trump is a liar why wouldn't you vote for him ?\n\nHe's in the party that is the closest thing to \"representation\" White men have and he said in the debate that the thing he's proudest of is lowering black and Hispanic unemployment and giving money to historically black colleges.\n\nHis campaign director Susan Wiles said the trump strategy going forward is to \"replace Karen and Chad with Miguel and Jamal\"\n\nThere isnt a single, White Germanic/anglo-teutonic, protestant in the Biden  admin holding even a single top level bureau chief post.\n\nMore then 50% of his appointments have been jewish\n\nJewish Americans are a plurality in all 8 ivy league schools\n\n7 of 8 president's of ivy league schools are jewish. 0 are White protestants \n\nColumbia university is 27% \"White\".

Kamala Harris called out the rhetoric in her ad. But % representation shows that not just rhetoric, but discriminatory actions may be involved as well. Kinda looks like a concerted attempt to water down and eliminate White protestants, formerly the over whelming majority in this country, replaced without their consent.\n\nSo we've been disenfranchised, replaced without our consent, locked out of access to power or any representation in government, locked out of top tier academics, and rhetorically attacked every time we consume any media (per Kamala Harris, unless of course you're calling her a liar which if you are id like to know why, and if you're planning to vote for a liar \"with a toxic world view\") and you're not sure why my world view is\" toxic ?\"", "label": 0}

The liberals will call it a worldwide cult but the reality is that Trump is more entertaining than any other politician anywhere and therefore he has fans.

It seems like thing after thing come up in the list of concerns or problems with Trump being a president and there is always an excuse as to why it shouldn\u2019t be believed. Things that, if they happened with anyone else, people would have sent them packing years ago. Most of the people who have spoken out against Trump were very well-respected people before they spoke out against him, but once they did, suddenly there were reasons they were bad people and not to be trusted. And not just one of two people, but many. This is not a usual occurrence.

Incest also probably yes unless the baby would have significant health issues that would lead it to die anyways.\n\n>Why isn\u2019t refusing to aid in herd immunity or resistance counted as participation in hands off murder?\n\nBecause herd immunity can be achieved without them, and if there is a higher risk of adverse effects, or even not *knowing* if there are any adverse effects, it's much more reasonable to avoid the vaccine. For example, I'd be way more annoyed about avoiding something like a standard measles or flu vaccine that we know has no issues vs a government mandated, rushed vaccine for a brand new widespread illness that we know very little about.\n\nRegardless, you can't just claim murder for a lack of participation in something. That's like saying \"If you don't donate money to starving children in Africa you're essentially murdering them\".\n\n>Why is it okay for you to endanger others lives, but then claim you champion the saving of lives?\n\nMe getting the vaccine or not does not endanger the lives of others. If they get the vaccine they're not in danger. If they don't, and I don't, we both accepted the risk. And I never claimed to be any champion of saving lives.", "label": 0}

However, many have been authoritarian given the nature of the power provided to a president by the constitution. But none have hit all the characteristics of a fascist as trump as provided by evidence below. what is the evidence that any modern president has expressed All the fascist characteristics as outlined below as trump has?\n\n\\[Recently, prominent military figures like Generals John Kelly and Mark Milley, who worked closely with Donald Trump as his Chief of Staff and Joint Chief, have labeled him a fascist. In doing so, they have joined many WWII historians and experts on fascism who have said the same thing. (Even Trump\u2019s own VP once called him America\u2019s Hitler.) This, of course, has many wondering exactly what fascism is. (After all, John Kelley basically had to read the Wikipedia definition to know for sure how to define it.)\n\nFortunately, there is no shortage of academic work on the topic, and correspondingly no shortage of bullet point lists of what fascism\u2019s essential elements are. There is Chris Hedges\u2019 (2006) book\u00a0*American Fascists*\u00a0which differentiates between historical (1920\u201330s Italian and German) fascism, and what he calls \u201cEternal Fascism\u201d (the political ideology and approach of historical fascism that can be repeated by other movements) which has fourteen characteristics. Dunwoody (et al., 2022) lays out four components, and in\u00a0*How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us Versus Them*, philosopher Jason Stanley (2018) defines fascism primarily by how it approaches politics and argues that it generally employs ten tactics. Georgetown University history professor John McNeill (2016) says fascism has eleven components.\n\nSuch lists usually have some unique elements, but also have a lot of overlap; if we were to paraphrase and combine them, we would get something like the following list. As you will see, Trump basically matches all but one \u2014 and it only take matching up to a few to make a person fascist \u2014 thus confirming Kelly and Milley\u2019s evaluation.\n\n**1) Inaccurate Nostalgia:**\u00a0Fascism mythologizes the greatness of the past and promises a return to the days of traditional racial and gender hierarchies that favored the in-group. (Hitler did this in his promises to oust the Jews and rebuild the German empire that fell after WWI.)\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan encapsulates this perfectly, as he wants to return America to a (mythical) era of bygone greatness. And his rhetoric makes it clear what aspects of the past he wants to return to: those that established racial and gender hierarchies, which disadvantaged minorities and women, and allowed men to dominate both economically and politically.\n\n**2) Authoritarian/Hero Worship/Leader Cult:**\u00a0Fascism\u00a0embraces a cult like worship of a single leader, who is the final arbiter of what is good and evil, and thus can do no wrong. Followers of the leader see themselves as heroes as well, called to defend (and even die) for the leader\u2019s cause, and think that everyone should submit to the leader\u2019s authority. Hitler unquestionably inspired this kind of devotion, as does Kim Jung Il in North Korea.\n\nCult Followers are Willing To Die for thier Leader\n\nTrump\u2019s base demonstrates this exact kind of devotion. From \u201cJesus is my savior, and Trump is my president\u201d to cheering for his defiance of laws and democratic norms, to thinking that he is the only person who tells the truth, his followers view him as a hero and believe they must defend him against all opposition. The crimes people were willing to commit storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021 are a prime example of this kind of devotion. Indeed, many republican politicians are scared to contradict him because of the cult like following he has.\n\n**3) Theatricality:**\u00a0Party leaders are verbose, with lots of big gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. Rallies become rituals for loyalists, with lots of slogans, catch phrases, and party paraphernalia. Military parades, and parades of the faithful, are common. (Both Mussolini and Hitler had verbose presentation styles; North Korea under the Kim\u2019s has lots of parades of the military and the faithful.)\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies are the epitome of theatricality, filled with chants like \u201cLock her up!\u201d, \u201cBuild the Wall,\u201d and campaign signs calling for \u201cMass deportation.\u201d His speeches are filled with dramatic gestures and language, and his larger-than-life persona, combined with MAGA hats, slogans, and paraphernalia, creates a ritualistic atmosphere. They are \u201cpilgrimages\u201d for true believers.\n\ncontinued\u2026\n\nwhat is the evidence that any modern president has expressed All the fascist characteristics as outlined below as trump has?", "label": 0}

{"text": "**Part 2**\n\n**4) Deceptive Propaganda/Newspeak:**\u00a0Fascist propaganda undermines independent reporting and then creates its own that is not only un-factual, but uses universally accepted ideals such as freedom, free speech, and public safety as a way to gain power, and even undermine those very ideals. One major way of doing this is with a double standard: claiming that criticisms of the fascists are \u201ccensorship\u201d (when in fact no effort to keep them from saying what they said are made), and then calling for the censorship of those who criticize them (thus making an effort to keep their opponents from saying what they say).\n\nThe term \u201cNewspeak\u201d comes from Orwell\u2019s book\u00a0*1984*, and is a practice (related to semantic infiltration) that seeks to simplify language in a way that curtails critical thought, obscures bad things as good, and associates everything with the party as good (and everything against the party as bad.). Example: In\u00a0*1984*\u00a0Newspeak, \u201cfree\u201d only means \u201cthe absence of\u201d\u2026as in \u201cThe dog is free of lice.\u201d There is no word for \u201cfreedom of action/thought\u201d and thus it can occur to no one that they lack it.[\\[1\\]](https://medium.com/@kylejohnson_40581/the-20-signs-that-trump-is-a-fascist-6eb84922defb#_ftn1)\u00a0Mao did this in China. The world for \u201cblood relative\u201d was eliminated and replaced with a word that equated all members of the party as being brothers/sisters.[\\[2\\]](https://medium.com/@kylejohnson_40581/the-20-signs-that-trump-is-a-fascist-6eb84922defb#_ftn2)\n\nTrump calls the press \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d and labels all news stories and organizations he doesn\u2019t like \u201cfake news.\u201d (In true Newspeak style, he changed the meaning of that phrase, so that it no longer referred to the false news stories which he was repeating, and instead referred to news he didn\u2019t like.) He repeatedly twists the truth and lies to suit his agenda \u2014 saying, for example, that he never told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d when audio of the phone call clearly proves otherwise. His administration frequently undermined freedoms, such as free speech and freedom of the press, all the while claiming to be a protector of such freedoms. In his 2024 campaign, after praising Elon Musk (who heavily sensors his social media platform X) as the savior of free speech, Trump called for ABC NEWS and 60 Minutes to be taken off the air, because they did things that he didn\u2019t like. What\u2019s more, Fox News, OAN, and now even Twitter (X), serves as a propaganda arm of his campaign, even going so far as to deny that he said things which he said on live television \u2014 like that he wants to turn the American military on the \u201cenemy within,\u201d which he defines as U.S. citizens who disagree with him. In true fascist style, Trump mistakes \u201cfreedom from criticism\u201d with \u201cfreedom of speech.\u201d\u00a0\n\n**5) Unreality:**\u00a0Fascism, through its propaganda, creates an alternate universe of non-facts that not only fails to match the way the world is, but conceptualizes every issue as an \u201cus vs. them\u201d contest, and sees its leader as the protector of truth, even as that leader tells blatant and obvious lies. (For example, Hitler spread lies about the rates of Jewish crime, while he was simultaneously seen as a \u201cspeaker of truth.\u201d)\n\nTrump\u2019s Big Lie about the 2020 election being stolen is a perfect example of creating such an alternate reality. His followers continue to believe in widespread election fraud despite a complete lack of evidence, and still view Trump as the only one telling the truth about that election. They also gullibly believe false rumors, like that legal Haitian immigrants in Springfield Ohio are eating pets, despite the fact that these rumors were not only false, but started by neo-Nazis and propagated by the KKK. Indeed, like Hitler did with the Jews, Trump has spread lies about crime rates being higher among immigrants when they are actually lower.\n\n**6) Anti-intellectual:**\u00a0Since respect for science, history, education, and expertise make it harder to spread lies, fascism must oppose science, history, education, and expertise. (Attacks on academics is one reason Einstein left Nazi Germany.)\n\nTrump consistently dismisses science, from denying climate change to promoting unproven COVID-19 treatments. He attacked experts and undermined academic and scientific institutions, branding educated elites as enemies of the people. His followers do the same, even berating the experts on fascism that say Trump is a fascist. Project 2025 plans to do away with the Department of Education and The National Weather Service.\n\n  \ncontinued\u2026\n\nwhat is the evidence that any modern president has expressed All the fascist characteristics as outlined below as trump has?", "label": 0}
{"text": "Part 4\n\n**10) Hyper Militaristic:**\u00a0Fascists are obsessed with the military and loyalty within it. (Hitler famously praised military service and was obsessed with having a large military that was loyal to him personally.)\n\nTrump\u2019s reverence for military parades and his desire to stage one in Washington D.C. mirrors the fascist obsession with the military. He also surrounded himself with military generals, while pushing for loyalty above all else, firing anyone he saw as insufficiently supportive. Indeed, it was recently revealed that, while in office, Trump said he wanted generals like Hitler had, which were loyal to the leader, and not the constitution or country.\n\n**11) Sexual Purity/False Accusations:**\u00a0Fascism plays on sexual anxieties by condemning any kind of sexual activity that violates proscribed norms (including chastity among men and sex outside of marriage in women) and (without evidence) accuses members of the \u201cout-group\u201d of participating in sexual activity that is not only outside those norms (e.g., homosexuality) but is violent and against the women (and children) of the in-group. (Mao did this. Putin does it now.\n\nTrump played on fears of sexual deviance when referring to Mexicans as \u201crapists\u201d and Muslim immigrants as threats to women\u2019s safety. At the same time, his administration installed the judges that overturned Roe, with the express purpose of allowing states to pass laws which regulated women\u2019s reproductive rights to control their bodies and sexuality. And the MAGA movement in general targets the LGBTQ+ community, especially transgender persons, which it constantly berates with false accusations of child sex abuse.\n\n**12) Pro-Masculine/Anti-Feminine:**\u00a0Fascism idolizes masculinity (and sees critical reflection as emasculating), and neglects giving women equal rights. It sees women\u2019s primary role as giving birth to children (to the men of the chosen race or in-group); Hitler actually gave an award (the Mother\u2019s Cross) to women for having an abundant amount of Arian children.\n\nTrump\u2019s bragging about sexual conquests and denigration of women in leadership roles shows his embrace of this ideal. His administration rolled back protections for women\u2019s rights, particularly in terms of reproductive health. MAGA acolytes are known for giving speeches that emphasize the idea that a woman\u2019s place is in the home at her husband\u2019s side.\n\n**13) Anti-Urban:**\u00a0Fascism demonizes large cities, and the people who live there, and casts them as one of the main causes of society\u2019s ills.

{"text": "Part 6\n\n**19) Purges the Disloyal:**\u00a0In fascism, there is a hierarchical party structure, and anyone who is not loyal enough (or who might replace the leader) is ousted.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency was marked by a constant purge of those he deemed insufficiently loyal, from his firing of FBI Director James Comey to his public humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Anyone who crossed him faced political exile. His Project 2025 strategy includes detailed plans for how to oust everyone not loyal to Trump from all government positions. It is the threat of such purges which has caused republicans who once berated him to embrace him. The same republicans that called him a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and \u201corange faced windbag,\u201d \u201ceverything I taught my children not to be,\u201d \u201ca race baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot,\u201d an exploiter of the working class, a \u201ccon-artist\u201d whose every word is a lie, a crazy \u201ckook\u201d who is \u201cunfit for office,\u201d who has \u201cnot read the constitution,\u201d \u2026 those same republicans not only now embrace him, but bend over backwards to excuse his misbehavior, even after he insults them. Dozens who said that Trump being directly responsible for the January 6th insurrection disqualified him from holding office, now make excuses for it and support his candidacy willingly.\n\n**20) Mass Mobilization:**\u00a0Fascism rises to power on a mass political wave that creates a new political party, like Nazism and Maoism.\n\nTrump has rallied a base that became a political force, leading to the formation of a new, far-right movement within the Republican Party. Indeed, it is widely regarded that the republican party died as it was replaced with the party of Trump; this is why so many mainstream republicans have left the party and endorsed his opponent.\n\nThe only element of fascism you will find in academic work on fascism that may not fit the MAGA movement is \u201cthe Fetishization of the Youth.\u201d Hitler famously targeted the young to brainwash them into loyalty; to date, Trump has not done that (although you do see this in the MAGA evangelical community). However, with the Trump campaign\u2019s recent targeting of the voting block of young men, this may be changing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFascism is a word that has been thrown around a lot since WWII; almost every American president has been called a fascist by someone or another. But only Trump has been called that by his own military generals and experts on the topic. Yes, the label can be misapplied \u2014 but The Boy Who Cried Wolf ends with the boy being killed by a wolf. We cannot let past hyperbole prevent us from calling a spade a spade.\n\nThe warning signs are all there, staring us in the face. Trump is a fascist leading a new American fascist movement. The fact that it hasn\u2019t happened before, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening now. And his first term is no indication of what his second term will be like. There are no more adults (like Gen. Milley and Gen. Kelly) in the room to stop him from using the military on American citizens (like they did in his first term). He has surrounded himself with \u201cyes-men,\u201d plans to purge everyone who could stop him, and the supreme court has already granted him criminal immunity for everything he wants to do. If we do not stop him at the ballot box now, the United States \u2014 and indeed the world \u2014 may never recover.\n\nwhat is the evidence that any modern president has expressed All the fascist characteristics as outlined below as trump Has?", "label": 0}

{"text": "So, you are refusing to address why Kamala Harris would make an ad addressing the reality that White men are discriminated against ?\n\n>literally gave you a long list of modern movies and you can\u2019t actually point to a single one?\n\nYou didn't give me a list of anything. Said you were going to post a link and then didn't do it.\n\n>And as for your stats on academia and whatnot: first up, just to be clear, you\u2019re not complaining about white people getting replaced by black or Hispanic folks or anything else, you\u2019re complaining about YOUR very specific variety of white people being discriminated against by another very specific variety of white people? What\u2019s so special about the inherent rights of your specific flavor that give you any right to complain?\n\nJewish people are middle eastern, they have semitic language known as Hebrew, which is a sub type of canaanite. Which is from modern palestine/lebanon/Syria/Jordan. Genetically, jews, including ashkenazi \"European\" jews, \"cluster\"(form a close group that's close because of genetic relation) with middle eastern people and arabs. Not Europeans. Ashkenazi \"European jews\", share a single pool of Y (paternal) chromosome haplogroups(biological lineages transmitted directly from father to son) with.... palestinians \nhttps://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/2015-10-20/ty-article/palestinians-and-jews-share-genetic-roots/0000017f-dc0e-df9c-a17f-fe1e57730000\n\nBecause jews are middle eastern\n\nJews do not identify with Whites. When jews think of Rome or the hellenistic empires or medieval European empires they do not see themselves. They see enemies. When jews think about their history, they do not think of knights and Charlemange. They think of Moses, and Egypt and Africa and Asia.\n\nHere's Ben Shapiro explaining to a young Black woman that he is jewish. Not White\n\nhttps://fxtwitter.com/fearedbuck/status/1849517389010043033?s=46&t=R06ONXrhjeIQ1qR6y6z9DQ\n\n>just to be clear, you\u2019re not complaining about white people getting replaced by black or Hispanic folks or anything else, you\u2019re complaining about YOUR very specific variety of white people being discriminated against by another very specific variety of white people? \n\nI'm complaining about systemic discrimination. The vast majority of black and Hispanic people are normal,decent good folks who are living their lives not trying to hurt any. both communities do have huge problems with crime, crime that often racially targets White people. But it's a tiny minority overwhelmingly majority of Blacks are just trying to live their lives. Jewish people are much more in position to harm White people and many seem to be operating as gatekeepers to prevent Whites from gaining access to for example the ivy league. But again it's not Jewish people in general or even necessarily a \"conspiracy\", more like historical experiences leading to a bias that leads to discrimination. Your a prime example of this Aa we speak. Dehumanization, see below \n\n\n\n> you\u2019re complaining about YOUR very specific variety of white people being discriminated against by another very specific variety of white people? What\u2019s so special about the inherent rights of your specific flavor that give you any right to complain?\n\nThis is called dehumanization. Again as above Jewish people are not White. They are middle eastern, from the afro-asiatic grouping of people's (Hebrew is an part of a language grouping called afro-asiatic. Israel uses DNA tests yo determine if someone is a jew and has \"right of return\"/aaliyah and ashkenazi Jewish shows up on dna tests as a specific group and that ethnicity does not cluster with Europeans but with the wider afro-asiatic grouping) \n\nA specific variety of people with a unique culture and history having a right to representation in government is called \"self determination\", a peoples right to determine their own destiny, it's foundational to international law and considered very basic,foundational level human rights and is in the UN charter, explaining principles of international law and the idea of humans inherently having rights.\n\nI have a feeling you would never question why black people \"deserve\" human rights and representation yet somehow you don't think i deserve the same consideration. That's called dehumanization. Treating me as less then human, unworthy of the very basic principles of human decency. The question is why you feel comfortable doing this ?\n\nLet's return to the top\n\n>So\u2026zero examples of this happening in any games I might have played, movies I\u2019ve seen, or tv shows I may have watched? Isn\u2019t that where this conversation started? You\u2019re saying the only example of what you\u2019re talking about on screen that you can actually point to is\u2026a Kamala Harris campaign ad?\n\nKamala Harris made an ad targeting White men and acknowledging mass discrimination of White men. Rather then acknowledging that you've chosen to hand wave away my lived experience  as a working class heterosexual protestant White male, because quite simply you have been acculturated to treat White males with disdain, to ignore and belittle our situation in this country, and to dehumanize me, viewing me as less then human and unworthy of basic respect in a way you would never do to a Black man, you would be repulsed and disgusted if you saw someone say \" Why does a black man have a right to complain about unfair treatment\". Because our culture treats Black men as human beings, but White men as less than.\n\nI don't need to provide specific examples from a list you did not give. I don't need to because it's self evident. So self evident, in fact that the Kamala Harris campaign decided to create ads targeting White males that begin with pointing out that \"we get it. Your sick and tired of being insulted and dehumanized constantly in this country so here's an ad that won't imply you're not human, won't lecture you about how much we openly and publicly feel comfortable describing our hatred for you, we're just going to offer \" no bs,no lectures, just real solutions to make life better for you and your family\"\n\n\nSo, we can use Occams razor here. Is it more likely that Kamala Harris is a toxic White supremacist, or that she made this Ad on this topic because it is actually in every form of media constantly, as she and I both are asserting ?\n\n>If you think she\u2019s so right about it why don\u2019t you vote for her?\n\nI may.

{"text": "Have I ever considered that 45.1 Million Americans have \"no legitimacy in a democracy\"?\n\n\nNo, because I'm an American and I believe that every American has legitimacy in our democracy, regardless of race, creed, or color.\n\n\nI also don't believe that 45.1 million Americans are evil. I also know that right wing extremism is more aggressive violent than left wing extremism. Data refutes the claim \"the most violent.....aggressive\".\n\n\n\"Through the first dataset, the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS), the researchers zeroed in on acts of extremism in the United States from 1948-2018. They found nearly no difference between the likelihood of an Islamist extremist and a right-wing extremist committing an act of violence; the probability of a violent act of extremism in the United States being committed by a left-wing extremist was found to be 0.33, 0.61 by a right-wing extremist, and 0.62 by an Islamist extremist.\"\n\n\nhttps://ccjs.umd.edu/feature/umd-led-study-shows-disparities-violence-among-extremist-groups\n\n\nAs far as the \"parasitic, useless\" claim goes, I'm aware that Biden-voting counties produce 70% of America's GDP.\n\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/biden-voting-counties-equal-70-of-americas-economy-what-does-this-mean-for-the-nations-political-economic-divide/\n\n\nAnd it's not just that blue counties produce more than red counties. Though there are exceptions, as a general rule red states are the parasitic states, taking more than they give, reliant on blue states to pay their way.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Eight of the 10 states that get the most money back from the federal government per dollar they pay into the system voted for Trump in 2020. Nine of the 10 states that got the least voted for Biden. The typical red state gets back 19 cents more for each dollar sent to Washington than its blue-state friends.\"\n\n\nBut personally, since you asked, I do not consider people I disagree with on tax policy or regulatory structure to be illegitimate people, aggressive and evil parasites who don't deserve to be part of American democracy. I consider people I disagree with to be neighbors, friends, family, coworkers, and equal to myself under the law.\n\n\nDo I shake my head at protestors with a Hamas flag and think them utter fools? Absolutely. Do I resent the dipshits who cause a resurgence of polio because \"vaccines cause autism\"? Of course. Do I despair when I see a crowd delight in promises of cruelty to be inflicted on their neighbors, family, and fellow Americans? It sickens me. But I don't think they have any less right to participate in our society than I do.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't even resent the taker states because, hey, they obviously need the help and we are one nation. If my tax dollars help feed a kid in the South, awesome. If my tax dollars help an elderly person in the Midwest get needed medicines, wonderful. Even if that Southern child or Midwestern person hates me for my race or gender, they are my countrymen. We have a duty to each other. That's what it means to be one country, under God.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm curious what daycare in your area costs per hour.\n\n I live in the Midwest, more rural area and a basic daycare runs $8.50/hr with the typical wage around $15-18/hr. It is not being uncommon for jobs in the area to only offer part time (to avoid paying benefits) and paying just above min wage - despite asking for an associates degree or higher.\n\nDo you think it's possible that a married couple without kids could be avoiding the need for welfare because they don't have to pay 1/3 - 1/2 of their pretax income to daycare, additional insurance/medical costs, a larger living space, additional food expenses, seasonal full wardrobe purchases due to children growing out of clothes or missing more work due to illness, Dr appt, etc that are not uncommon with children?\n\nIn my experience having 5 kids born between 1995 and 2008 and a grandson born in 2020, children can be incredibly expensive. Especially if you want to feed them nutritional food, house them in a safe environment, have them wear clothes that fit them and are seasonally appropriate - even if you buy secondhand, give them opportunities to participate in sports and activities either in or out of school, and provide them medical care when needed.

What\u2019s more, the single mothers managed all that while spending no less time caring for their children.\n\nThe study, \u201cMarital status and mothers\u2019 time use: Childcare, housework, leisure, and sleep,\u201d was published last year (February 2018) in the journal\u00a0Demography.\u00a0\" \n\n\nI'm confused as to how it is you both use those in academia to prove the point of view you agree with, but then claim that it's propaganda pushed by those masquerading as experts in academia when you don't agree. It's almost as if someone who has spent years doing peer reviewed studies and researching a topic couldn't possibly come up with results that don't align with your feelings about the topic - only someone with an agenda could come to a conflicting conclusion. By that logic credible sources you may cite that challenge my view points - well - they must be peddling in agenda driven propaganda. They couldn't actually be accurate or based in scientific fact. \n\nAs to the higher number of school aged children now being lgbtq or trans, it is almost as if it's not possible that those same kids could be raised by parents that make them feel safe enough to let others know their identity or orientation. Your statement that you have no problem with people living in different ways is disingenuous and inaccurate. You have no problem with it as long as you don't have to see it, hear about it, or accommodate for it. As soon as it's front and center it is a problem for you. The facts are that instances of lgbtq and trans has not increased at an alarming rate or in unusually significant percentages. However what has changed is parents/society expecting kids to deny it or hide in the shadows pretending to be someone they aren't. Those kids are not being treated like they are something to be shunned or quarantined like a disease. Crazy we wouldn't want to dehumanize children for trying to figure out who they are. \nThat being said - \nIf you have actual evidence of an adult sexualizing or grooming children might I suggest you call the authorities rather than thumping your exploitation theories on the internet to a bunch of strangers? \n\nSuggesting that being transgender is contagious is so off the deep end of conspiracies that it actually hurts my brain to think of the mental gymnastics it takes to come up with that theory and say it out load with your whole chest. Transgender people have been around for thousands of years. The term transgender really didn't exist until around the late 50's - 60's. \n\nExamples include.... \n\nAncient civilizations\n\nSome examples include the Sumerian priests of Inanna, who were described as androgynous and spoke their own dialect.\u00a0In ancient Greece, some gods were worshiped by galli priests who wore feminine attire.\n\nIndigenous peoples\n\nBefore European colonization, many indigenous peoples celebrated multiple gender identities.\n\nSouth Asia\n\nThe hijra are a third gender people of historical, spiritual, and cultural significance.\n\nSiberia\n\nThe Itelmens recognized a \u201cthird gender\u201d called \u201ckoekchuch\u201d to describe people assigned male at birth but who expressed themselves as women.\n\nNorth American Indigenous peoples\n\nThe Navajo n\u00e1dleehi and the Zuni lhamana are examples of fluid and third gender roles that have existed since pre-colonial times.\u00a0\n\nIf being trans is contagious - sounds like we have a 12,000 year global pandemic on our hands..  \n\n\nI terms of women in happy marriages... \n\nThe reality is that the highest percentage of married people in the US right now are between 40-64 and there are 3% more same sex marriages in that age range. In addition the instance of divorce among female same sex marriages are 3-4% lower than heterosexual counterparts regardless of age demographic. Same sex marriages also tend to be more formally educated and make on average 10k more per year than their heterosexual counterparts. Frankly based on statistics alone, my daughters have a better chance of being in a long term happy marriage with or without kids, where they are financially stable if they were gay. Not seeing the downside other than having to deal with people who make assumptions or devalue their lives because of the gender of their spouse.  \n\nDo you believe that the propaganda to promote lgbtq and trans in schools started 35-55 years ago and it's just now something you're seeing? \n\nWhat is your reasoning for suggesting that hormone birth control is detrimental to their health and well-being? \n\nDo you have knowledge of other medical treatments for endometriosis, uterine/ovarian cysts, menorrhagia, PCOS, or uterine fibroids that are effective and safe that don't require hormonal birth control?", "label": 0}

She's apparently dressing as a spider for Halloween, but won't let me make her extra legs because they would get in the way.  They'd be little legs, I promise!\n\nThere's a store called Bricks and Minifigs (or something like) that does DnD games with Lego.  I am a big fan of Mobile Frame Zero (they may have gone under, I don't know), which is basically Battletech/Gundam with Lego, so I'm going to go check things out today and maybe spend a few bucks on a minifig.  Hopefully.  Apparently the local store doesn't do the DnD thing, but one up about an hour away from me does.  I can handle that drive.\n\nRegarding the question!  I'm a bacon guy.  I make my own bacon.  Heck, since I've been posting recipes in here, and since I will likely be using this bacon in the next recipe, I might as well post it here.\n\n**BACON!**\n\n* Three pounds of pork belly (I will explain later)\n* 1 cup, packed, dark brown sugar\n* 1/2 cup sea salt\n* More black pepper than you think you would need.  Preferably freshly ground.\n* Whatever other herbs, spices, etc. you want in there.\n* I do not like using Prague Powder here, but if you want, a teaspoon is enough.\n\nNow, here's why I say three pounds.  It has been my experienced that a three pound slab fits almost perfectly into a gallon Zip-Lock bag.  This makes the curing process easy.  So effectively dump the belly into the bag (you can leave the skin on or take it off, it's fine either way) and mix all the dry ingredients together.  Dump the rub into the bag and give the belly a massage.\n\nFor the next four days, you are going to flip that bag when you wake up and when you get home, basically.  Give it a bit of a rub each time, but you're keeping it in the fridge and just turning it before and after work.\n\nAfter the four days, the cure is likely done (times may vary).  I like to smoke mine overnight over hickory or mesquite, but applewood is extremely popular.  Keep the heat low and slow and go at least four hours.  And then you have bacon!\n\nNote that this is a cured and smoked product and is fully cooked by the time it comes off the smoker, but it will not taste like it's fully cooked.  You'll want to cut it and fry it up, or roast it, or whatever to truly get the bacon experience.  But that's for later.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Social engineering as a science has been around since the late 1800s. Using colors to raise cortisol levels and fear to stimulate behavior was in the book \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders\u201d which was written in the 1950s. It was considered shocking information at the time, I think I read.\n\nEveryone who is trying to influence people uses at least some of these tactics to an extent. Some of it\u2019s instinctive. Social animals like birds do some social engineering behavior for example.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a field that uses social engineering you are taught some of these techniques. PR, marketing, advertising are some of the most obvious examples. The media can be put in the advertising category because it exists to sell ads. And collect data.\n\nI\u2019m aware that social engineering plays a big role in fields like law, law enforcement, military, medicine, education, HR, just about anything I guess because we are social animals. Organizations that are big enough hire experts like consultants, advertising agencies, PR firms, etc. to leverage their effectiveness.\n\nA lot of it is taught along the way, just not labeled as social engineering necessarily. For example if you\u2019re in school for graphic design you\u2019ll learn what colors and shapes arouse the emotions that you want the viewer to have. They don\u2019t necessarily explain that it stimulates the amygdala, but if you get deeper into it you\u2019ll find that out. \n\nSo in short - everyone does it. Right now there are industries that want laws to go a certain way and a lot of these industries are media industries. So they have a lot of influence. Depending on how far they are willing to go, some of them outright abuse people. Facebook, Snapchat, Netflix, Twitter, Google, those were some companies I wrote about in academic papers exploring how media exploits and harms.\n\nThe media companies attacking Trump aren\u2019t doing it out of any moral conviction. They are doing it because they see him and his supporters as a threat to their goals. \n\nWhat those goals are, well that isn\u2019t as easy to figure out because we\u2019re not meant to figure it out. Some media tactics still work if we know about them, because they affect the subconscious. I\u2019ll follow up with what I thought were the \u201csins\u201d of the organizations I mentioned, at the time I wrote the papers.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Have you taken the time to research why there is a student loan crisis in the first place? Predatory loan practices played a huge role. Many of these loans are structured like no other loan with a hefty portion of the payment going to interest instead of principal. In my case I borrowed. $42,000 for both my bachelors and masters. My loans were originally direct with the federal government with reasonable terms. But then they were sold and the terms changed without my consent. Once I realized I was paying much higher interest I refinanced only for my loans to be sold again. This cycle occurred seven times before I gave up and accepted I would be paying these loans well into retirement. In the end, I paid $95,000 over 23 years for $42,000 in debt and still had $24,000 in remaining balances when my loans were finally forgiven. The reason? The lenders took the majority of each payment and applied it to interest while applying very little to the principal while continuing to build interest on the very slowly reducing principal. If the loans I took had never been sold I would have paid them off in 10 years. I never missed a payment. I was never late. I paid what I borrowed plus the interest I agreed to and had no hand in the fleecing I was trapped in. I paid what owed times two and still had more than half the amount I borrowed in balance.

{"text": "Bit of a history primer. Nagorno-Karabakh is a rugged mountainous region encircled by Azerbaijan except for one real connection to Armenia in the Southwest. Under soviet rule the region was an self-governing territory, nominally under Azerbaijan.\n\nWhen the USSR collapsed, the 76.92% Armenian population of the region voted to re-unify with Armenia proper. Azerbaijan didn't like that idea and war broke out. The Armenians ended up winning the war and taking control of the region plus the part of Azerbaijan previously encircling it. Russia ended up mediating the ceasefire, but throughout the conflict they essentially backed the Armenians with weapons and aid.\n\nNaturally Azerbaijan gravitated towards our orbit after that loss. In the decades since, Azerbaijan became an American regional proxy. We have close military ties, maintaining a permanent American military presence and arm the Azerbaijani military.\n\nIn 2020 Azerbaijan resumed the war, and well equipped with Western weaponry won a pretty decisive victory. Azerbaijan regained all of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and captured one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh proper.\n\nAs part of the Armistice Russian peacekeepers stepped in to maintain the autonomy of the region and the corridor connecting it with Armenia.\n\nIn 2022, following the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, Azerbaijan completely encircled the region, cutting off all outside resources and beginning a siege.\n\nIn 2023 the Azerbaijani military invaded and conquered the region, [driving >80% of the population into Armenia.](https://www.rfi.fr/en/europe/20230930-nagorno-karabakh-almost-empty-as-most-of-population-flees-to-armenia)\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAnyways. Azerbaijan arguably had justification so far as re-capturing the territory they lost in the 90s, but they're definitely in the wrong conquering a non-belligerent democracy and driving it's entire population out.\n\nAs for exactly which levers we could have applied? I'm not going to dive into that, because they invaded with our permission.\n\nWhy would we greenlight a genocide? Because it make Russia look weak. \n\nTheir Military was and still is fully committed in Ukraine, so when Armenia invoked their mutual-defense treaty they got zero assistance. Armenia is irrevocably removed from the Russian orbit over it, and the rest of the satellite states are similarly unimpressed.\n\nI'm unconvinced it really made that much of a geopolitical difference aside from outing ourselves as massive hypocrites condemning a Russian war of aggression while supporting our own by proxy.\n\nAll that said, there's not a ton Trump can do at this point. He could try to pull Armenia into our orbit negotiating some kind of settlement, but that'd take a ton of leverage over Azerbaijan to make them hand back all the conquered territory. Hard to picture what we could give them to make that palatable.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm going to approach this from another angle here.  I'm sure he, at some point, violated something that would lead to deportation.  I've known people who have had to fight deportation over what amounted to a traffic violation.  *However*, he was not deported and is now, apparently, a US Citizen.  Sure, fraud can be considered grounds for revoking citizenship, but right now what we're seeing is targeted at him because he supports President Trump.\n\nI find it somewhat interesting that the same people saying \"(illegal) immigrants are a net benefit to society\" and now trying to go after Musk because he may have screwed up in college.  I also find it interesting that there are people defending him because he is on the \"Right\" side (see what I did there?).\n\nPersonally, I've known many people who were on probation (hi, I'm one of them!) who have messed up.  Some of them have landed back in jail, but for the most part, if your mess up is small, your PO will either handwave it because they don't want the hassle or slap you with a few more classes or a few more months or call you in more often for randoms.  I feel like visas should be treated similarly there.  If you messed up, you messed up, but the extent in which you did and what happened will determine what the correct course of action is to take, and there needs to be a human element involved as well.\n\nOf course, that does wind up favoring some over others.  In my case, I managed to befriend my PO and, so the one time I failed a UA (I did not know you could test for alcohol in a UA), my officer basically told me to knock it off, because he didn't want to have to deal with everything, and I listened.  If someone is here on a student visa and gets overwhelmed and needs to drop some courses, I'm okay with that, because hey, we all get overwhelmed.  I'm just about at whelmed right now, myself, so we will see if it gets to over.\n\nHaving money is a major advantage to navigate the US legal system.  Being somewhat charismatic helps a lot as well.    One of my very best friends was facing ten years in prison for some mushrooms and the like, and he was able to stay out and continue to support his family.  Another friend is on three years probation for about five dollars worth of meth (we have had this conversation with him, I love him, I do not support his habit).  In the first case, he had friends with money who were able to post bail, get him out, and one of us is a lawyer who negotiated things for him.  In the latter case, this guy is broke as a joke and three years probation for that seems a bit excessive.\n\nBut hey, did I weave enough yet?  Let's get back to the main question.  I do not think that a screwup means that you should be deported.  I believe that if you're doing something serious, you should be, or if you didn't declare asylum, or if your declaration was denied.  If you're here on an H1-B (which I hate, but not the person, the process) and your company goes under, you should have X amount of days to find a job before facing deportation.  If you overstay your visa, sometimes that's just an \"oops\" and you should have a grace period to attempt to renew it.  I know for a fact that I drove around with an expired license for about three months before I was pulled over (one of my lights was out) and the officer informed me that my license was expired and told me to go get it renewed.", "label": 0}
