{"text": "Maybe, if you try hard, you can be less of a condescending asshat. I don't think you're trying, though.\n\nLet's keep it real. You're not \"arguing for equality\" no matter how you try to spin it, but I'm sure describing it that way makes you feel better about it. Instead, you're championing it for no other reason than that your simplistic thought process leads you to believe that liberal = good and conservative = bad regardless of the actual issue. It's sports fan politics.\n\nAlso, not a conservative btw. But it's hilarious that you're able to decide that I am based on one issue. \n\nNow, as for the few *relevant* arguments you've made...\n\n>you specifically want rural voters to have more voting power than urban voters.\n\nThis only holds true in the national framework. Within a state, urban votes still win. It's as direct as you want nationals to be. \n\nThe difference (that you're deliberately avoiding addressing and in fact doing all you can to obfuscate) is that distance and states rights matter. California shouldn't be the unilaterally decisive voice about what happens in say, Vermont or South Dakota no matter how many people are in its borders.\n\nYou're also (disingenuously) ignoring that the EC system does account for population in assigning electors, which is why Texas has more in 2024 than it did in 2000 and California and New York have less, reflecting the shift seen in the most recent census.\n\n>Honestly, how do square that, from a personal morality standpoint? It's reprehensible, but you don't seem to care. I don't get it.\n\nYour hamfisted attempt to reframe this as a black and white moral issue where you're on the side of the angels is laughable, artless, and frankly, pretty fucking gross.", "label": 1}

There's only one way that happens.  One heartfelt, not fake (God can tell) prayer to Him.\nHere's what to pray to him... mix up the wording to make it in your own words, but pray with your mouth when you do it... and mean it.\n1) Tell him you're a sinner and you need a savior. \n2) Tell him you know he died on the cross and shed his blood... blood you know that will wash away all your sins and purify you.\n3) Ask him to put the Holy Spirit in you.\n4)  when you end your prayer. End it with not just \"Amen\" but with... \" In Jesus's name, I pray, Amen\"\n\nThen watch as your life starts to transform for the better.  You'll feel convection to be a better person and you won't know what happened to you.  It's called rebirth. \n\nAt that point you'll see clearly, and your name goes into the book of life... which means you will go to heaven for eternity.   Instead of hell for eternity. \n\nBut the people who choose their own path or not humble themselves... there's unfortunately only one direction for that group.  I feel pain in my heart for all the lost souls we'll likely witness in our lifetime.   The world is spiraling downward in a hurry.   If you've seen destruction increasing, haters hating, sexual abuse increasing. Earthquakes and \"natural\" disasters increasing like crazy since Covid,  increasing prices of food, gas, rent, everything... AND SO MUCH MORE... then don't kid yourself, this is NOT sustainable folks.  Wake up, get saved.  Stop sinning,  stop giving into those fleshly desires that evil wants you to crave.  The very evil you won't escape soon, but don't let it be too late for you.  If you're luke warm on Christ today, time to repent and turn to Him... time IS running out.  I know you're tired of false teachers in churches, God will deal with those who misrepresented them.  Look after you and your families though.   I'm not going to give you dates or feed you full of false doctrine, or claim to know it all... I just know He loves you but there's only one narrow path, it's not an easy path in this test we call life.  But the rewards don't have words for it.   All good though, I have faith in that.  Join us in faith, through your own private worship of the only savior WE all need or we've all denied at some point in our lives.  Love Jesus today my brothers and sisters.   God Bless", "label": 1}

Shit give me $1  billion. I will hook up personally 1,000 people with Star Link. Another one of her failures is the economy it's just horrible what she has done with letting in all these immigrants they have bankrupted cities all across America, which funds should be used to help with hurting Americans. Another huge downfall is that she was not elected by 1 person she was installed by democratic elites. The big one is she fails to secure are country from WAR and young Americans know that they are on the chopping block if she is elected they are the ones going to war to fight because her administration cannot and will not have meetings with world leaders that we have conflicts with.

The act was the culmination of a bi-partisan effort to improve criminal justice outcomes, as well as to reduce the size of the federal prison population while also creating mechanisms to maintain public safety.  \n  \nOf the nearly 30,000 people released under the First Step Act, only 12.4% have been re-arrested or returned to federal custody. This is far lower than the general federal recidivism rate of 43%. Below are descriptions of the First Step Act's sentencing and prison reforms, why they matter, and who they benefitted.  \n  \nAccording to data from the Sentencing Project, a significant portion of individuals released under the First Step Act were Black men, with reports stating that roughly two-thirds of those benefiting from the Act were people of color, indicating a substantial impact on the Black community", "label": 1}

It doesn't make logical sense bc it isn't logic, its stupidity. Americans are by and large just idiots. \n\nThe economy- you needed to be training Americans fir four years to hate trump bc his rock bottom interest rates wrre naturally going to cause inflation. You needed to be very very vocally pushing legislation to limit price gouging and greedflation. Harris was vp, this wasn't done, why would anyone support her unless they already understood the things they never explained?\n\nAbortion is a major issue, it's not as major as democrats think. Look at any election map. Click each state. Everywhere you look even in \"blue states\" its red everywhere. The vast majority of placed where you can live in the US geographically, are red. And most of that red is made up of religious conservatives. A LOT of women are FOR BANNING ABORTION. How many articles of leopards eating their faces have come out where they didn't realize how utterly fucked they were on e they needed an abortion desperately only to be denied and even hunted for daring to go out of state? People WILL vote to kill themselves for religions sake and racism sake. People are that stupid.\n\nBiden sticking around and the democrats failing to go through the correct process to get a candidate was a huge failure, a missed opportunity to, god forbid, genuinely build up support for a candidate and put the best one out there. I don't know a single person on earth who thinks kamala is the best and brightest Democrat that could've run. Never understood the vp choice other than the idiotic hubris of thinking that making history was at all important to a mostly dumb, racist, sexist America that votes against its own rights and survival.\n\nDemocrats utterly lost the plot, Republicans lost their party to a cult and America lost massively.

If you walk in with a busty chest and long hair, but insist that your name is Brad, and you are a male, and that mistaken, you for a woman is deeply offensive\u2026 Most of us find this to be bullshit. We are happy to use whatever pronoun you want, but you have to give us some grace because we simply do not understand gender, identity, and gender fluidity.\n\nOn another topic, Democrats need to find a way to communicate with working class in a way that does not sound like a lecture. When someone says that the economy is bad and that they feel the effects of prices rising, the response cannot be an economics 101 lecture about how the United States has handled inflation better than any other developed country in the world (true), how inflation has come down over the past four years (true), that unemployment is down (true), and how Harris deserves the opportunity to carry on the Biden Legacy.
