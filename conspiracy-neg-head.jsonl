It would require significant mining, production, and employment shifts which holds its own overall cost. If this was just about wages, then it might be a simple shift, but it's not.\n\n\nThe second is that Tariffs are mercurial in nature. They are not a static thing, but are negotiated and manipulated constantly. Simple example: where 1 president might raise them, another could lower them within 4 years. It may take a decade to even get close to staus quo internal production. Basically it means that businesses can wait.\n\n\nIf the US never got rid of its production capabilities, or planned in advance, we would be having a different conversation as Tariff increases would be viable.

Besides being a massive tax cut for the rich, it also captures, with a wide net, all those that don't pay anything at all (criminals, illegals and others in the underground society, etc.), because although not everybody can buy a yacht, everybody needs a gallon of milk from time to time.\n\nThe rich pay accountants handsomely to ensure that they're maximizing their deductions within the 55000 to 75000 pages of current tax code (including IRS administrative rulings and case law).  Do you really think they're just filling out a 1040EZ form and paying the tax due?  In fact, ask around, people everywhere are always looking for the exceptions and loopholes.  Even TurboTax makes \"suggestions\" when filing.\n\nThe article I attached is old, but, there was an analysis done a few years ago, and I can't find it.  Some economists sat down with the Cain plan and analyzed how it would have done over a period of years.  The conclusion was with no change to any of the behemoth code, by the time of their analysis it would potentially be bringing in a surplus.\n\nThat same study recognized the potential \"imbalance\" that this article mentioned, and basically said that with smart changes to the tax code, besides putting an entire sector out of work (accountants), just using pre-taxed income of many large businesses that unleash their mathematical army loose on those forms and deductions, getting the actual full 9% of the gross income, unencumbered, was going to be epic!\n\nThat was their takeaway.  Yes, the 2011 article was correct, however, sensible changes in the code would make it incorrect, and we may even reach a point where 9-9-9 was too high.\n\nLet's agree not to reduce it to 6-6-6 tho . . .", "label": 0}

{"text": "Excerpt from article:  \"A great deal of evidence points to Serena (and Venus) being male. In addition, many people believe that Mr. Richard Williams actually adopted them. That makes sense, because I don\u2019t think he would have abused his biological kids like that (and by that time, he already had 6 kids of his own from a previous marriage anyway). Besides, I don\u2019t think his wife Oracene would have allowed him to do that to her kids. Furthermore, if you wanted to adopt kids on the down low from a rough place like Compton, you could probably find someone there who would be willing to give you 2 kids if you paid them enough money. And there would be no records of the transaction, so it would stay a secret. Or he could have even adopted one or both of them from another country\u2014who knows. If they are adopted, it\u2019s entirely possible that neither Venus nor Serena knows about it. As part of his elaborate hoax, I doubt Mr. Williams would\u2019ve told them the truth.  \n  \nHere\u2019s an informative excerpt from a news article:  \n  \n*When up late watching TV one night in 1980,*\u00a0\\[Richard\\]\u00a0*turned the channel to see Romania's Virginia Ruzici receive a check for winning a tennis tournament that he describes as \"a*\u00a0***hell of a lot of money***\u00a0\\[apparently about $40,000\\]\u00a0*for four days' (work).\"*  \n  \n*\"I went to my wife and said that we have two kids, and*\u00a0***we'll become rich****. They're going to be tennis players.\"*  \n*A 78-page blueprint was soon prepared, describing how Venus and Serena would reach the top.*\u00a0\\[emphasis added\\]  \n  \n(From the article:\u00a0[http://baltimoretimes-online.com/news/2015/dec/16/richard-williams-i-was-close-being-killed-so-many-/?page=2](http://baltimoretimes-online.com/news/2015/dec/16/richard-williams-i-was-close-being-killed-so-many-/?page=2)\u00a0)  \n\\*this has been scrubbed from the internet  \nAs he stated himself, Mr. Williams was primarily motivated by one thing:\u00a0**money**. And it seems he was willing to do just about anything to reach that goal\u2014a 78-page plan is incredibly long. Why on earth would you need such a complicated plan if you just wanted to raise 2 tennis stars? Did any parents of famous tennis stars from the past have such complicated plans? On the other hand, if you were planning something devious and underhanded, such an intricate plan would make sense.\"", "label": 0}

{"text": "The stories were overblown. It was from one city, and one black market distribution network. \n\nBasically, they took weed carts and cut them with vitamin E acetate. They likely chose this chemical because they 1) figured it was a vitamin (thus harmless) and 2) it has the same color and consistency of weed carts. \n\nThe problem is, they aren't doctors and they didn't do proper research, and inhaled vitamin E acetate is very, very damaging to the lungs, and a handful of people got pretty sick. It was pretty much an isolated incident, but the media ran with it (like they do with everything) and fear mongered and made it seem like it was some widespread issue. It wasn't. It was a couple of dumb asses. \n\nAlternatively, you could be referencing the \"concerns\" over \"pop corn lung\" from vaping. It's been frequently used (by companies that will profit from the downfall of vaping no less)  as a fear mongering news story about the dangers of vape. Thing is, those concerns are 1000% over blown. First of all, the chemical that causes popcorn lung (diytel. The chemical that has a buttery/creamy flavor) needs to be inhaled at very, very large amounts for a good length of time in order to be harmful (as in, say, in an industrial setting in a pop corn factory where they are using super concentrated forms of it to flavor 1000s of pounds of popcorn on a daily basis, hints the name of the condition). In the concentrations it used to be found within vape (more on this in a second), like .0001% of the total 60 mL, its completely harmless (and we know it's harmless at those levels, because the food industry has studied it extensively for many decades). But even still, well before the government decided to step in and regulate vape (at the request of the tobacco companies) pretty much every single reputable company out there removed diytel as a flavor in any of their formulations, because there was a *small* concern within the community that prolonged, low dosage exposure may be damaging to the lungs (no science was involved in this situation). This never made the news.  And it stayed that way for 5-6 years. It wasn't until the big tobacco companies and the government shut down all the small ecig companies out there (by regulating them to death and making the cost of operation so expensive that only the biggest companies could compete) that this concern ever became news worthy. \n\nI could continue to rant about the history of the ecig community (of which, I've been a member of since 2006) and how it's a perfect example of a conspiracy, and how almost everything out there about it today is propaganda.  In one of my university chemistry courses I did a whole laboratory study as well as meta analysis of the data currently available about vape and it's health impacts (we have been conducting studies of the major compounds found in vape, i.e. PG/VG since atleast the 1920s. The actors guild did an extensive, years long study on the effects of stage fog on actors, and the chemicals they use for stage fog is the same they use in vape, and they found no health impacts even with long term (decade+) exposure).

The Zimbabwean dollar became virtually worthless, and the government eventually abandoned it in favor of foreign currencies.\n* **Germany (Weimar Republic, 1920s)**: After World War I, Germany faced massive reparation payments, leading to hyperinflation. By 1923, the mark had lost so much value that people needed wheelbarrows full of money to buy basic goods. The government ultimately introduced the Rentenmark to stabilize the currency.\n* **Venezuela (2010s-present)**: Political instability and reliance on oil exports have contributed to Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis and hyperinflation, which peaked at nearly 10 million percent in 2019. The bol\u00edvar lost most of its value, and the government issued new currency denominations multiple times to combat the inflationary spiral.\n* **Hungary (1945-1946)**: After World War II, Hungary experienced one of the worst hyperinflations in history. At its peak in July 1946, prices were doubling every 15 hours, and the country issued the highest denomination banknote ever recorded, the 100 quintillion peng\u0151, before replacing the peng\u0151 with the forint.\n* **Yugoslavia (1990s)**: During the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars of the 1990s, hyperinflation hit the Serbian dinar. Inflation peaked at an estimated 313 million percent per month in 1994, leading to severe economic hardship and a currency replacement.\n* **Argentina (1980s and 2000s)**: Argentina has experienced multiple economic crises, with hyperinflation in the 1980s and again in the early 2000s during its debt default. Both instances led to the peso losing much of its value and the government implementing drastic monetary reforms.\n* **Greece (1940s)**: During the German occupation in World War II, Greece experienced hyperinflation, which decimated the value of the drachma. By 1944, inflation was so high that the government had to introduce a new drachma to restore stability.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yea cause he's such a good moral person who never lies or hurts people. Man it's like you guys are so far gone from the brainwashing youve completely lost yourselves.\u00a0\n\n\nLet's say in your example he's a good guy and is bringing them all down. Why come out now against these people, why not after his first visit to those parties or the island did he not immediately start ringing the alarm bells? Let's say he thought the people there were too powerful and thought he couldn't, why did he keep going to the parties and the island?\u00a0\n\n\nI know if I went to an island or a party where i saw a bunch of pedophiles raping children, I would not only be scarred for the rest of my life, I would never step foot near any of those people ever again. I would tell the world what was happening no matter the cost. I would definitely sacrifice my life to save those kids and try to stop these pedophiles from ever doing that again. It's an easy decision to save those children, why didn't he try anything?\n\n\nLet's say he didn't have the power then and was a scared little bitch that was afraid of these people. Why didn't he do anything when he was president? He was arguably one of the most powerful people on the planet and again he did nothing. He knew who the people were and didn't even attempt to go after them or even shame them publicly. And just a few weeks ago in an interview when asked if he would release the Epstein list he hesitated and said he wasn't sure because some people could be damaged if that came out because there's a lot of phony stuff in that world. Yea ok buddy maybe just release them and let the world decide. All of a sudden he's worried about phony stuff? Who's he trying to protect because he has had no problem with phony accusations in the past and even recently when the cats and dogs thing was debunked he doubled down again and starting saying what about the geese. He gives more of a shit about some migrating geese than releasing the Epstein list because he is protecting someone and there is only one person he protects.\n\n\nOf course releasing the list should be damaging, that's what should happen to pedophiles. Why would someone try to protect pedophiles? Just be honest with yourself for a few minutes and really think if you would be caught dead at that island or party or even that jet knowing what is going on. You wouldn't and if you would, someone needs to check your browser history and check your backyard.\n\n\nI feel like we are all going insane here! I mean how can you guys go to bat for a politician in the first place? Let alone someone like that.\u00a0\n\n\nIf 12 years ago, even if untrue, it came out that a black man with 34 felonies who was cheating on his pregnant wife and then paid her to keep quiet who also praised hitler behind closed doors and saluted north korean generals who also had secret calls with Russia who also stole from his own charity and can longer be near charities and had bankrupted nearly every business he had ever owned and wont release his tax returns or birth certificate or medical reports and was friends with possibly the two biggest pedophiles to ever exist and called them good friends who like young women as much as he does and was accused of walking into underage dressing rooms and accused of raping a 12 and 13 year old at one of the pedophiles parties and also a potential drug problem, you cannot honestly tell me that you would vote for someone like that even if all of that was untrue. When everything is covered in shit and smells like shit, it's probably shit. And when decorated 4 star generals and many other highly respected individuals come out against a person it's probably not a conspiracy, it's probably the truth.\n\n\nThe biggest problem I have is the unwavering devotion to someone who hates you. Who would sell you out for a few dollars. If it's not brainwashing, I want you to do an exercise where you search on the Internet and find a few things you don't like about him and then find someone close to you who also supports him and tell them what you don't like. Just see their reaction and see if they turn on you and call you names or a rino. You should be able to criticize a politician because they are a person and people are imperfect. He himself admitted he was a \"mostly truthful\" person on Andrew Shultz podcast the other day which in his own words called himself a liar.\u00a0\n\n\nI want you to know I'm not some diehard liberal and I have no problem sending Biden to jail or anyone else who is breaking the law and trying to cover up crimes. I read every news source on a story and read many forums/podcasts and listen to both sides and then determine the most likely truth. Both the Democrats and the Republicans have problems but most of the smell is coming from one person, Donald. And the project 2025 stuff is heinous and all you have to do is read it for yourself.\n\n\nI just want to see our society improve and get better and take care of our people, every single one and not just one side. Whoever reads this, I care about you and want you to live a happy life and be successful. I want all of us to work towards something better and not tear each other apart over some lying politicians. I don't have an agenda, I'm just some guy sitting on a couch frustrated because I see my fellow citizens ripping each other apart over algorithms and propaganda.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you don't want yourself and others to succeed what do you want? There is more than enough for everyone if we can rid ourselves of these evil corporations and these awful billionaires. We just have to realize the power is ours we just have to work together and take it back.", "label": 0}

We need more politicians willing to not beat around the bush and avoid answering questions.\n\nI look at what he did in his 4 years as president. The Abraham Accords were a significant step in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East. At the same time, due to sanctions and trade restrictions imposed by Trump, Iran was struggling to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthis. Then you have his willingness to open dialogue with North Korea. Stepping across the DMZ was a powerful moment in showing the US's willingness to bring actual Peace to the Korean peninsula. He secured the border, more or less, and was only prevented from doing so fully by Democrats. The world is slipping into instability and our current leaders are pushing us towards the edge. They torpedoed all peace talks with Russia. The parallels to pre-WW1 and pre-WW2 are obvious, yet our leaders continue to escalate.\n\nYou say he's compromised. Compromised by who? Russia? That's been debunked 10-fold. The only thing in the Mueller report that connected him to Russia was a potential licensing deal for the Trump name on a hotel, negotiated by none other than Michael Cohen, which ultimately did not happen.\n\nCompromised via some Epstein connection? He was the only high-profile witness to testify against Epstein. And he has committed to releasing everything on Epstein.\n\nIsrael? Israel only exists because it is the US and UK's will that it exists as a western outpost in the Middle East. Only groypers and Hamas supporters believe that Israel somehow controls the US and not the other way around.

Maybe there were even more, we don't know.\n\n\nI typically find, if someone is just throwing around a big number like this, it's probably because they have an agenda they want to push and they think this is the best way to push it.

{"text": "Im sorry, but this whole post is such nonsense and lack of history knowledge. because first of all you can't compare Yugoslavia to Ukraine as Yugoslavia had a civil war and was a multi-ethnic state which was also the reason for this conflict and Ukraine which is a mono ethnic state and which is NOT the reason for the war. And second of all, provoked how? By wanting to be alive? Russia is a threat they always were they killed 10 million Ukrainians (in whole Russian history) by starving and persecuting them. They killed out russian native people (Circassians, Ichkerians and etc.) and basically all folks under Russia suffered from genocide (Poles, Romanians, Kazakhs), so ofcourse Ukraine wanted to join NATO, because they want to live. And giving land won't solve anything? It will only escalate the conflict. Imagine the first time you invaded, you were allowed to get some land, why not try the second time, or third? Russians in Ukraine are a different subject, how are we supposed to treat them after what they did to us? The Odesa house wasn't burned by Ukrainians, Ukrainians actually helped them out of the fire, and my dad also witnessed it. The president that wanted a good relationship with russia (I think u refer to Yanukovich) was kicked out because of other reasons, first of all he lied to the Ukrainian people about Eurointegration, used violence on people, limited free speech, stole money from Ukrainian people and built enormous mansions (I've been to one as its a museum now), developed corruption so much that we still struggle to this day and when people had enough and some students decided to peacefully protest they were beaten by government police. Last name policy is also indeed a thing, but since the documents are in Ukrainian, we have to write them in Ukrainian, f.e. i have a russian last name (\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0451\u0445\u0438\u043d) but you can't write it like that in Ukrainian as it doesn't have the letter \u0451 so its written down as (\u041c\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043e\u0445\u0456\u043d). Russians in Ukraine and basically in other post soviet countries are a huge threat, they spread propoganda like your neighbor did because it's far from truth and it's easy to research and I don't blame nor you nor people who share your point of view but please do your research and dont state your facts based on \"trust me bro\" everything I have said is easy to find and everything I've said is honest. Again, this war is not because Ukraine has made russia start it, but because russians can't stay at home and mind their own business.", "label": 0}

A virus could be released that does do just that. Or a \"vaccine\" that does. The technology is available to make a virus that kills any gene-specific population and leaves others unharmed. They simply could have and it didn't do that. Maybe it is a 'long game' type tactic, and it's designed to shorten our lives, kill of slowly, but I lean more towards DNA alterations. We do see (covered up and not covered by most mainstream news) an unprecedented increase in miscarriages and infertility since the global \"vaccine\" though.

{"text": "I think a lot of this has to do with Western culture and socialization of what is \"happy\" and \"sad\" in music. I recommend. Listening to a lot of foreign folk music and trying to recreate ancient music, we see a lot of things that we might identify as sad as something more neutral or happy. I suggest listening to Gamelan music and seeing how it varies a lot in what we expect certain things to sounds like.\n\nAlso, as a violinist, we play everything from sad to angry to happy. And same with saxophones or trumpets or cellos. These are merely tools to recreate vibrations and for us to interpret what these vibrations mean.", "label": 0}

We are gonna make America great again\" and it openly acknowledges that it's repeating that same theme this time with a different subject. So it's essentially like a meme, making fun of a meme, making fun of itself which in turn makes fun of the very concept of 'memedom'....so it becomes a sort of commentary on this aspect of internet culture.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Crooked fking farce.  I will absolutely never trust the results of elections done in this manner.  Which is probably what they want.  They want this country torn asunder.  \n\nI had faith in our elections up until 2020.  I always believed that there was some fraud but not really enough to effect things in most cases.  The channges made in 2020 though present a completely different scenario. \n\n\nNow they have 30 mil illegals with no legal repercussion if they decide to vote as well. I am sure they will since Biden admin buys them plane tickets and gives them 15k debit cards..There is no downside whatsoever to them voting either... tucker did a segment on it. (tucker interviews catherine englehardt) If they think or claim they are a citizen illegal or not there is absolutely no legal repercussion against them for voting and of course they aren't gonna be arrested or deported... they won't even be caught because the left will allow this in all their dominated areas. So why wouldn't they try.... course once immigrants get here a lot of them turn conservative because they don't wanna see the country ruined by further unchecked immigration. America will only be worth living in as long as it remains the country that was built over the last centuries to try and be totally destroyed in the last decade or so by the left.\n\nI think most of the covid response maybe covid itself may have all been to add a layer of control yes, but also mainly to enact the mail in voting in the us to steal the 2020 election which is obvious is what happened\n\nMail in voting cannot be secured.  That is why we came up with better methods 100 years ago.  That is why every single metric we have established over the last 100 years was broken last time as well.  No bell wethers, I mean even ai says it mathatically impossible when asked about it in a non presidential way.\n\nAll you have to do is find the registered voters that don't vote, the old the infirmed etc, harvest those ballots, fill out for preferred candidate, drop rinse, repeat.  Then you can cover windows and fake water leaks in the middle of the night and run them through under the cover of darkness when democracy truly dies. \n\nWithout contacting every single mail in voter and verifying votes with identity, no proof of fraud will ever be found.  Its why it shouldn't be allowed in a towns mayoral race let alone our presidential elections.  The entire world laughs at us for how sloppy  and insecure they are.  I have seen euro liberals even laughing about it on 4chan.\n\nMail in allows the possible fraud numbers to go into the millions.  The fraud votes will continue to rise and rise until every single registered voter in the US is voting and that will be funny to see.  I suspect by that time there wont be much of a country left though.  Then they pull shut like .7 for biden vote .3 for Trump just everything they do is crooked, course can't be transparent with data either. \n\nTo have had faith in this system my entire life over 50 years and trust the results and agencies to have that ripped away from us in 2020 is ridiculous.  I feel like we live in one of those fake banana republics the letter agencies create.  I don't know what the solution is I have never heard so much talk of civil war and revolutions online.  I hope it doesn't resort to that.  I think we could restore most of the faith we had in elections by just rolling back the 2020 changes made during covid.  Which is obviously over and they are no longer needed.", "label": 0}
