She has made taken a stance against rampant capitalism and Elon, is essentially that. A mega billionaire. He has made numerous attempts to win her back including at one point selling all of his homes, trying to distance himself from the idea of a billionaire galavanting on private jets with properties everywhere. \n\nUnfortunately for Elon, I suspect that because he's kinda autistic so he does not know how to reconnect with his daughter, and this rift has just driven him to become resentful of the left, and found acceptance on the right.", "label": 0}

There is only one place for that.\n\nMid term, he is hoping to be saved. Full government backing for all things Musk. Space X replaces NASA as a whole, twitter is becoming the offical state funded US free speech platform, and all vehicles in government service will be Teslas from now on.

{"text": "You seem to be misunderstanding how a studio works. There is no one style for Trigger. I already gave you examples but here are some more. Kill la Kill, BNA, Promare, Cyberpunk, Little Witch Acadamia are all Studio Trigger but have different style of animation and story. Now looking at just these, Kill la Kill, Cyberpunk, and Promare fit the description you gave of cartoonish style but this is not typical of the others. This is simply the works of the same director Hiroyuki Imaishi. This is HIS style, not Trigger as a whole.  \n\n  \nNow look at my other examples. They too have their own style that is different from Hiroyuki because the both have a different director named Yoh Yoshinari. You claim that watching enough anime will make you able to tell them apart from studios. You are part right. What meant to say is that it will help you tell the DIRECTORs apart.  \n\n  \nNow go watch Star Wars Visions season 1 and see if your observation skills can tell you which two episodes are from Trigger. I'll give you hint they are each done by a different director and one of them is indeed that cartoonish motion that you mentioned. The other episode however is not.\n\n  \nYour view on Edgerunners 2 may be correct but it is just an opinion. The only thing I'd look forward to is how any studio, Trigger included, makes it their own story in that setting. This is what will make it good or not. It shouldn't be an objective to continue on with Season 1. Just make a new compelling story and it could even turn out better.", "label": 0}

I watched star wars visions without researching the studios ahead of time, and and twins episode was immediately recognizable as Trigger. The other I do not recall the details of, but I looked up the director who did the other one (Masahiko Otsuka) and he has a long history with Trigger making stuff in their specific style. The director of a show can change from episode to episode, but Gurren Lagann was the same totally bonkers action from start to finish. \n\nIf another studio was forced to adopt the Trigger style and make a season 2 it would be a disaster. That almost certainly wont be the case because it would be a waste of resources. The reason I worry is because scifi is quite rare in the anime industry and when it does appear its usually more introspective than fun. \n\nLets take an example of the opening scene. What was happening was pretty messed up, but trigger in their totally ridiculous style made it feel so over the top that I doubt it freaked many people out. If Production IG did the opening scene of Edgerunners it would have been much more grounded and horrific to watch, likely meant to actually make the viewer afraid of cyberpsychos.", "label": 0}
