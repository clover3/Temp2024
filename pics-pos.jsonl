Yes, people actually started ingesting disinfectants like Lysol last week. While Trump claimed his comment was sarcastic on Friday, he once again took no responsibility for the consequences resulting from his stupid remarks. When asked about the increase in people using disinfectants improperly, Trump replied: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d during a White House news conference Monday. He failed to once again acknowledge the severe consequences his words have for some Americans.\n> \n> Popular disinfectant companies like The Clorox Company and Reckitt Benkiser, the parent company of both Lysol and Dettol, quickly released statements emphasizing that their products should not be consumed. Despite warnings from healthcare providers and other officials, people acted on Trump\u2019s advice and ingested chemicals, including bleach, across the country.

{"text": "This isn\u2019t finished, still have a lot to add- but don\u2019t wanna leave you guys hanging- so here is the first bit (much much more to say, this is going to be a DEEP dive, as things of importance should be)\n\nI will not let you down, you will get facts from me- but for now let\u2019s set the stage:\n\nu/latebloomerbaloo - sorry just landed in China and it took awhile to set up my Nomad eSIM. I have taken few hours to type up the following. I hope you find it as compelling as I have. \n\nSo here are a couple of exercises in logic for you both and all reading this later:\n\nFirst, the Bible has a large number of prophecies, over 2,500 of them in fact, and at least 2,000 of them have been fulfilled- some of which, we have all, even self proclaimed Christians\u2014 overlooked. I\u2019ll go into a few of them soon!\n\nSecondly there are also several instances where historical places, people and events are mentioned, that directly coincide with secular records we have. At the very least, this proves the Bible is somewhat accurate and a little more in fact, than simply a \u201cbook of fables\u201d. I\u2019ll describe a few instances of this that I have found compelling.\n\nQuick backstory on me- I am a producer, I primarily work in research and development. I\u2019m not perfect by any means- but the take away is that I have the intrinsic motivation needed to go down rabbit holes of reading material and go the extra mile to track down interesting information. All this to say, I\u2019m not just a religious nut yelling \u201cthe Bible is real! Have faith!\u201d I put in effort here, which I hope you will recognize.\n\nProphecies- \n\n1. many people have heard of the ancient city of Tyre. It was originally founded in 2750BCE and is/was one of the oldest and longest lasting cities in the history of the world. \nFirst, a brief history on the city:\n\nIt was divided into 2 sections, old Tyre, which was the mainland (where there were coastal villages) and new Tyre, which was heavily fortified island city state with a north  harbor (toward Sidon) and south harbor (toward Egypt)\n\nThe city of Tyre is mentioned in the Bible over 30 times- in some cases casually amongst other cities, and in other cases in prophecy. Bear in mind these prophecies were written decades if not millennia before the predictions came true.\n\nTyre is first mentioned in the Bible via the book of Joshua which was written somewhere between 1500BC and 550BC, a good 1,500+ years into Tyre existence. While the events recorded in Joshua happened in approximately 1406BC, the book itself was either compiled far prior, or during the exile and captivity of Jewish people by Babylonian hands from 597BC to 538BC until they were freed by the Persian King, Cyrus the Great. \n\nWe know that from 1,000BC and 962BC that Israel had good relations with Tyre (during King David\u2019s reign) and had formed an alliance with Hiram, the King of Tyre. David used woodworkers and stonemasons, as well as cedars from the forests of Lebanon to build David\u2019s palace: (2nd Samuel 5:11, and further reading in 1 Kings 5:1-14, 1 Kings 9:11, and 2nd Chronicles 2:3 indicate that these good relations continued into Solomon\u2019s rule)\n\nRelations with Tyre entered into to a state of abeyance until King Ahab ascended to the throne. (Reigned from 874BC till his death in 853BC) Ahab renewed the alliance with Tyre by marrying Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal of Sidon, which at the time had been consolidated into 1 kingdom with Tyre. \n\nEthbaal, also known as as Ithobaal, was the priest of a pagan god called Baal. Ethbaal took control of Tyre by killing its previous King, Phelles, whose existence we only know about because the ancient historian, Josephus wrote about him and Ethbaal in his citation of Phoenician author, Menander of Ephesus, in the book, Again Apion I.18. \n\n(Menander was a Greek historian who lived around 2BCE, whose works have unfortunately been lost to time and only exist now in the form of various citations by other historians)\n\nANYWAYS- now the stage is set. Ahab and his pagan queen rule northern Israel and Jezebel sets her heart on upending conservative values with her zeal for this false god, Baal. She brings with her zeal a host of morals that are common in the ancient world at this time, by at direct odds with Israelites. (Idolatry, religious prostitution, and there is even evidence of child sacrifice etc)\n\nAnyways Jezebel ended up declaring war on the prophets of God and has most of them put to death. \n\nThis begins a significant decline in the northern kingdom of Jerusalem which eventually leads to them being conquered by Assyria in 721BC. (This kingdom fell within 150 years of them abandoning traditional values.) The southern kingdom of Judah later fell to Babylon in 597BC.", "label": 1}

The fact that that stopped the court from legislating from the bench--which is a good thing--and that it resulted in overturning a bad decision are simply the side effect of having 3 appointments in a 4 year term. Which, I believe, is unprecedented.\n\nWe'll put you down as having no understanding why the constitution was written the way it was.

You'll probably enjoy living in a one-party rule as long as you like what they tell you to do.\n\n> \u201cLeaving it to the states\u201d is a guarantee that deep red states will not only move to ban abortions and women\u2019s reproductive health care but also try and prosecute anyone who aids the women who travel to get one.\n\nIf that's the way a deep red state wants it, then that's the way it should be. Don't like it? Then move, convince your legislators otherwise, or run for office yourself.

Voting her in office shows me that people are so stupid and up their own asses they would literally vote a rabid squirrel into office just to be a contrarian. And the dumbest thing you claim to be worried about is that we'll lose democracy in this country if he gets in office even though:\n\u25cfshe bypassed the democratic selection to be the democrats' nominee \n\u25cf it didn't happen the first time Trump was in office\n\u25cfany bill such as project 2025, which he clarified he is NOT associated with, would have to be voted on and it's very clear it would not pass a vote\n\u25cfthe entire country, even the vast majority of right wing supporters would rise up against any type of dictatorship\n\u25cfTrump is 78 and the way he eats and lives it's  extremely doubtful he'll live to be 90 or 100 so how long would he even have to rule if this absurd scenario were to occur?\n\u25cfhe's already received 2 assassination attempts this year alone and more in the past I doubt that more people wouldn't try in the future.\n\nUltimately, no one has made a single good argument for the horse faced ho to be in office especially when her track record in California was trash. Literally the worst possible candidate for a woman president, the worst possible candidate for a Democrat president, and the worse possible candidate for a poc candidate and btw as someone with Indian heritage myself the ethnicity of your candidate should not matter- period. I'm gay too and if the only gay candidate was some ditzy coke head spouting off random nonsense I would vote for a straight person over the gay candidate. We don't need for every 4 years to try to check off diversity boxes we need someone with a damn brain so we don't need our first dementia patient president to be replaced by a crack whore president just like I would never vote for a ghetto bitch candidate like Jasmine Crockett because she would never be able to make the emotionless diplomatic sacrifices necessary for the good of the country. Jasmine Crockett demonstrated she is trashy, ghetto, and not in control of her temper.  But anyway, I was all for Joe Biden in 2020 until he picked kamala harris for VP because it was at that point I could see what horrible decision making skills he has.

Alexander also used pieces of the rubble to chuck it at new Tyre.

It is complete desolation minus the ash layer once you dig down and begin finding thousands of sulfur balls that indicate volcanic activity despite there being none in the area. Below the ash layer are signs of a civilization that was burned by intense heat and utterly destroyed. \n\n-the 300+ Amarna letters in ancient Egypt confirm that Israel did indeed destroy a great number of Canaanite kingdoms just as the OT describes it.\n\n-the Han Dynasty Star Charts discovered in Ancient China less than 10 years ago prove that the impossibly long, 3 hour eclipse described in the book of Mark when Jesus died ACTUALLY occurred on the SAME day biblical scholars estimate Jesus was crucified.

You people on Reddit and social media who understand nothing about law are quick to condemn potentially innocent people because your intellect isn\u2019t high enough to use logic and reasoning. \n\nYou seem to erroneously conflate a case being dropped due to a death threat with guilt. A case being dropped does not mean a person is guilty or innocent. It means the case was dropped. See, that person who accused Trump could have just as easily been of the metal defect that the person who was casting the death threats toward them was. Whenever you have a high profile individual in a case you have the capture of all types of people on the outside. In other words there are crazy people for Trump (as evidenced by death threats), and crazy people against Trump (as evidenced by an assassination attempt). It is entirely possible for humans who are mentally deficient to come forward with completely fabricated allegations. \n\nThe unfortunate part is that society (like yourself), does not care whether the allegations are based on reality or not. You will go so far as to find parallels to the alleged behavior and condemn them on parallels alone. \n\nYou do not care about facts. \n\nI on the other hand do care about facts. It is possible he did this, and it is possible he did not do this.

I woke the fuck up after Obama\u2018s second term and I totally agree. Fox News is bullshit. MSNBC is shit Every single mainstream media outlet is fucking complicit and bullshit and the only way to get anything close to resembling the truth is to go outside of the mainstream media\u2026 See the problem with the left is and I have plenty of experience with this is that you only listen to left-leaning outlets when you\u2019re on the right or in the center, you have no choice but to listen to both sides, and when you listen to both sides and listen to everything, there is a clear cut answer .. I choose to be on the side that\u2019s bringing people together. Everybody like ex hard-core Democrats. Let\u2019s just talk about Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F Kennedy, Vivek. Etc! You\u2019re too enclosed in your own bubble to see the facts and the news you listen to is at best half truths and omissions, and at worse straight out lies and if you actually looked at anything with any type of discerning sense you would be able to easily see that\u2026 Once again will be pointing and laughing at you while you\u2019re screaming up at the sky and crying like a little bitch\u2026 good luck you\u2019ll need \u2026 oh, and I\u2019ll put this challenge out to you because my vote is always for grabs\u2026 tell me one reason why I should vote for Kamala without saying, the word, woman, woman of color, Trump, Nazi, JD Vance, or abortion if you can convince me to vote for her without saying any of those words you have my vote right now\u2026 problem is she has no policy\u2019s what so ever. She has no intelligence. Nobody would fucking hire her to run a 7-Eleven in the private sector. If you were being honest with yourself, you know that\u2019s fact. You\u2019re OK electing the same government that\u2019s been in power for the last 40 years whether it\u2019s Democrats or Republicans were in a two-party dictatorship and you choose to vote for the side that\u2019s been selling our country out for the past four decades I really don\u2019t know how you look at yourselves in the mirror but at the same time I do watch CNN and MSNBC so I understand how completely fucking brainwashed you people are.", "label": 1}

Modern politics was invented so people can't \"hang the king\" anymore and for the sole purpose of \"divide et impera\". Politicians are part of a higher class that protects itself no matter what, they are friends with eachother more than they'll ever be friends with the plebs.  USA is ruled by the military industrial complex, Big Oil, insurance companies and investment funds, no policy affecting these industries will ever change based on the ruling party and no real change will come without affecting these industries. While both parties debate on the Ukraine or Palestine conflict, Lockheed stocks go brrrr and they will continue to do so regardless of who wins  the election.

Most are rapists and murderers. 30k+ total right now to be exact.. She wants open borders. She wants higher taxes along with an unrealized gains tax. She has no policy for inflation. No policy for government over spending. No policy on war. Has denied the invitation to go on Rogan for 3 hours which everyone knows she could never do. Has refused to any formal interview for almost 2 months after the coup of Biden. She can't free think. She has to read off a prompt. And if the interview isn't going her way, she gets flustered and argumentative.\n\nSo why did Netanyahu not want to meet with Harris after she avoided his speech in DC? Why did he meet with Trump instead? Trump had ZERO new wars. Why would Trump meet with Netanyahu if he's fascist? Y'all throw that word around so much trying your best to desensitize the word. What a vile thing to call someone that literally has a standing ground with peace in the middle east. Trump literally had a treaty imposed to Israel and Sudan.\n\nTrump shut down Russias European pipeline (Nord Stream) only for Biden to shut down Keystone XL on day one and re-open Nord Stream for Russia. So who is for Russia again? Do you not remember Trump calling Kim little rocket man after a heated conversation? And then had peace talks with Kim when Obama couldn't at all.. Obama said north Korea was America's biggest threat and Trump made that situation into peace.\n\nI work with a mix of ethnic backgrounds. All are voting for Trump.

There is a war in Ukraine that could tilt in Russia's favor and spread into other countries in Eastern Europe with Trump in office again. Trump cost thousands of lives during the pandemic. We have women dying in parking lots daily because of the abortion ban. It's illegal for doctors to take care of their patients if they need an abortion from ectopic pregnancies that are life threatening. The incompetence fed by his narcissistic egoism will surely kill thousands of people more from things yet to be imagined. \n\nProject 2025 will tear the United States apart and disband agencies that study weather and climate change that could save thousands if not millions of people in the future. Project 2025 will also take money from agencies that deal with disaster relief. \n\nElections aren't just about papers being counted. There are always consequences. Now more than ever there are always millions of lives at stake. Trump is threatening mass deportations and using pure nazi rhetoric. \n\nThis flood is sudden and tragic. It's sad. It's horrible. \n\nBut for your to dismiss the consequences of the loss of democracy and America being taken over by a dictator with the help of a bunch of deranged oligarchs shows you don't know what is at stake for the world if Trump wins.", "label": 1}

They don\u2019t want us to be in competition with big companies who pay millions to lobbyists to get laws to favor them.  \n\nTrump is kinda like a modern day Robin Hood but better.  Hood stole from the rich to give to the poor and the poor loved him.  The rich hated him.  This is not a good thing as poor people do not create jobs\n\nTrump instead is providing opportunities for the poor to become rich.  For the people to become independent and get off social services.
