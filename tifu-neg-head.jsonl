{"text": "Oh I may have miscommunicated or just left it out but when she\u2019s in certain states I can\u2019t get a word in sideways. \n\nI spent years of the relationship trying to talk and being interrupted what feels like 3 words into each sentence. I come from a background where it\u2019s not okay to interrupt, and there is a cultural difference in that apparent just from the states we grew up in. When someone is talking to me, my brain shuts down and I can\u2019t think about what I\u2019m saying and I automatically just listen. Part of that might be me being neurodivergent, part of that might be just how my family was growing up. \n\nWhen I moved to her area, it made more sense in a big city people are more okay with talking over each other. \u201cQuiet mouths don\u2019t get fed,\u201d someone said to me at one point. Kind of like that I guess. When I met her family, they interrupted me too. When I watched how she communicated with them, I observed how they interrupted each other, and it was just how they showed they had something they needed to say. They all would do this and get a little louder and louder and then quiet down. They would constantly tell me I\u2019m too quiet and her mother sometimes said I made her uncomfortable because I was \u201ctoo polite\u201d and quiet. One thing gf said she like about me in contrast to her mom is that, in her words, \u201cmy mom doesn\u2019t know when to shut up and can talk forever.\u201d Simultaneously, gf said, her mom doesn\u2019t like it when people talk her ear off, so even if she complained, it\u2019s better that I\u2019m quiet than a constant talker. \n\nAnyway, I had to work on this. Therapy told me to. If I\u2019m not being heard and I\u2019m not speaking up, then I\u2019m not doing my part. If it\u2019s her communication style, and she can\u2019t change it at my request, (I asked her nicely many many many times to try to not interrupt as much, I get that it happens sometimes and I accidentally interrupt but the difference is I avoided it and cared when I did it), and it was evident it was something she both didn\u2019t feel necessary to change and felt she couldn\u2019t help it. She actually did put a lot of effort into correcting it, and it used to be worse but it didn\u2019t change a huge amount. I appreciated the effort and no matter the difficulties that came from it it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to make me fall out of love with her. 1/2\n\nIt just got to the point that in order to be heard I had to speak up at times. And in some situations where we were both angry, we both yelled. I left this part out in the post above, she recorded me, beginning one hour before the cops were called. I left this part out because I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s technically illegal to do this in Chicago. She revealed this and played back the recording to me to prove how scary I was being, I believe she thought I was being scary, that isn\u2019t debatable, but when she played it back, all that was heard was me speaking clearly, deliberately, slowly, her quickly interrupting me and trying to say a lot while I was talking when it was my turn. Her sort of half listening to me and distorting what I was meaning and raising her voice, me raising my voice as well, and whenever I had the opportunity, I lowered my voice back to a gentle volume. \n\nIt\u2019s more that she had a habit of pushing me out of my turn in the conversation. I tried to get her to stop for a very long time but after miscommunications took root as just straight up beliefs for her, I neeeded to make sure I was being clear so she didn\u2019t think I was doing or thinking something that she assumed was harmful. This is something people with ptsd can do. And as for the use of the word trigger, it\u2019s not being used pejoratively. That\u2019s correct terminology my therapist used. They advised me how to conduct myself with her and they told me what would be hard about it. They told me where the line was and told me what could happen if I crossed it. \n1/2", "label": 0}

{"text": "\nWhen she played back this recording, she skipped over every point I was talking normally, making sense, or when it was clear she misheard or misunderstood something that was said quite clearly. There were points indeed where I was getting loud, but I ended up quieting down. When she raised her voice, she would sustain it, talk faster and faster, and it felt more like she just wanted to talk and not hear me talk. The key difference is my tone was clearly under control. And this is how i conducted myself after being advised by a therapist, this is my strategy for the past 2 and a half years, and it healed us quite a bit. Only now has she felt it was too much to handle, and you know what? I think that\u2019s okay. Her saying me yelling scared her? That\u2019s valid. I told her that. I apologized for that. But that doesn\u2019t mean I did something she didn\u2019t do. It doesn\u2019t mean I did something wrong or unfair. It means I\u2019m willing to change my strategy, to see her and adapt to her. And honestly it\u2019s easier for me to let her interrupt me. I had to try hard to get to a point where I would not be muscled out of the conversation. \n\nI know full well what triggered her in the past, what triggers her now. And sometimes that changes. And I\u2019m receptive to that change. I said TIFU because the delicate life I had fell apart when I triggered her. I think your misunderstanding is that every time someone gets triggered, it\u2019s the person who triggered them\u2019s fault. It can be, but intentions, actions, and effects all matter. You seem to be inclined to think I was shutting her out of the conversation. Contrarily, it feels I have to sprint when speaking to her just to keep up with what is normal to her. Anger isn\u2019t a vice, it isn\u2019t a problem. It is like a sense. All emotions are. They tell us something about what\u2019s happening, and sometimes they are wrong, but usually they have a good point. I think usually we can\u2019t act on our emotions because they don\u2019t tell us everything. But they usually tell us something. The problem happens when you try to cure anger like a disease. When you think \u201cI\u2019m angry and that\u2019s bad.\u201d So you start to do things that make it go away. There are healthy ways to do that, but most of the behaviors we attribute to anger are destructive. And many conflate those behaviors with anger itself. \n\nI stay a body length at least away from her. I don\u2019t get in her face. I often turn away from her, at least so I\u2019m facing perpendicular to her. I\u2019ll squat down so I\u2019m not standing over her, or even so she\u2019s standing over me. (Not groveling or on my knees.) I often put my hands in my pockets, but sometimes show them so she knows I don\u2019t have anything. I\u2019m aware how I can appear threatening to her. I don\u2019t want to be, and how she sees me from moment to moment isn\u2019t necessarily evidence of what I actually am. Crucially actually, it\u2019s important to know when triggered she often (not always) doesn\u2019t see me correctly. She\u2019s told me she\u2019s seen my face morphing or like she sees the image of someone else instead of my face at her worst moments. On a rare couple occasions she argued with me like I\u2019m someone else, saying I do things that I never have and never will. This is part of ptsd. It seems kind of far fetched and maybe her words are exaggerated, but I think the effect of what she\u2019s experiencing and her meaning are not exaggerated. \n\nAnyway, this is way deeper, delicate, and more nuanced than \u201cI don\u2019t know to argue. I shouldn\u2019t talk over someone.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t and don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m raising my voice, actually I think I said in the post, in response to being talked over to begin with, not to talk over her. I listen to her, i say back to her what I understand she said. I use active listening techniques. I only raise my voice To match hers when she does this, to show that it\u2019s not going to push me out of the conversation. (Recall me speaking about boundaries. Being pushed out  of a conversation is a boundary. You must advocate and set your boundaries clearly and that can involve elevated vocal volume.) I spent the argument essentially trying to reiterate how I wanted to be understood when I was going to disengage from the discussion. She broods on what I say or what she thinks I said if I walk away, and then she comes back and argues with me about 100 assumptions she made while I was trying to cool off and let her do the same. \n\nThe key about the recording is, she began recording when neither of us were yelling, it was an hour long, it ended when I was at my loudest, at the point she said I scared her. She did not show it to the police I believe for two reasons: it showed I wasn\u2019t actually a threat, and because she wasn\u2019t technically legally supposed to do that. I didn\u2019t feel betrayed by it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that wrong of a thing to do, and I was eager to hear the conversation. I told her she could keep it, but she decided to delete it. \n\nI\u2019m not sorry because I think yelling was a monstrous thing to do. I\u2019m sorry because it scared her. Just like I\u2019m sorry when I walk into a room and she didn\u2019t hear me coming and it makes her jump. I don\u2019t want her to feel bad. Apologies are free you know. They don\u2019t equate admitting to being a bad person. I validate she was scared. I validate she wants me to try a different strategy. I can say that and also say I didn\u2019t conduct myself incorrectly. It\u2019s a queue to shift communication strategies. And I said this to her as well. She knows this. She knows I\u2019ll adapt to her needs. Sometimes she just doesn\u2019t see me as I am. When I recognize she doesn\u2019t, I try to reset and try again later, but sometimes there\u2019s little pieces we can\u2019t leave broken or else the damage gets worse as we cool off. It was to the effect of \u201cI\u2019m not asking what the medication is or why you need it or forcing you to take it. I just want to pick it up for you and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t even need that. I am not a threat to you.\u201d The argument was basically me trying to say that for one hour, and her blaming me for ruining the day and getting in her business, and then me saying that I didn\u2019t ruin the day and this didn\u2019t even have to be an argument. Well, if it was neatly back and forth, that\u2019s what it would have been. Of course she has a side too. \n2/2", "label": 0}

I once walked in the upstairs front door bc I didn't have my keys for downstairs, look down the shotgun hallway to the back of the house, and see a crowd of people at the end with my friend in a rope tied around his waist, about to repel out the fucking window to the backyard where the back door was unlocked.

{"text": "Probably the last update for anyone still here:\n\nI made it home tonight at 10pm. It\u2019s been almost three days total on the road. It was a trip that could be made in a single day if you start early enough but. I\u2019m not doing good. Hard to eat - not hungry - had been throwing up. \n\nAs I went along the trip, my left headlight AND taillight went out. When the sun set, I pulled into a town and went to autowhatever and got what I needed. \n\nI worked on that for a good time because all my tools were under everything I had packed and it was packed in a way that was very difficult to have gotten it in in the first place. I got it done and put in some oil.  Then I drove for a long time. Then passed into a really cool city that happened to be a college town. It was late, decided to look for a hotel. College kids everywhere bar hopping. Some planning would have made reservation possible and it would have avoided the next ordeal. But I don\u2019t think reservations were realistic because I didn\u2019t know where I was gonna be when I needed to rest. And my car was packed to the brim. No recline.  Even Passenger seat stacked. I walk into the hotel they ask my name after I wait a bit, then they realize I didn\u2019t have a reservation and inform \u201cthere\u2019s a home game tonight, there\u2019s no vacancy for everywhere within 2 hours.\u201d\n\nBack in my car I consider options. It\u2019s already 2 am and I\u2019m tired. Consider going down to the bars to see if I can make some friends. Consider going to Walmart to get camping gear. Time is passing. Decide I should think while driving. Start driving. End up in the next city which was 2h away. Check the hotels there. No vacancy or can\u2019t check in at 4 am. I try sleeping in my front seat sitting straight up. Fall asleep for probably 1 minute a time, mouth drops open, jolts me awake feeling annoyed and mad at everything. No go. Hit the road. \n\nHop another state. It\u2019s 7am now. Find a days inn in a tiny town that looked similar to how I felt. They let me check in. \u201cCheckout is at 11 but we\u2019re so nice we let you leave at 12.\u201d Figure 5 hours is better than 0 hours. As I\u2019m paying, see sign that says \u201cif you have complaints about your room you must file them within 20 minutes or NO REFUNDS.\u201d I wonder why\u2026\n\nThen the price ends up being 80 fucking dollars. Ten dollars less than the hotel the night before, which was perfect. Not super fancy but clean and modern and with sensible facilities. And not with a smell of death. \n\nHe tells me there\u2019s a free breakfast that just started. He\u2019s a nice guy for now. I haven\u2019t eaten since I left the last hotel. I contemplate the breakfast but remember the sign. I walk into my room, smells like rotting meat. It\u2019s dark. Feel like I\u2019m gonna find a body. Turn on lights and they are eerily dim. You know when you use the public bus or train and there\u2019s the seat dirt? Everything in this room is covered in what looks like that. The bed which was once white is a grayish brown from this stuff. The one chair beside it has it accumulated all on the seat. Carpet is faded and dark from the stuff. I think for a bit. \n\nOnce I\u2019m back in the lobby I ring the guy again (he\u2019s probably a live-in manager, the front desk is not occupied but there\u2019s an old phone you pickup and some loud ringing plays. He answers it and says he\u2019s coming. So he shows up and sees it\u2019s me again and he isn\u2019t glad. Tell him \u201csorry I can\u2019t actually afford it, it turns out, and I need to request a refund.\u201d He gets pretty mad. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad nothing can be done it\u2019s too late.\u201d Not sure his angle here. What\u2019s a refund then?\n\nI point at the sign and say \u201cwell what about your policy? I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s too dirty.\u201d\n\nHe sighs and he\u2019s pissed. He takes out his smartphone and calls someone, and starts doing something on the computer. No one answers the phone and he continues doing something on the comp \n\n\u201cOk. It\u2019s reversed\u2026 but there is a 20 dollar charge for this.\u201d \n\nJust stare for a second. \u201cOK THANKS.\u201d\n\nWalk back to car, looking at bank statement for a charge to dispute. \n\nHead to Walmart. Buy fire stuff, some sausage links and skewers, a tarp and some stakes, a mallet, etc. like 50 buck. Why tarp and not tent? Figured I should get the cheapest stuff. Tent was the right choice here though in retrospect\u2026\n\nHead to the woods. (My dad gave me a military surplus extreme cold sleeping bag a long time ago and it\u2019s always been in my car so this was always the last resort. But maybe I\u2019m dumb for this one.) this point I\u2019m dizzy upon standing up, and standing for more than 30 seconds at a time. My legs feel weak. I keep forgetting what I\u2019m thinking.

Sleep about 2 hours like this. Wake up. Feel actually fully rested. I know I\u2019m still exhausted, but the feeling that I\u2019m gonna pass out at the wheel is gone. However, i feel completely paralyzed by my emotions. Feel horrendously sad and stressed. Feel like I took too much time to travel. Keep catching myself waiting to go back to our house. Thinking about my bed. My dog. (Her bed, her dog) cry. Chat with some of you guys. Gets me moving. As I\u2019m packing up, notice a weird little spider on my water bottle. Fuck. Snap a pic, iPhone says it\u2019s a tick. Of course. Thought it looked like one. I know there\u2019s ticks out here. What was I thinking. Where I\u2019m from there are no ticks. We don\u2019t think about bugs when it\u2019s cold. I tend to forget ticks don\u2019t care about the cold for a good while. I\u2019m wearing my last set of clean clothes.

Don\u2019t find any, but can\u2019t really check without a mirror. Will probably stop at a doctor at some point soon to see if I caught something and for a general health screen cause why not. Pack the couple things back in, drive back out. It\u2019s like 4pm now. Says I\u2019ll be there in 5 hours. Get to work on it. I swear, in the first hour, it said it got down to 4 hours and then started counting back up even though I didn\u2019t make a wrong turn or anything. Sun goes down. Keep going. Stop last time for gas. Feels like my legs are noodles and my knees hurt. Finally make it in. Get to pop\u2019s place. I had texted him to just leave a key out for me, didn\u2019t want to stop him sleeping, but he left it open for me and was waiting for me and hugged me and he\u2019s been just trying to accommodate whatever I\u2019m needing but I\u2019m not asking. Consider seeing friend that yelled in voice chat that scared gf the other day. (He lives here) \n\nGo for a shower. Dad didn\u2019t have much to eat in the fridge which is totally okay he\u2019s a busy retired guy(retired but freelances as a carpenter), and he likes to sleep early so I didn\u2019t want to cook. I can\u2019t keep my mind on track, figure protein issue. I grab a slice of bread and butter it and put some random and weird things on it. Spinach and hemp seed. Actually it\u2019s fine. Not a thrill to eat but feel like a significant improvement. Get ready for bed. Write this so I feel a little better still. \n\nGonna focus on getting insurance. I\u2019ll start with some basic income from something. Surveys, maybe some gigwork thing, maybe I\u2019ll do plasma again. (Did this during covid) then I\u2019m thinking about getting a cdl license or maybe I can be like mad guy from days inn and be a live in employee at a hotel in a city I like more than my hometown which is pretty depressing to me.
