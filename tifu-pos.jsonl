{"text": "I wouldn't normally, but this should be said.  \n\nIn western society, we have become so blessed with understanding and freedoms that we are now finding ways to also have a negative connotation with almost everything and everyone.  Imagine simply saying that you don't like the color black.  Well, all of a sudden, you must be colorblind.  Or perhaps your dislike of the color black is because you live in a wealthy neighborhood where crime doesn't exist.  And so black becomes a talking point about the color of skin, and in one or two steps, you're now racist.\n\nI'll stop my rant there.  \nI understand asexualism, but just because we have given it a name, a platform, and a reason for being, does not mean that it is then either normal or needs to be given a bigger platform with further platitudes.  ... To further explain it to others as if we all don't know what they are saying...\n\nImagine me telling you that I have a brother that grew up obsessing over women, would point out beautiful women in magazines, etc, only for him to then say he is asexual.  I'm okay with that, but shouldn't we explore possibly treating that, rather than giving him straight up acceptance?  If it is outside the norm, we should explore whether there is an issue.  If they don't wish to, fine.  But then don't ask me to pretend that everything is fine.  \n\nI would still love that person as my brother, but would hope they would seek help.  That's all.  Acceptance by fiat is nonsensical to me.  \"I say, therefore, I am.\" At no point in time has this ever been acceptable in an \"end of all\" circumstance.  \n\nI'll end with this... I don't really know either person here.  I still think anyone with mental issues should at least seek help, but I wish them well if they don't want it.

People often have extraordinary spiritual revelations on hallucinogenics that go away over time because ultimately you can\u2019t shortcut a pathway to real enlightenment with a simple chemical reaction in your brain.
