{"text": "\"It can't get worse under Trump\" isn't a legitimate argument. There are plenty of very obvious ways it could get worse under Trump. For example, the bill that Biden signed in the spring with military assistance for Israel also included $1B in humanitarian aid for Gaza, and they've sent an additional $400M in July and $300M+ a few weeks ago. Is that going to counteract the fact that they're also arming Israel? No. But would more Palestinians be dying if they didn't do it? Yes. And it would be very simple for the Trump admin to not make that aid a priority while still continuing to arm Israel--at the same or higher rates.\n\nHarris also *has* been noticeably more moderate on Israel than Biden has. She hasn't \"endorsed the complete destruction of Gaza\"; she's said that Israel has a right to defend themselves but that the scale of suffering in Gaza is \"devastating,\" and that a ceasefire should happen so that \"the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self determination.\" What will that actually translate to once she's office?

He has taken advantage of an inherently racist system, while Black Americans have been abused by it. We are not the same,\u201d said the NAACP president and CEO, Derrick Johnson, in a statement.\n\nIn 2016, when Donald Trump first ran for president, just about every self-declared white nationalist, white supremacist, Klansman, neo-Nazi, and fascist in the country supported his candidacy. And that\u2019s no exaggeration.\n\nIn August 2017, within months of being in office, the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, produced a clear opportunity for Trump to denounce racists, Neo-Nazis, and Klansmen who\u00a0[marched](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/12/1116942725/the-charlottesville-rally-5-years-later-its-what-youre-still-trying-to-forget)\u00a0to the chants of \u201cWhite lives matter\u201c and \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Instead, unlike nearly every other elected official on the national scene, Democrat or Republican, he\u00a0[flubbed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/)\u00a0his response. After a press conference or two, where he equivocated and went off-script to wax admiringly about \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d he ultimately denounced the far-right racists. However, he pointedly agreed with their demand that generated the march in the first place\u2014their objection to the removal of the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park. Trump has decried the dismantling of Lee statues on a number of occasions, including in Charlottesville, where he\u00a0[called it](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/17/politics/trump-tweet-confederate-statues/index.html)\u00a0\u201csad\u201d and \u201cso foolish.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, after four years in office, he arguably received even stronger and more violent support from his far-right and white nationalist backers. Those years included his anti-(non-white-)immigrant fight to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d on the US-Mexican border, his rejection of immigrants from the \u201c[shithole countries](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-north-america-donald-trump-ap-top-news-international-news-fdda2ff0b877416c8ae1c1a77a3cc425)\u201d of the Global South, the aspersions he cast on Black-dominated cities, and his endless racist statements about Black\u00a0[athletes](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/black-athletes-should-never-stick-sports-again/617052/),\u00a0[elected officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/trump-elijah-cummings-baltimore.html),\u00a0[women](https://newsone.com/playlist/trump-attacking-black-women-timeline/), and\u00a0[protesters](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/trump-attacks-black-lives-matter-racial-justice-movement.html).\n\nThen, of course, during the 2020 election campaign, far-right extremist groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys, and others\u2014many with openly racist members in their ranks\u2014rallied around Trump and became his frontline soldiers after he lost.

{"text": "A few things:  \n  \nThe great majority of those top-performing schools existed before the universal voucher program was implemented in 2022. This success was built within the public system, particularly through Arizona's robust charter school program which maintained public oversight and accountability. Something some of these private schools do not.\n\nSecond, there's a critical self-selection bias in early voucher data. The families most likely to take advantage of vouchers right away are often those with the resources, time, and knowledge to navigate educational choices. Essentially cream-skimming from the public system. This creates a veneer of success while potentially leaving behind our most vulnerable students due to their parents not having said resources, time, or knowledge.\n\nThe $600 million in savings claim needs serious scrutiny, I'd like to see a source. Whatever the number might be, it wouldn't account for the fixed costs that public schools must maintain even with fewer students (buildings, staff, special education services), nor would it factor in the long-term costs of reduced oversight. When public funds flow to private institutions without proper accountability measures, we've seen troubling patterns of misuse in other states, I do not think Arizona is special in that regard.\n\nLastly and probably most importantly, education isn't **just** about individual consumer choice. It's about creating an educated citizenry and ensuring equal opportunity for all children. Private schools can refuse students with special needs or behavioral challenges, while public schools serve everyone by definition. This sorting mechanism can exacerbate existing inequalities under the guise of \"choice.\"", "label": 0}

And if it's not, he's straight up saying that anyone who's not white is spoiling the gene pool of the country.\n\nThis is not the first, but just one of many times he's talked about \"good genes\" or \"bad genes\" at his rallies. I can add sources for that too if you want, but I think my point is made.\n\nThe other thing that looks really bad is his agreement on Fox and Friends that he would defund schools that didn't teach the way he wanted. This came immediately after one of the hosts suggested the \"alternative, new history\" that these schools might warrant defunding for was literally just teaching that \"America was built on the back of stolen land and slaves.\"", "label": 0}

Other protest votes are counterbalancing it - especially Roe, which cannot be understated in its magnitude. The Gaza issue is overstated for two reasons in my analysis:\n\n1. Arab Americans make up a relatively tiny portion of the US population. Just over 1% (the Jewish population is about twice that.) Most of them live in solid blue states like CA and NY. Even Michigan, with its \"huge Arab American population\" is only 2% Arab American. It has a larger than typical Arab American population *for the Midwest*, but still has fewer Arab Americans than NY or CA - both in total *and proporitonally.*\n\n2.

So let's start there. \n\nTrump inherited both falling unemployment and falling budget deficits (see CBO's January 2017 projection of $560 billion). He quickly reversed the trend in budget deficits, increasing it to about $1 trillion pre-pandemic, putting us in a much worse fiscal situation going into it before the pandemic surge. Over half the current budget deficit is interest on past debt and Trump has some of his fingerprints on that. \n\nReal GDP growth never hit 3% annually, topping out at 2.9% in 2018, matching 2015's GDP growth.\n\nUnemployment fell slightly during his first 3 years, a little over a percent but that's not that remarkable given it was low to begin with. It actually bottomed out slightly lower under Biden but little mention of that in the media at the time. There was less job growth Trump's first 3 years vs Obama's last 3.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS)\n\nSo the economy through 2019 was ok, not great, and yes it was inherited.

Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies concluded people with specific individuals tied to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee (D.N.C.) and additional sources such as John Podesta, campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the Republican National Committee (R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C.\u2014and chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.

That face that says: \u201coh shoot, this actually somehow worked out\u201d. He had talked a lot, but he hadn\u2019t truly planned or delineated anything of what he had promised. He didn\u2019t have the support he has now in every branch of the government including federal and Supreme Court. This time around his entire cabinet will also be made up of people who think and agree with his views. People who won\u2019t oppose or try to moderate him. He also has a vice president whom he hand picked and who will clearly follow line with any \u201cradical\u201d decisions he may come up with. \n\nThis is not the same Trump from four years ago. He happened to find a base of people who felt represented by the \u201cmillionaire\u201d who \u201cknows the system\u201d and who happens to represent the true American \u201cheritage\u201d by being a \u201csuccessful Christian man who loves 1980\u2019s tradition\u201d. Someone \u201cwho tells it like it is\u201d. Someone who uses language people can understand. Someone who places women in the kitchen and tending to the kids \u201cas they normally should\u201d. Someone who will put gays and lesbians \u201cback in the closet\u201d.\n\nThese people are extremely enabled by what he represents. I can feel it being an immigrant who lives in rural white america.

When's the last time any of them endorse the Republican for president? It's at the point where their endorsement doesn't actually matter. The people who read them already know who the newspapers want to win, and the people who read them already know who they themselves want to win. No one's changing their mind because Washington Post endorsed somebody, not unless that endorsement was a major surprise, and encouraged curiosity.  So I can see why someone with an interest in the business would want to avoid unnecessarily identifying themselves as liberal, to draw a wider audience.\n\nOf course, by declining to endorse someone, that's almost certainly going to inspire in someone the *wrong* kind of curiosity, even as WaPo's editor makes a very lame attempt to argue that no one should read into it. Will it inspire this wrongheaded curiosity to a significant degree? I honestly don't know. I'm inclined to say probably not, but giving how close the election is, maybe it will. \n\nRegardless, we know the reason I just outlined is not the reason Jeff Bezos is thinking. Amazon makes an insane amount of money from AWS, their cloud service, and they have contracts with the government. Trump is obviously going to retaliate against those contracts, should he come to power. With the polls being tied, Bezos is hedging his bets.  This is an act of cowardice, pure and simple. There is no business sense for the newspaper itself. It's just business sense for Bezos himself. \n\nIf Trump loses, Bezos will skirt any real responsibility.

A student may not have a driver's license, may not need a drivers license, and is a lot less likely to obtain a state ID card if they only plan to be there while at school.\n\nIf a state were to choose which voter ID they allow to be used do you think it's possible they can *target* demographics based on those laws?\n\nCan that be used to cause voter suppression?  At least *theoretically*?  Do you recognize that there is a *potential* for abuse?", "label": 0}

With all the equipment and man power law enforcement have access to, this would have to be violence like we've never seen before.\n\nTo your point about the legal system, I think if Trump's repeated attempts in 2020 to use the judicial system to claw back the election has taught us anything it's that it is a loosing strategy. I don't think the fabric of the judicial system is changed enough since then for that to be a realistic play for either party.

On top of that polls now have like a 1% response rate. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think the polls are useless, I think they\u2019re probably good for getting the feel of things in general and I think all that they can tell us now is that it\u2019s somewhat close. In addition, the people who choose to answer polls are skewed towards Trump, which I don\u2019t think should be shocking information since they tend to be much older. I mean what 20 year old is answering a random phone call or text. I\u2019m 38 and the one text poll I started to do I stopped and blocked the number when I realized it was essentially a Trump campaign one.", "label": 0}

{"text": "According to Reuters Ipsos, Trump is leading with white women by 3 points but down from 12 in 2020.\n\n> *Trump\u2019s gains have been offset by increased support for Harris among white women, who favored him over Biden by 12 points late in 2020 but now lean Republican by 3 points, 46% to 43%. The two candidates are locked in an exceptionally tight race, with Harris up only marginally - 46% to 43% - in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 16-21.*\n\nWhere in the Pew Research article does it specifically say Biden was up with white women? From that same article:\n\n> *Just as was the case four years ago, there is a sizable gender gap in candidate preference: Women voters continue to favor the Democratic candidate for president by 17 percentage points (55% to 39%). This is roughly on par with 2016.*\n\n> *In contrast, men are divided. Today, 49% favor Biden while 45% favor Trump. In 2016, men favored Trump by modest margins in preelection polls, as well as among validated 2016 voters.*\n\n> *There are also sizable gaps by race and ethnicity. White voters prefer Trump to Biden (51% vs. 44%, respectively), though Biden is faring slightly better among White voters in the current race relative to Hillary Clinton in 2016.*\n\nIt shows women preferred Biden, but white voters overall favored Trump. Trump did win a majority of white women in 2020, 53% vs 44% but Biden won the overall majority of women 55% vs 44%. [Source Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/)\n\nSo white women favored Trump prior to 2020 by 12 points, final election results had him win them by 9 points (within margin of error +/- 3). White women now only favor Trump by 3 points. And Democrats have won majority of women in 2016 and 2020.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Came to say this. The problem with the polls isn\u2019t the answer, it\u2019s the mapping they\u2019ve chosen on how those answers line up with Likely Voters. If you were to project those same answers into all Registered Voters, it would be Harris by miles. \n\nSo what\u2019s the difference? It will have to be first time and infrequent votes, and while there\u2019s no hard evidence, anecdotally as you say college students are putting the effort into voting in their home towns, finding their polling location, getting it done early - something traditionally the 18-34 crowd is terrible at, often being a day late and a dollar short on finding time and knowing how to vote. \n\nI think the voting totals might show the highest percentage of Registered Voters ever. \n\nApparently there were 161 million in 2022 but 168 in 2020. A whopping 158million/168m of 2020 voted,  for contrast in Hillary\u2019s election, suppressed enthusiasm led to only 137m/158m (86.7%) voted, about 21m registered-but-not-voting (RBNV) sat out, while last time to throw Trump out only 10milion voters were RBNV. (94% of registered voted)\n\n\nSo if this years registrations go up past 2020 - and this does seem likely, with the way both sides are scrambling their friends to register, we could see, let\u2019s say maybe 96% of registered vote AND the total registered goes up to 175m - that would be about 7 million sitting out but 168m votes cast, ie about exactly 7m more voters. I think that tilts a lot of states real high, and swing states about a solid 51.5/48.5.\n\nLet\u2019s hope!\n\nSource: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/voter-turnout-in-presidential-elections", "label": 0}

{"text": "I am deeply skeptical about the public polling right now. \n\nFirst, because the polls are essentially tied-- Again and again, we see Harris and Trump within a couple of points of each other in most of the swing states. We usually consider those polls to have a 3-5% margin of error; if the polls are tied, that margin of error could translate into a blue wave. \n\nIt's also strange that the polls are consistently SO close. It stinks of pollsters overcorrecting and trying to avoid breaking out of the pack, not following the data wherever it leads. \n\nSecond, in American political polling, pollsters are very good at fighting the last war-- they look at all the mistakes they made in the last cycle and try to fix them this time. \n\n2020 was NOT a normal election. The pandemic changed everything. People were at home all the time and much happier to talk on the phone than usual, and the patterns of who voted on election day, early, and by mail were completely different than prior elections. So I think the polling lessons of 2020 have limited applicability in 2024. \n\nThird, we have several prominent Democratic insiders telling us that the public polls are garbage. In 2024, we have a lot fewer high-quality public polls than we've had in the past-- they're expensive, and media budgets have shrunk. But we have lots of cheap garbage polls, good enough to feed the 24 hour news cycle, but not good enough to give us a sold picture of the race. \n\nThe parties and campaigns do extensive private polling that's not released to the public. The details of those are usually protected by NDAs, but we've had a few Democratic operatives come out and say, vehemently, that we shouldn't trust the public polls. \n\nDavid Plouffe has been the most vocal about this:\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4932146-david-plouffe-polling-kamala-harris/\n\nSo yes, I think a Blue Wave is possible.", "label": 0}
