The old pool was nearing the end of its life span and was due to be replaced anyways, and the money we raised could help support the program. In fact, in the interim, we even secured $8.5 million from two anonymous donors but MSU didn't accept it because they were estate bequests and endowments rather than \"cash in hand.\"\n\nThen, MSU says that in order to \"upgrade\" the pool to support a competitive varsity program (which keep in mind is already going to be build as part of a $200 million dollar rec center) we'd have to raise more money to make the upgrades.\n\nThe cost? **$26.5 million dollars**. That's enough money to support a program like MSU's for 30+ years. And the pool is being built anyways! We knew it was a bullshit number to kill our efforts, but we knew it would be insurmountable. \n\n  \n*Sigh*. Point being, unless you're a top top program the people in charge don't care about sports like ours, and with the way NIL keeps going they're only going to get more giddy to cut programs.

Instead, what you got was athletic departments who have no incentive to do anything but spend every cent they get, regardless of if it made sense or not. AD salaries keep going up (CDC at Texas is making almost $3M/yr), coaching salaries and buyouts are out of control, facilities got absolutely ridiculous, and why not? You have plenty of TV revenue and donors are backing up the Brinks truck. Why not spend $22M on a lacrosse-only stadium for a lacrosse team that isn't even competitive in conference play?

{"text": "I mean, c'mon, that's not how any of this works. They have x amount of money to operate on, short of an unexpected donation from a booster. That amount of money either is enough to buy out Neal and his staff *and* pay a competitive salary to a new coach and his staff. Obviously that's not all necessarily paid in one lump sum overall, but the school has to obviously be able to may the payments as legally agreed upon in any contract. \n\nAgain, unless someone is ponying up an unexpected donation (and it's not **entirely** out of the equation, though unlikely) whether we lose the money later or not makes little difference if the money simply isn't there. \n\nOutside of that, if the Mountaineers made an exciting hire, the fans will come back until it that candidate either goes elsewhere or fails. WVU and Marshall sports are what West Virginia, as a state, has. That, and pretty scenery. There is little else and there will *always* be a strong home market if the team is at all competitive.\n\nThe buyout is going to be much easier to swallow after next season. We are, unfortunately, probably stuck with him through then. Hoppy Kercheval and Mike Cassazza are both reporting the same, and they're WVU's most plugged in reporters.", "label": 0}
