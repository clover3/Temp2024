{"text": "Long rant because I have a lot to say. \n\nIn my honest opinion, 6v6 will not save the game. It will solve a few issues, and bring a whole bunch of it's own. It will feel fresh for a little while because it's a major shake-up, just like how 5v5 was at first, and eventually people will workshop their way right back to complaining about the exact same things over and over again.\n\nThe number one issue with 6v6 has and always will be queue times. Even if they won't admit it, queue times (DPS queue times in particular), were likely the number one reason they decided to move to 5v5 in the first place. We see them trying to address this by trying out Min 1 Max 3, but frankly I doubt we're gonna get anything but 2-2-2 role queue if 6v6 ever does come back as the primary format. 5-10 minute DPS queues for Quick Play will undoubtedly kill the casual playerbase far faster than current 5v5 will. This is an unavoidable roadblock with going back to 6v6 and if they can't solve it, then I don't see it being viable as the primary format for very long.\n\nThe next thing is the issue of Tank being fun. This has been a hot debate for a while, with people saying that going back to 6v6 will make Tank fun again. This is history revisionism, Tank has never been a popular role regardless of format and adding a second one to each team will not change that. In order to maintain current queue times the Tank population is going to need to at least double, which will not happen in the long-term unless Tanks are so strong that they completely run the game and every other role suffers for it. Tank has always been a thankless, niche role and likely will remain as one unless they're so broken they make the game worse for everyone else. There are some upsides to Tanking in 6v6, such as reduced counterswapping and a second Tank carrying part of the burden and pressure, but there are also several issues like Tank synergy being so important that a bad one can cause an instant loss, moreso than a bad Support or DPS synergy, and having to be reliant on your second tank in order to make plays. I'd also bet money that if they go through with reduced CC like they claim, they're eventually gonna end up slowly re-adding it in later anyways because of how strong 2 tanks at once are. I wouldn't be surprised if 6 months into the 6v6 resurgence we see hard stun on Brig Bash and Flashbang return, or Mei Freeze, longer Sleep Dart, etc.. 2 Tanks working together is so powerful the only solutions to keep the other 2 roles bearable are to either reintroduce these hard CC abilities in order to give squishies actual counterplay, or to nerf the tanks so heavily they don't feel like they have any impact at all and the role still remains unfun.\n\nNext is the issue of all of the heroes designed for 5v5. We're up to 9 heroes released and balanced during the 5v5 format now, alongisde a bunch of hero reworks and heroes in development. That's a lot of work that needs to be done to re-adjust all these heroes for 6v6, and some need it way more than others. This could lead to several heroes becoming obsolete or having to lose their identity to maintain balance. Junker Queen will likely be under 400 HP and have much weaker abilities which will make her far less fun to play. Same with Ramattra, same with Mauga, same with even OW1 heroes like Orisa and Hog who've received so many changes to their gameplay. A lot of people are going to get bummed out that their main doesn't play the same as before and isn't as fun. And that's just on the Tank side, a ton of heroes in the other roles will need major changes too and it could end up polarizing a lot of people like the initial switch to 5v5 did.\n\nI don't wanna sound like a doomer but I genuinely don't think 6v6 changes the game as much as people want it too, nor will it solve all or even most of the games problems. If 6v6 does become permanent, I guarantee within 3 months we'll be seeing people complaining about the exact same things that they do right now.", "label": 0}

But trying to simply apply that to OW2 as it stands today will not yield the same results and will cause numerous headaches for the game and its development, including costing a lot of time for the devs to try and make work.\n\nI realize people don't like to think about those behind-the-curtains aspects, but they do exist.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This is an interesting point. I agree with everything you say but will add that they also do partner with various big name publishers and developers to get more \u201caccurate\u201d result as well as using third part reports and databases. When you go down to lesser known games then for sure.\n \n I work for a top 10 games publisher and it\u2019s our go to source for market data and reports. For our own titles we can definitely get more accurate hour by hour results directly from the distribution platforms and market places but for an overall market performance and summary we look at newzoo in our monthly reports and market research etc. it\u2019s the most easily accessible and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d report on the market itself. \n \n Now granted no business decisions will be made off newzoo numbers and anything like that will require deeper  more target and accurate research. However getting accurate data in general is tricky and doing that for the whole market it very difficult. Newzoo provides data which is deemed \u201caccurate enough\u201d by many AAA publisher that i think to immediately dismiss the data is unfair. unless you connect to dozens of other sources and start paying their insane subscription fees too then newzoo does the job. \n\nAlso worth having worked with newzoo data Monthly active users is a terrible metric to go by it literally just measures the number of people who have launched the game.

{"text": "Tank, Doomfist:\n\nIf you like Freedom, Doom is a good pick. His ability to traverse the map quickly gives you a lot of freedom in terms of how you want to approach an area/battle/enemy. Mastering the ability of getting in and out of fights quickly is the key to your (and your team's) survival. If you don't like giving your opponents a lot of time to breathe, Doom is a good option for that as he is very nimble and can close the distance fast, so enemies need to always be prepared for a Doom dive and aren't allowed to let their guard down. You also have amazing voice lines :)\n\nDps, Pharah:\n\nIf you are looking for more verticality in your game, and want to be a threat from above, Pharah is excellent for it. Echo is obviously there as well, but she is a bit different. Echo excels more in the 1v1 department and has more utility because of her ult, but Pharah has generally better damage and is more of a zoner and that can control areas/chokes/groups better. So if you want the latter, pick Pharah. The ult (if used correctly) can also kill any hero you want because of the strong burst damage.\nPlus if you are a fan of Bazookas/Rocket Launchers in shooters, then Pharah is your girl!\n\nSupport, Moira:\n\nIf you want a mobile and elusive Support hero, Moira is a good pick. Her fade ability is a great tool not only for traversing the map quickly or reaching certain spots, it is also a great tool for defensive purposes (to get away from pressure), and for offensive purposes (chasing targets that try to retreat). While she doesn't have the utility other support characters have, she instead has the ability to be a very strong offensive tool that can dish out a lot of damage while also healing a lot and supporting her team. She is very flexible in that regard, so you can play her more offensively or more defensively based on what your team needs right now. Some other supports can do this too, but Moira doesn't require nearly as much execution as she is more simple to play.", "label": 0}

While it is true that ball can basically guarantee one of her bubbles gets her 40 charge, the real strength behind her bubble is to stop someone from dying when making a risky play.  Something ball does not need since OW2 really dialed back hard CC.\n\nOther than bubbling his slam, these two tanks do not synergize well.  One wants to dive and then disengage, the other wants to stick around and brawl.  Zarya in a 6v6 formal absolutely does *not* want to the only tank on the frontline.  She doesn't have the sustain or damage output to pressure or survive two tanks focusing her.  What she wants to do is allow her other tank to create the space and she keeps it.  \n\nIt's why, while not always meta, Rein has been a consistently great duo pick.  She allows him to charge in the middle of the enemy team and swing his hammer dealing unblockable cleaving damage while she can stand behind him and picking someone off one by one.\n\nBut a Zarya/Ball duo is just asking the enemy to bumrush her team and out-brawl them since Ball can't really help  with his low damage output towards tanks.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Step one that really unlocked brig for me was to stop viewing her as a pseudo-tank. You're right that she is very vulnerable when swinging, so you have to play somewhat safe. You also want to keep your shield bash available to bash away as an escape option. This was a big change for me since it's tempting to bash into the enemy both for damage and getting inspire, but then you are stuck with no way out if you're in trouble.\n\nThe second big thing is simple, you just need to hit a decent percentage of your whip shots. They do a lot of damage and more importantly get your inspire going while you stay safe. In general you should use it on cooldown, of course there are exceptions, but it's a good rule of thumb.\n\nYou can use your packs a lot to help people who may not be getting your inspire healing. They've buffed the packs a lot over the last year or two so they are pretty good for this.\n\nOnce you are in the default state of being safe though, you need to re-learn when you can hit the gas. It's amazing as a brig when the enemy is on the backfoot because you can just start swinging, dive their healers, do whatever while healing a ton. Especially if you have Rally, you can make some big plays by stunning a critical target, posing a big threat to their backline, or even just cut off their line of sight with your huge shield. I actually don't mind playing her into snipers since the shield protects you from one shots.\n\nI'm by no means a high rank though but that's my experience", "label": 0}

{"text": "Depends, I mostly get stuck as support, so I play support a lot, but it's not my favorite class, just what I get stuck as. In support, there are 3 characters I'm really good with, moria, Lucio, and lifeweaver. Moria is probably my best all around because of heals and damage, but I have the least amount of fun as her. Lucio is probably the most character I have with because of his speed and wall skating. But I lack a little in the heals because none of my teams ever stay close enough together to heal multiple of them at once, which an aura heal I should be doing. And lifeweaver has a bit of a balance between getting high heal numbers and using air dashes and platforms to stay alive in fights, which I find fun. But because I'm always so busy healing my team, I rarely get to help out with dps. Overall, I'd go with lifeweaver since it would be the most fun and balanced enough to make me useful.\n\nTank is probably my worst class, but the one I get stuck in the second most. There it's easy. I'm really only consistently good with 2 characters, muaga and Ram. And I would probably stick with Ram since he's versatile, and I think he's more fun to play.\n\nLast is dps, I have the most fun being dps, but I almost never, I do mean never get to be dps, and most of the time when I do I'm getting backfilled into a team that is getting stomped on and a dps quit and the game is almost over sometime before I even to pick a character. But there are 2 big options for me there. One is torn, I whoop some ass with torn I get to back somewhere place a turrent and provide additional fire while repairing the current and just rack up damage and / or kills. But this isn't always the most fun gameplay. The second is echo. And I don't give a damn about her ultimate being able to be other heroes. I use it and all, but the end of the it's her beam, sticky cluster missles, and flight that make her so much fun for me. I love popping up into the air and raining down hell on an enemy before closing in close to the ground and finishing them with a well place beam blast. And as long as there isn't a really good sniper on their team I can stay in the air for a long enough time that by time I hit the ground I can immediately blast back up and escape to heal up reload or whatever else I wanna do. So echo would definitely be my choice there.\n\nAnd out of the three from each class echo would still be my favorite most fun to play as, so even though I get to use her the very least of my favs she's probably be who I take as my permanent character.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'd say I would trust players to make a normal comp and want to win. But my experience with pre-role queue showed me that that just doesn't happen. Too many players are selfish and just want to play the hero that they want to play. I had countless triple and quadruple dps team comps where we lost to normal 2-2-2 comps. If there's a chance to have 3 dps in a team comp, it's just gonna happen all the time because it's the most popular role. Maybe less so in Competitive, but probably not that much less.", "label": 0}
