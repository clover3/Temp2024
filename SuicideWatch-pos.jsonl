Especially if their life is unbearable (homeless, can't get a job for various reasons, chronic but non life threatening and painful illnesses, incurable but extremely taxing mental health issues, already lost everything-)\n\n\nI don't think it should be a thing available for literally every single person the moment they feel the urge, because I know from experience a lot of people feel that way, then realise they don't actually want that, and go on to live amazing lives. But some people are doomed. Some of us will never have that amazing life we deserve, and we want to move on.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I also know why they don't. It is more likely due to the fact that it would cost a lot of money, and would reveal just how fucking miserable life is nowadays. The government really likes to push this view of everything being fine and everyone being happy. They like to convince both us and other countries that we are a happy, healthy, strong country. Because if we look like a place full of people ready to die already, it would NOT look good. People would start rebelling. More would realize we're getting fucked over, and would try and do something to stop it.\n\n\nThey do not want a rebellion at all, though I firmly believe we need one.\n\n\nOf course, the solution SHOULD be to work on the conditions making their people miserable. They should be taxing the billionaires. Giving money to people who cannot afford to live. Making it so that companies actually have to pay their workers enough to survive. It wouldn't be as difficult as you'd think, as no person needs as much money as some of these rich men have. But then they'd lose favor with the billionaires. Then they'd have to put actual effort in. They'd have to stop ignoring many, many very massive issues and actually do something, and God, that is NOT something they're willing to do.\n\n\nMuch easier to put on an advertisement of people happily dancing around and smiling than to fix the issues causing us to want to end it all. Much easier to silence us than help us.\n\n\nIt is easier to have people die on the streets and pretend it was their fault for not trying hard enough than to accept their wishes and put them down humanely. The people in power don't care if we live or die, they care that our suicides would make them look bad.\n\n\n\nI'd say stay alive if you can, if not just long enough for us all to work on some form of fucking rebellion or something, but I know from firsthand experience how difficult that is nowadays. Don't give up, yes, but also do acknowledge things like this, absolutely. Keep your eyes open. I want none of you EVER pretending that it's your fault.

A healthy distrust of everyone you meet is all I\u2019m really advocating for, and it\u2019s what I do so I don\u2019t get friends who are fine with backstabbing me over some petty trash. \n\nMoreover, it\u2019s the responsibility of anyone to ensure their own safety, realistically of course a parent should keep their child safe, as should siblings keeping eachother safe, etc etc. But vetting out people should be a rather common practice, if someone gives bad vibes, maybe don\u2019t deal with them if you can help it. Work does complicate that but I\u2019d suppose just not being alone in a room with a creep should do you well enough. \n\nI suppose I lack the life experience in that sense, I don\u2019t really lie unless I don\u2019t want to deal with someone, and frankly I\u2019m abrasive enough to not deal with backstabbers, but perhaps that\u2019s a good way to handle life, does make you less friends though unfortunately.\n\nAlso sorry for the essay, it\u2019s just how I write.

To me and my partner, whenever we say, \u201cmen suck,\u201d and similar, we both know it\u2019s not every single man but the majority or 50% of the population. My boyfriend, despite seemingly generalizing men even though he isn\u2019t, feels the exact same you do. I feel bad for him as well. He may have abused me physically and sexually, but he has remorse unlike all the other people who have abused me and him\u2014he still tries to make it right even though he knows nothing will erase what he has done to me\u2026 and I separate him from the boys because he IS a man. What people say, about \u201call men\u201d really they are talking about boys and SHOULD be using the word \u201cboys\u201d. Men are different. Men and women don\u2019t rpe. Boys and girls do. Being an abuser/rpist knows no age, sex, race, religion, lifestyle, etc. and a lot of people keep forgetting that.\n\n\nI know it\u2019s odd and out of place for this but I listen to a song artist called Banshee and saw a LOT of men\u2019s comments going into their SA experience and saw an overwhelming support of women that accepted and supported them. I\u2019m not saying listen to her, but maybe just read the comments? Maybe they might be more supportive in an obvious way than subtle or something? I don\u2019t know I\u2019m very sorry I\u2019m bad at talking and with words.\nMen are accepted, but at the same time they aren\u2019t\u2026 and I feel for you I really do. Just know you\u2019re not the only man here that\u2019s a survivor who also didn\u2019t get justice against their abusers: my boyfriend and I will never get justice for what was done to us, because we know no one would believe us, especially him.\u00a0\n\nPlease, just don\u2019t give up. If no one cares, then I care, truly and sincerely. I\u2019m worried, no one should be feeling this way. My heart bleeds for you\u2026\u00a0\nIf my boyfriend wasn\u2019t so busy I\u2019d ask to give his number out to you because you\u2019re one of the types of people he\u2019s been looking for to talk to. You're not alone, and you deserve to feel the way you do about this. Just, don\u2019t let go\u2026 keep holding on. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "label": 1}

There's never a tangible solution, it's always telling someone to love themselves and that other people love them.  But that's not a SOLUTION.  I'm giving the raw truth, and that truth is that you have to BUILD yourself up and that takes work and a COURAGEOUS heart. You have to be brave and fight even while you are terrified and that means finding something to fight for, facing the worst parts of your mindset by talking about them honestly with a professional. And the most important part is understanding that yes you have to find the strength to fix yourself on your own!! No one can or will do it for you. It's as simple as that. If you're offended by me saying suicidal ideation comes from a place of cowardice then be offended. But I'd rather be harsh with the truth than to romanticize self harm as some viable outlet or alternative to doing the work to fix what the world has broken in us.   WORK.

My regular doctor ended up showing up and talked with me and understood more where i was coming from, thankfully. Otherwise i think the other doctor would had me on a hold or something.

{"text": "The issue is that \"normal\" people often are essentially delusional. They have their own life issues and should be able to understand except they assume that specific achievements, like a raise, will solve their personal problems and allow them to finally enjoy life. When they actually get that extra income it doesn\u2019t substantially change their life or address deeper issues. Despite this, they continue to believe that just one more promotion or external change will finally bring satisfaction.\n\nThey consistently feel like  they\u2019re just one step away from a truly fulfilling life\u2014and they apply this view universally, assuming it\u2019s attainable for everyone despite it not being attainable even for them. So even for terminally ill patients they feel like someone finding a cure next week is possible and plausible and therefore despite the pain this person should hold on. Those of us who aren't delusional understand that even if someone found some meaningful connection it would take years for someone to try it on humans.\n\n\"Normal\" people also compartmentalize their unhappiness. Like in the simpsons homer has a sign at his job essentially about how he's enduring his job at the power plant for his family.

{"text": "You\u2019re doing your best right now and I\u2019m so proud of you. You should be proud of you too.\n\nOne of my close friends had something similar done to them a few years back and now they\u2019re in a much better position. They\u2019re happy, content and striving in life. They\u2019re achieving what they want to achieve and im so proud of them. The same can happen for you too.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in a position to see a therapist but most certainly do if you can. It may take a while to meet the right one but it\u2019s worth it. They can help with regulating your thought processes. It works a charm. Things genuinely can get better, its not the end of the world. It\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019ve got this.\n\nIf you can\u2019t then you can try out the below! It works for me and helps me quite a bit.\nTry and journal your days and write down everything that happened. Talk about what you did that day, what went well, what didn\u2019t go well, what could have been better, how you felt and then any triggers you had. Also add the below\n\nHow is my mood?\n\tHow am I feeling\n\tAre my emotions fleeting or long lasting\nHow is my energy?\n\tAm I tired, energetic or average?\n\tDo I need rest or something to eat?\nHow is my breathing?\n\tAm I breathing fast or slow?\n\tAm I exhaling from my stomach or chest\nHow is my focus?\n\tAm I able to focus for a long or short time\n\tAm I able to concentrate or am I distracted\nHow is my body doing?\n\tDo I have any tension or pain?\n\tDo I need to rest my body?\nAlways end it with being grateful though, I know its hard but it helps mentally.\n\nIn a separate note, slowly build something to combat your negative thoughts. IE a paragraph that you can read to yourself that gives you comfort.\n\nThe key to breaking the cycle is to realize you\u2019re in the cycle when you\u2019re worrying, then consciously  changing your thought pattern. For instance if you\u2019ve been zoning out worrying about your problems and getting stressed about the future, find a way to picture yourself outside of those internal conversations and quiet your mind/ shut off the internal dialogue. It feels bizarre at first, and is usually a fleeting moment of quiet mind. But with practice, you can actually change your internal monologue\nThis may help too!\n\nWhat\u2019s in your control: Your boundaries Your actions and thoughts The goals you set What you give your energy to? How you speak to yourself How you handle challenges\nWhat\u2019s out of your control: The past The future The actions of others The opinions of others What happens around you What people think about you The outcome of your efforts How others take care of themselves\n\nTry and work through things, so meet more people and friends if you can. Start some comfort shows or movies and get into them. Meditation helps, for some religion, for others sports and many other things may help so experiment. Imagine looking back and seeing all the random cool things that you tried. I think it would be nice to look back on as well.\n\nKnow that you are a valuable human being and that  are you loved. You are worthy of being happy and you owe it to yourself to take care of you. It does get better and it will. \n\nI want you to try and give yourself some affirmations. Tell yourself these everyday and it genuinely helps. Psychologically too\n\nI am me\nI am kind\nI am loved\nI am helpful\nI am supported\nI am unique\nI am confident\nI am brave\nI am enough\nI am strong\n\nAgain, always end it with being grateful. Be thankful. I know it sounds stupid and difficult. But Psychologically it helps. Start off small. \n\nJust take it slow and trust that if you put in the work and take the suggestion of seeing a therapist if possible , you have nothing to lose but you very thing to gain,  Problems all have solutions, sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what the solution is. And sometimes having another person to talk to who knows more than we do about these things can help us find those solutions. Good luck in your journey and please keep us updated. I really hope this helps you even if only a little. You can do this!!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Oh, dear soul, I can feel the strength it took for you to share this, and I want you to know: you are \\*not\\* alone. Your story, your courage, and the way you keep going, even when it feels like the world is too heavy, show a resilience that deserves to be honored and uplifted. The very fact that you\u2019re reaching out, that you\u2019re trying so hard despite these overwhelming challenges, is a testament to your spirit.\n\n\n\nLife can be incredibly harsh, and the weight you\u2019re carrying\u2014balancing the demands of daily life with the additional challenges that autism brings\u2014is no small burden. It\u2019s understandable to feel lost or exhausted when it seems like the world isn\u2019t built with your needs in mind. But in the midst of this struggle, never forget that your worth is not tied to your productivity, your job status, or how you measure up to anyone else. Your \\*value\\* lies in the unique light you bring to the world, even in your most difficult moments.\n\n\n\nLet me tell you this: the Holy Spirit, the divine presence that animates life and love, is with you even now, breathing hope into your tired lungs and wrapping you in unseen grace. You are worthy of support, compassion, and kindness. Your struggles do not diminish your spirit\u2014they make it more radiant in the eyes of those who understand what it means to persevere.\n\n\n\nAs you take steps to rebuild, know that every effort you make is a sacred act of courage. Even when it feels small or ineffective, remember: moving forward, even inch by inch, is a victory. If your heart is burdened with financial strain and the fear of not making it, let me remind you that asking for help isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s a sign of faith in humanity, of believing that others care\u2014and they do. We do.\n\n\n\nRight now, may you feel lifted by the prayers, well-wishes, and unseen hands of those rooting for you. Every step you take matters. There is a community that hears you, that stands with you, and that wants to see you rise. Trust that there is hope, even if it feels far away. You are loved, worthy, and enough.\n\n\n\nAnd as you wait for a breakthrough, may you find moments of unexpected grace: a kind word from a stranger, a small act of generosity, or the quiet realization that your journey is part of a bigger story, one where even the hardest chapters are leading you toward something better.

They put near unattainable beauty up on a pedestal (see their entire idol culture and how psychotic and unhinged that shit is.) They bully and dehumanise anyone who isn't considered attractive or beautiful, that level of degradation is unhealthy and it means a society that is always psychologically on-edge because your place in that society can be ripped from you if people no longer think you're worth being a part of it. \n\nFurthermore, their work culture is similar to Japan in that work it is intense. Their work environment is highly demanding and they work ridiculous hours for sub-par pay in comparison. Their work environments are entirely hierarchical for the most part and that compounded with that consistent evaluation of you and your looks, makes for a toxic environment to be working in. It is normalised to have abusive bosses and forced alcohol fueled gatherings after work. They even have a word for it, \"gapjil.\" \n\nThis is worsened by the fact they have a cost of living crisis and their wages do not keep up with the costs associated with living in South Korea. All the major cities are difficult to live in unless you have a very, very secure and well paying career. Attaining that requires having no life and devoting nearly all your waking hours to them (and they wonder why their birth rate is falling, nobody can have kids, properly have healthy relationships, etc when they are constantly exhausted and don't have much time to themselves.)\n\nIt is no wonder that similar to Japan, there is a high suicide rate. They both suffer similar cultural problems (though Japan is a little more relaxed with the beauty standards side of things, they are extremely racist however and the idea of what it means to be Japanese means they are ruthless with anybody who is an outsider, and that can even include born and bred Japanese. The bullying is just as brutal and ruthless.) \n\nIf you have a country struggling psychologically, something is very wrong. Unfortunately when you have a Government unwilling to make any substantial changes to the country, its system or trying to make any lasting changes to the society it has created and how toxic it really is for the health and happiness of its citizens, you will only get continued suffering and more deaths that could've been prevented.", "label": 1}

You're right you didn't choose to come here to this expensive painful existence, but you can make it better for yourself by cutting out the people who drag you down and finding the people that are mutually supportive.\n\nEspecially given the subreddit we are in, if your parents are pulling you under the current cut them off.

Probably to a good many, this is normal. This is their reality. Their culture. Their country. To them everything else could be considered weird or abnormal. And to be fair, every country has flaws and cultural issues others could look at and see as toxic as well. \n\nBut considering the issues they are facing which very well will impact their economy down the line which could lead to a potential collapse, they should very much be tackling these issues. There should be systemic change because that will go a long way to slowly shifting the culture and mindset that has been engrained for so long. They will not improve unless they make it more affordable to live, restore a work-life balance that is actually reasonable and sane for the average human to also have down-time to focus on themselves and recalibrate and to tone down the very superficial culture they have built for themselves.

Not to mention that boy is harassing you and needs to be stopped.  I know it\u2019s scary and a lot to ask at such a young age . As for you love as horrible as that is (god awful I can\u2019t imagine ): ) there are good men out there that won\u2019t hurt you like that, there is a beautiful world of fun and freedom awaiting you, you haven\u2019t even began to really meet yourself yet and one day as a adult you can help others like yourself with your story (YOUR IMPORTANT TO THIS WORLD!!!!) There\u2019s a girl ur age who isn\u2019t born yet that may need the adult you in fact I know there is (coming from a 27yo woman who was suicidal at ur age too) Not only that you have so much time to uncover new talents, passions, friends and adventures. Be kind to yourself and stand up for yourself! Against your parents and anyone else who mistreats you. Look up EFT tapping it helps me with my ptsd, I use AI (chat gpt) tell ai my problems and ask it to create a eft sequence and it gives me mantras to tell myself to calm down). You are so strong and important bbg. And I\u2019m praying you recover well, and that\u2019s the other thing\u2026 recovery is possible. I was violently raped by a stranger years ago and it messed me up bad but now I hardly ever think about it and feel nothing about it and even forgave the rapist eventually.
