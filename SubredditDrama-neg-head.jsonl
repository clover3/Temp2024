One of the points she made was how a lot of these men are suffering from male imposed standards of patriarchy but how sometime when you tell them that, they still for whatever reason will try to shift the blame to feminism. Another thing that was really interesting was how she also said how the left will call out toxic masculinity without really offering a more positive counter imagery of masculinity to aspire to. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s gonna take to stop young men to stop being radicalized to the right, but it\u2019s a scary problem and it\u2019s hard to see as a young adult.

The first big boom was [food advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MflT0I7ZPCs), the second was the rise of social media: namely Instagram and communities like /r/food \n\nRegular people addicted to food picture algorithms dramatically underestimate what good quality lighting, plating and slight trickery can do. As [Dan Olsen mused](https://youtu.be/4EXVrzOACv4?si=A8QniBd69gRX3WcX&t=614):\n \n> One of the things you learn really fast working with food is that while it\u2019s not that hard to make it look, you know, at least good and appetizing, it\u2019s also really, really, really easy to make it look awful, to end up with a delicious sauce that looks like greasy vomit. And this is because your kitchen is probably a terrible place to make videos. \n> \n> It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s cluttered, you\u2019ve got dishes piled up because you\u2019ve been shooting cooking videos for three days, the light is all on the wrong side of the room from the stove, which is where you\u2019re working, and the stove itself is lit by a truly abominable 8 watt bulb that just makes everything look like just greasy and ugly. Every stray bit of grime is going to make you feel so gross the moment you\u2019re looking at it on video.\n\nFunnily enough I think people who make some food pics regularly without big lighting setups and have space for natural light shining in on their kitchen, are in far more expensive houses than they let on. It's kind of a privilege if you have a large kitchen table with multiple wide windows giving natural light to your cuisine.\n\nCooking is a life skill, but there's a certain gate keepiness or rather 'WELL ITS SO EASY DUH' that kinda reeks of privilege and people neglect to mention that certain advantages and privileges make it much easier to learn how to cook.\n\nSome of the best cooks I know spent an extended period of time completely alone, by themselves with close access to a grocery or farmer's market. When you can experiment, make complete crap, eat the crap on your own, with no judgement other than yourself, and don't have to worry about anyone else's allergies or the smell or the mess that you can clean up on your schedule, it becomes a whole lot easier to cook.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I regret that the other user is making their point somewhat poorly. More generally I find that this sort of discourse is often poorly articulated - from the way it is conducted online, to the way it is picked up by media, to the way it is parroted by politicians and demagogues, so that ultimately it results in a fruitless and even damaging exercise. \n\nThere is one particular human dynamic that I feel is never discussed but that I think lies at the core of most complaints. \n\nFundamentally, everyone loves to be cherished, listened and supported, and everyone detests to be condemned. I find myself in a vantage position that allows me to experience both sides of this phenomenon. \n\nAs a man, whenever I hear generalizations on how terrible and problematic and disgusting men are, I must wrestle the impulse of saying that it is not true, that men are not like that, that I and the men that I love are not like that. \n\nOn the other hand, as a minority, whenever I hear that we have it the worst in society, and that we are disadvantaged and mistreated and penalized at every turn I catch myself nodding and saying \"ain't that the truth? finally someone says is like it is\". \n\nThis dynamic is constant to all people, regardless of factual considerations; everyone likes to be seen as the underdog victim of the world, and hates to be seen as the villain. I think that in order to reverse the evergrowing social division and achieve an harmonious tomorrow, we must not only tackle the material inequalities, but also cultivate a culture of cherishing and public celebration for all. \n\nIn these regards the main difference between the genders I would say is that there is no public movement that focuses on pure support and celebration of men. Partly of course because there's a lesser need for it; no bigoted grifter wants to remove men's rights, so men can only imagine how it must feel to be in that position. \n\nAll of this is just to raise attention on the fact that there is a man who doesn't feel affiliation with the powerful man that dominate society and that dictates the laws for all - there's no unity between the two, no equivalence, and thus when the latter is criticized in wide terms like \"men\", the former feels caught in the fire, disparaged, alienated from men and women alike, and if not careful he will really start to think himself an enemy of progress and equality, and see threats everywhere. \n\nThe bottom line is that we should really pinpoint our enemies with accuracy, and be careful not to disenfranchise those that would be our allies if we cherished them.", "label": 0}

They\u2019re generally centrist, and the Overton window on what is centrist is either stabilizing or moving back to actual center, whereas it\u2019s been tilting left over the years since about the 60s. \n\nGradually we will, as a society, return to some semblance of sanity in the next few cycles, I think. The problem here is that the polarization has been so profound over the past several cycles that the progressives are really going batshit insane, and their strongest opposition has to tilt further and further right to reach homeostasis. I remember when W was a Nazi. Then McCain and Palin were Nazis. Then Romney was a Nazi. Then Trump is Hitler. Three times in a row now. To be fair, I only became truly cognizant that elections were a thing when HW, Clinton, and Perot were running, but I didn\u2019t know much of anything about it. Maybe HW was called a Nazi too, I dunno. \n\nThe thing is, literally none of them were Nazis or even remotely fascistic. W ran on the economy, and was forced into other roles by the largest terror attack in US history. Trump was, by and large, actually a good president, despite the massive amounts of opposition thrown his way literally the entirety of his presidency. The closest things we\u2019ve had to fascism in the presidency that I can even think of were pretty insane reactions to world changing events; Lincoln and his suspension of habeus corpus and FDR\u2019s internment camps, were both a result of hellacious wars. The slaughter and relocation of many thousands of native Americans under Jackson which was pretty much on the same level as every pro slavery government from the founding on. \n\n\nThe rhetoric these days is really only worsened by a complicit media and a gullible populace. Biden and Harris are not Stalin. Trump and Vance are not Hitler. I personally think we need to stay away from democrat policies, but I\u2019m aware that republican policies aren\u2019t a golden ticket to perfection. Moderate your own thoughts, folks. Stay away from pundits and research actual facts. The sound bites they show you don\u2019t tell the whole story. Unsubstantiated accusations aren\u2019t proof of anything. You should not be watching anything that tries to tell you what to think. You\u2019re better than that. Handmaid\u2019s Tale isn\u2019t real, and never will be. Hunger Games isn\u2019t real and never will be. Dune isn\u2019t real and never will be. Warhammer 40k is t real and never will be. \n\nI\u2019m probably rambling at this point, but what I guess I\u2019m trying to get at here is this: we, the people, need to take control and responsibility for our own lives and our own thoughts. Don\u2019t let the opinions of others lead you to do things against your conscience. Don\u2019t fall for all the propaganda, and vote for the policies that make sense to you, regardless of which mouth presents them. \n\nI wish you all well.", "label": 0}

It's some of the very toxic masculinity traits we should be avoiding. \n\nThat's probably from years of getting a lot of unwarranted hate from right wing chuds, but not everyone who disagrees with him is a chud. The whole \"platforming a terrorist\" thing is a pretty good example. Admittedly, I saw the clip out of context, but I saw he was very angry and exasperated about the issue and was seemingly trying to deflect any blame from himself. He wasn't taking the criticism gracefully, and it seems to be a pattern for him as I've seen many clips of him blowing up at fairly small or rightful criticism. He just gets riled up about it instead of actually taking a breathe to figure out why people are saying it. I wouldn't consider that to be a good role model. \n\nI'll also say, role models don't always need to be leftist. I know a lot of people want that because they trust leftists more (though, I think that trust can often lead to complacency), but I've met some more liberal or moderate people that are very good people overall. Keanu Reeves seems like a cool dude, and I don't think he's secretly a socialist or something. Fiction can also work, for example, before the \"sequel\", I know many people looked to Atticus Finch as a role model. Also, women can be good role models for men.
