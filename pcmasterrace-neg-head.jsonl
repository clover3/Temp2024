{"text": "Whoever you talked to is pretty clueless. People who work with Linux in their job are probably doing some heavy IT stuff, which involves a completely different cognition than Linux for the consumer.\n\nThe vast majority of games work on Linux. Not many developers make native builds for Linux, so adapter software called Wine is used to make Windows games compatible with Linux. The Steam client has its own version of Wine integrated in a user-friendly way, called Proton. The vast majority of games run through it as well they do on Windows, sometimes better. The troubled area is competitive multiplayer games that use some form of invasive anti-cheat system. For those games, it will depend on the policy of the developer as to whether or not it will work on Linux. Overwatch 2, for instance, works great on Linux. All Blizzard games work well on Linux, and have for quite awhile. I just add BattleNet in Steam as a non-Steam game, set it to use Proton under its Steam properties, and it's good to go. However, I know Destiny 2, League of Legends, and Fortnite, are banned from Linux. If you're into those types of games, you'll have to make sure the ones you play are allowed on Linux. [ProtonDB.com](http://ProtonDB.com) is a good resource to check these things.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the Steam Deck is fundamentally a handheld PC running Valve's own Linux distro, and its been very successful in gaming, so that should give you an idea.\n\nFor switching distros, it would just be a matter of installing a new one on top of the old one. You can set it up so that when you install a Linux distro, certain folders can be isolated on their own partition apart from the OS's partition, so when you install a new distro you can more easily migrate. Your *home* folder is where all the typical user stuff goes. I always like to set up the *home* folder on its own partition with most of the space for this reason, and leave the OS partition, simply */*, with 100GB. Again, keep some installation media for Windows and your preferred Linux distro always on hand, in case things go wrong or the bootloaders screw with each other.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This isn't necessarily true, also it isn't water in the OP but likely some type of perfluorocarbon fluid with a low boiling point. Cray had been cooling supercomputers with this throughout the 80s and 90s, and 3M has run a nearly decade long material compatibility test with this in the mid 2000s. It's true that material compatibility is a challenge but at least with regard to perfluorocarbon fluids we have a very good idea as to what materials are compatible. As to servicing risk, essentially none, you just want to wear long insulated nitrile gloves to protect from the heat when you pull a server out, and I'd also recommend a respirator that filters out organic vapors, but servicing is as easy as pulling out the server, waiting 10 seconds for it to air/drip dry, replacing whatever components you need and dropping it back in the tank. Also not true that the only people taking it seriously are those selling it, there's been massive interest in this tech from public sector agencies and Nvidia. Although Nvidia is almost certainly working on their own implementation of this same technology. Two phase immersion cooling is an inevitability in the AI sector, with chips getting ever more powerful we are reaching the limit of what can be purely air-cooled , once we get chips firmly north of 1000 watts demand for this tech will grow. \n\nSource: server engineer in the industry", "label": 0}

These people do clean up after themselves but the service will do shit like clean the walls, lug a steam cleaner around. They're paid to be meticulous not just clean. They will also do cursory cleaning of everything with more of a focus on fine details as the general cleaning is a quick process.  The process here was just wiping and polishing yhe desk real fast.

The only way Windows laptops nowadays match the battery life of macbooks is by simply including a larger battery, the efficient is not there yet on windows.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ryzen AI 9 series is AMD's most efficient laptop chip and it idles at 3w, and draws up to 20w in single core workloads, meanwhile Apple M3 idles at 0.7w and only needs 8w or so to beat AMD, Apple M1 draws just 4.5w(!) Meaning even tho it has lower performance It's still more efficient than 4nm X86 chips designed for efficiency. High Multi core is useless on thin and light laptops and laptops in general, nobody is gonna hit 20 threads at once, the performance of each thread per each watt is the most important metric.\n\n\n\n\nIntel lunar lake solved the idle power draw for X86 and sits at just 0.7w, but still draws around 13w in single core tests while losing to M3 at 8w.
