{"text": "First of all, the mods don't like the creeps any more than anyone else does, just for the record. We don't care about \"protecting\" them. It's safe to say that most, if not all of the mod team would be totally fine with creeps being exposed for the creeps that they are, including to the creep's friends, family, co-workers, and employers. In fact, there are places on the internet where that can be done, too (some Facebook groups, some forums/blogs, some other kinds of social media, etc.). \r\n\r\nHowever...\r\n\r\nReddit comes down hard on subs that are seen to allow or encourage any kind of harassment or brigading, so that's a big reason we require fairly extensive censoring.\r\n\r\nAlso, in a system where anyone could put anyone's name, face, username, or other identifying information online to \"out\" them as a creep, it would be easy to fake an exchange with that information in order to generate a mob to go after them. This is in no way implying that this or any other particular post is fake! However, in a system where you could openly display someone's details and information, it would be trivially easy to hack the system and put a whole heap of internet rage on pretty much anyone you wanted, whether they deserved it or not. \r\n\r\nOn the plus side, because the person's identity is not shown, you can say any kind of mean shit you want to and we're under no obligation to take it down, even if the creep complains (and they sometimes do, too).", "label": 0}

A human would likely play with you first. Bleed you dry. Bring your world to a crashing halt and tear it apart. A human would make everyone blame you for what they did. Then a human would laugh about it. \n\n\n  I am homeless. I have much better times when I am in the forest alone, than when I have to deal with the ladies and gents whether homeless or housed. It's irksome when I am told, \"not all women,\" because that almost makes it worse somehow. Interacting with the human race is like some irl version of a game wherein you see many doors ahead of you. Some lead to a tolerable fate, most lead to peril, and one of them might be a mutually fulfilling bond. The latter most of all isn't guaranteed to last. It could end abruptly if you fall short of a high standard one time, or if they notice anyone who has some thing which you do not. \n\n\n  When I hear ladies say they'd rather choose the bear, it makes Me sad, but not offended or shocked at all. It makes Me empathize with those who had to suffer some Real Life\u2122\ufe0f, and have seen humans for what they are. As for Me, if I had a choice, I'd choose not the bear; rather thousands of bags of fetty at varied weight & potency with a whole bunch of rigs. That way, I find the comfort one would find in the certain death of the bear yet without the pain; I'd find comfort in each bag until the Final Comfort of leaving the human race behind.\n\n\n  However I'm not going to face the final curtain. Being homeless is freeing. I often choose to avoid a major source of negativity by staying away from people. I'm happy most of the time because most of the time I'm in the forest.", "label": 0}
