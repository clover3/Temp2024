{"text": "So archaeologist here who knows several of the scholars who worked on this site personally and professionally, plus several others behind the scenes doing really important and amazing scientific analysis. There are a lot of abandoned cities in Central Asia, as well as fortified fortresses and caravanserai (stop over areas). Some places on obviously are still thriving metropolises, like Bukhara and Samarkand etc (and absolutely wonderful places to visit I might add), but climate change, political change, resource use and need etc mean things shift around. I know this site is way up in the mountains and a bit hard to get to, in terms of dig sites, likely due to forestry for cutting trees for smelting, but this site has been worked on for several years and is run by truly experts. I would watch that space if you are curious and want to learn more. Or check out their actual academic work, which is widely open access accessible online. We in a bit of a silk roads Renaissance at the moment, so anyone wants to learn more, basic starting is Peter frankopans silk roads, but I would really recommend reading books about it by Susan Whitfield or Valerie Hansen. Or information on the new exhibition at the British museum and the scholars involved (especially Tim Williams, professor of silk roads archaeology at the UCL Institute of archaeology and magnificent scholar). and if you want to read more fun Info about travel along this road in the 18-19th centuries into early 20th I highly recommend foreign devils on the silk roads by Peter Hopkirk, which talks heavily about aurel stein, Hungarian and British archaeologist who traveled into interior western China and found a lot of amazing artefacts that have shaped a huge swath of knowledge today. He was a bit of a dodgy character and the book is good at highlighting chinas not so happy views on him but it\u2019s worth a read to see European colonisation and collecting in the region that has played a part in shaping major museums in the west. There\u2019s a big book called Silk Roads: Peoples, Cultures, Landscapes by Susan Whitfield that is collaborated by like a hundred other scholars writing on every topic in a short and sweet way with the most stunning photography. It\u2019s a very good overview and a beautiful coffee table book. If interested in Central Asia, there is so much out there and it deserves recognition. Frachettis team is doing great work and I am so glad to see it known more by general audiences.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Jesus Christ, people. Historians do not only focus on one topic, one certain thing, and they do not bring out every single bit of their life every time they discuss a figure -- as that would just be unnecessary and, frankly, silly. Avoiding unnecessary narrative is one of the first things we train undergrad historian students to do. \n\nNor do we want to say that works cannot be written about those who engaged in support for terrible things like Nazism because they are taboo, as that just makes people even less likely to discuss these figures and we'll learn less about them and their lives, which does the opposite of helping people spot the issues and worrying trends. \n\nThere are millions of works written about Hitler, most of them are about him and Nazism, but there are also valuable works which look into his personal life, experiences, and boyhood long before he joined the party. That's what historians do, we gather all the information and look at all the evidence and make arguments anywhere we can find space for them. If someone wrote a book about Hilter's childhood and ended every sentence with \"also, he was a Nazi\" you'd go crazy and throw the book away within 3 pages. \n\nIt would be ridiculous to post \"yeah but he owned slaves, so\" in any thread about most of America's founding fathers, or \"yeah, but he still thought black people were inferior\" in a thread about Abe Lincoln's hat maker. You guys are the equivalent of those that bring up Lennon's terrible history regarding women whenever someone says they like the Beatles' use of drums. Just allow for a topic to exist. If you have a relevant part of their life that explains why certain things happened, then of course those things are then relevant and a holistic approach is necessary. If you think that her Nazi support led to the reputation she got, then post evidence for that and discuss that. Just posting \"who cares, she's a Nazi\" or the similar posts we have here helps no one, is useless to the conversation, and is just plain lazy. \n\nWallis Simpson can be a Nazi sympathiser and someone who we have great evidence of misogyny and conspiracy theory for, just like we can study Adolf Hitler and his diet, and care of/for animals. There's room for it all.", "label": 0}

{"text": "My assumption would be: They were seeing the cranes from below.\n\nBeak length is too long for a swan. Beak color is wrong for a swan in that area (possibly correct for *Anser cygnoides* today, but that may have been secondary to domestication). It should be the darker pigment they were using on the wings if they wanted to get that correct. Considering the artistry the rest of the thing shows, I am assuming it was a deliberate choice not to do that. \n\nThe primary flight feather pattern is actually pretty accurate to a Siberian Crane... but only if you are either looking at a Siberian crane with open wings, or a Siberian Crane flying overhead. The black flight primaries are only on the underside of the wing. When folded (when on the ground), the bird's wings are obviously pretty white, and do *not* display that characteristic black pattern.\n\nSo, imagine you only see this species of Crane when it is flying overhead - and it does have a pretty long migration route. So you assume that black pattern is on the *top* of the wing as well. You can see the beak is longer than a swan's but you don't know what the top looks like. But the other large bird with similar mostly white feathers in the area is the swan, so you give it the swan's characteristic basal knob.\n\nIt isn't as if the Pazyryk culture is lacking in crane imagery otherwise: another crane, the [Demoiselle Crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoiselle_crane), has been [found depicted on Pazyryk ceremonial headwear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1563011009000452).", "label": 0}

{"text": "As a Russian, I am glad to see Russian military history in the thread.\n\nThere is no clear idea of \u200b\u200bwhat was meant by this term in any given case.\n\nThe term \"Gulay-gorod\" itself has transformed over the course of its history.\n\nDuring the period of Russian history known as the Time of Troubles, the term \"Gulay-gorod\" was used only by the Poles. It is known from the battles near Moscow in 1609 and 1611. In the conditions of active use of firearms, the classic shield Gulay-gorod could not find active use.\n\nAlready in the campaign against the first False Dmitry, the Streltsy hid behind mobile tours - sleds filled with hay - an invention that found wide application in the wars of the 17th century. Later, trenches and obstacles were actively used in field battles. It is in this context that the use of the Gulay-gorod should be considered.\n\nOver time, \"Gulay-gorod\" was not only not shields on wheels, but carts reinforced with shields, i.e. a version of the wagenburg. Accordingly, now there was no function of rapid transfer, but a function of defense on the march. In both cases, \"Gulay-gorod\" was not used as a long-term defense. It should also be remembered that during the time of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, \"Gulay-gorod\" was the name given to assault artillery towers.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Thanks for putting up this article. A gentle correction: calling the Shu state, or more broadly, the Ba-Shu culture (\u5df4\u8700\u6587\u5316) as a 'Chinese dynasty' is rather misleading. Firstly, the territories of what is now China were not historically all Chinese. The [Ba and Shu culture had a script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%E2%80%93Shu_scripts) unrelated to the Chinese Seal Script. The script remains undeciphered. \n\nBa and Shu were conquered by a Chinese state known as Qin (\u79e6\u56fd), a country which would become the first empire of China. In this process of imperial conquest, it did not just 'reunify' Chinese lands as traditional historiography portrays, but also colonized and conquered other non-Chinese cultures such as the Ba-Shu culture. I call it colonialism, because economic exploitation was key to Qin imperial policy: following the Legalist philosophy of Shang Yang (\u5546\u9785), Ba and Shu's rich agriculture was necessary to fuel to Qin's increasingly militarized society, since Qin lands were resource-scarce. \n\nAnother issue is to call it a 'dynasty'. Note that the dynastic model of Chinese history only emerged during the Han empire (roughly 2nd century BCE - early 3rd century CE). Ba and Shu were conquered centuries earlier, in 316 BCE. The calling of Ba-Shu, and even the Shang and Zhou as 'dynasties' (as the article did), is a *retrospective* claim. I.e. imagine calling the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as \u2018British republics'. \n\nLastly, the term 'legendary' is inappropriate. Ba and Shu are well attested in Chinese historical records during the Warring States period. These are not legends. One can only reasonably argue that the mythical Xia and perhaps the early Shang state records were quasi-legendary.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Of course it's important to remember things like \"hey, these were real people\" and also \"they had the same brain that we have\" (especially when discussing people from antiquity.... they had access to less information, but could process information and think as critically as us). I've been working in the field for far too long, and even sometimes I'll get hit with that, obvious, but somehow soul searing reminder that all these people lived, all of them died, some brutally. And that they were just like me. I do think that sort of thing is important to remember, that you could be someone that someone else is studying in texts 2000 years from now. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure what you mean by bringing them to life. Are you trying to picture them in a certain way, imagine their personalities, etc? If that's what gets you excited about history then that's great, but it's something that a historian would try to avoid as it causes a lot of biases. \n\nA great example of this is the Laconophiles (Sparta-maniacs), who post youtube videos about the Spartans as if they're terminator machines who never lose battles, are the bravest, strongest, best force in the world, and would never have emotions, etc. etc. This is a picture that people have been putting in other's heads for millennia (i.e. Herodotus), but was amplified in the modern age by things like the 300 comic and movie. \n\nFalling in love and assuming things about these people and having it play out as it would in your head brings in your own biases about them and can make you ignore things that counter this; if that makes sense.", "label": 0}

It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million.

Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?  \nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps  \nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?  \nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

{"text": "The context here is the collapse of the Han empire. The following years saw a re-arrangement of Chinese states into Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Sun Wu. Although all three claimed imperial hegemony over Chinese lands, only Shu Han sought to revive the Han empire, Liu Bei being a distant relative of the Liu ruling clan of Han. Cao Wei would emerge the victor, but not without the usurpation of the Sima Clan to form the Sima Jin empire. \n\nSo even from this we can see there is no simple political continuity from Han to Cao Wei, as Cao Wei does not claim continuity with the Han - it was Shu Han that claimed said continuity. This does not deny they were Chinese states, only that their continuity is complex at best. \n\nAnother piece of evidence is how, [as historian Mark Elliott pointed out](https://scholar.harvard.edu/elliott/publications/%E2%80%9Chushuo-northern-other-and-naming-han-chinese%E2%80%9D), the term *hanren* (Han people) ceased its usage for a few centuries after the collapse of the Han dynasty/empire. Why? Becuase Hanren refers to the citizens of the Han empire, and when the country fell, the term correspondingly fell from usage. It would be revived later in subsequent centuries to denote *ethnic*, rather than *state* identity, hence our current understanding of 'Han Chinese' as an ethnic group.", "label": 0}

The necessary materials are available everywhere, so there wasn't need to change the most basic design.

Then you sharpen some sticks for arrows, and that's about it. You can hunt rabbits now.\n\nHowever to hunt bigger game or to make the bow a viable weapon of war, you need to improve the basic design somehow. You need a more powerful bow and more accurate and deadly arrows. Once you look beyond the superficial similarity of \"all bows are a string attached to each end of a bendy thing, and all arrows are long sharp sticks\", you notice that those improvements resulted in some very different designs that were popular in different parts of the world.\n\nThe English longbow and the Mongol recursive composite bow are both *bows,* but that's where the similarities end. The former is a carefully selected long straight piece of a single tree. The latter is a curved construction made of wood, horn, leather, sinew and glue (which made them particularly susceptible to rain).\n\nSimilarly the arrow designs evolved a lot according to what they were used for. A good armor piercing arrow would be almost useless as a hunting arrow, and vice versa.", "label": 0}

Carthage may have figured out a good defense, a la the  the Sicilian Expedition. Which brings up another point, what was \"them\" we aren't really sure what a corvus was. Sure, Polybius gives a description, but the same description almost to the word is given for another completely different maritime device, the sambuca. IF they did cease to exist early in the war, that was 55ish years before Polybius was born, and 75ish years before he would have ever been to Rome. Polybius probably did not view a corvus in his lifetime. And of course there's several arguments that it was more akin to a grappling hook. I don't particularly buy that, but I don't think it's a Roman invention but a Roman adaption of other boarding tools. \n\n>It makes the ships incredibly less stable\n\nThis is a really outdated argument and is no longer accepted. See in particular Wallinga's thesis from ~1955 and follow the historiography from there. \n\n>Then lost another one for the same reason a few years later.\n\nSo they could lose fleets with the corvus, they could lose fleets without the corvus, so it doesn't seem to matter if the corvus is attached. The reality is that every single group that we have substantial narrative for of naval activity has lost fleets. The Athenians, the Carthaginians, the Persians, it's part of the deal. We have a lot more info on some of these, which means we have more disasters to study, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they had more than average as we don't know what's happening with about 99.9% of fleets in the Ancient Med.", "label": 0}
