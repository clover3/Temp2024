{"text": "As I see it, digital twins hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare.

This capability can indeed save lives by enabling more precise interventions with fewer errors, ensuring timely care.  \nIn my experience with Electronic Health Records (EHR) projects, I've seen how digital twins can integrate with EHR systems to provide seamless access to patient data. This integration is essential for ensuring information accuracy, facilitating quality monitoring in healthcare delivery, and improving overall patient outcomes.  \n  \nFor instance, we tackled challenges such as converting brand-name drugs to generics in electronic prescriptions to prevent overdoses and identifying drug interactions to enhance patient safety.

And in small towns, you might have community shuttles or better train systems that are more frequent and connect rural and urban areas. \n\nIn terms of daily life and commodities, I imagine local communities would play a bigger role. If goods were locally sourced, that would mean less need to transport stuff long distances. People might walk or bike for groceries or errands.

{"text": "\\> Renewables+storage are vastly cheaper & simpler.\n\nThat's a straight lie. Not only does the technology not even exist to do storage at scale the amount of storage we could achieve is unfathomably more expensive than nuclear.\n\nLook at the latest Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy+ study. Renewables are about half the cost of nuclear power. Renewables + 4 hours of storage is price competitive with nuclear. As it turns out, it can be cloudy and the air can be still at the same time. And it can do those 2 things for extended periods of time. To have a reliable renewable based grid, you need to be able to run exclusively off batteries FOR WEEKS.\n\n\\> Although reasonably high levels of reliability can be reached by solar-wind resources alone, the defining challenge of such systems are the longer-duration gaps, often associated with extreme weather episodes. For instance, historical solar and wind resources data in Germany reveal that there were nearly 2 weeks in which dispatchable generation had to cover practically all of the demand because of a period with very low solar and wind power availability (called \u201cdark doldrums\u201d)\n\n\\> \\[...\\]\n\n\\> For example, the energy storage capacities we consider are in some cases quite large: energy storage equal to 12\u2009h of mean electricity demand in the contiguous U.S., Germany, and Japan represents 5.6, 0.7, and 1.4 TWh, respectively (Supplementary Data 5). These combined storage capacities represent \\~35 times the capacity of Li-ion batteries produced globally to date, and more than 200 times the pumped hydro storage capacities that now exist in those countries.\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26355-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26355-z)\n\nTo reiterate: 12 hours of storage for 3 countries requires 35 times more storage than has been produced in history. And we need several weeks worth of storage for every country.\n\nStorage isn't even a solved problem yet. We literally can't do it. To say that it is simpler and cheaper is insane.", "label": 1}

That's why I gave a hypothetical. I'm trying to establish that you're argument falls apart at the extremes. Please stop bringing it back to real world when I'm using a thought experiment. \n\n1 of 2 things is happening here that I'm trying to distinguish between with the thought experiment. Either you're OK with forcing vaccines if something is dangerous enough, in which case you're bodily autonomy argue doesn't stand unless we know exactly how dangerous a brand new disease is, or you think bodily autonomy still stands even at the extremes, in which case I wish you well in whatever non US country you're interested in. \n\nYour examples of CHOOSING vaccines when they made sense to you don't differentiate between the two possibilities. That's why I gave an extreme hypothetical.\n\nSorry if I'm being pedantic, I just find this pattern occurs literally 100% of the time with conservatives, where I struggle to get them to engage with hypotheticals.\n\nIt's still love though u/Exciting_Prune_5853 even if you dodge questions like fence sitting liberal cuck :p", "label": 1}
