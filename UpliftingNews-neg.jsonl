{"text": "I disagree. Giving people money they didn't earn leads to inflation. Cutting taxes does not. \n\nAllow me to explain. There are two components to the economy, supply and demand, and when they operate approximately in balance, life is pretty good. Everyone is consuming things (which is inevitable ... we must have food, shelter and clothing) but nearly everyone is producing things, too. To spend $1, I first have to earn that dollar and thus put a dollar's worth of goods or services back into the economy for someone else to purchase. \n\nWhen the government borrows money and gives it to people didn't earn it, it spikes the \"demand\" side of the teeter-totter. Now people can spend more without necessarily producing more. You wind up with too many dollars chasing too few goods, and that leads to inflation, as sellers are able to raise their prices to vacuum up all of the extra money in circulation. (We saw this happen with food prices after the billions allocated to the SNAP program were doubled between 2019-2023.) \n\nLetting people keep more of the money they've earned (tax cuts) doesn't have the same effect. It doesn't create \"new money\" the way borrowing does. The same amount of money is still in circulation; the only differences is that it's being spent by the people who earned it and not the government that confiscated it via taxes. \n\nI generally agree with you on military spending but we're living in dangerous times. Israel and Iran are attacking each other and North Korean soldiers are training in Russia, presumably to join the fray in Ukraine. Our senile president and feckless vice president have been utterly incompetent in addressing the international situation, putting us all in peril.

{"text": "Let\u2019s get to the root of it\u2014healthcare in America has become an outlier among first-world nations. Most other developed countries provide healthcare to their citizens as a fundamental right, not as a privilege tied to employment. For a society that prides itself on independence and innovation, why have we trapped so many working Americans in jobs solely for benefits like healthcare? This dependency on employer-provided insurance doesn\u2019t support freedom; it\u2019s a tether.\n\nTrue freedom includes the right to live without the constant anxiety of medical costs wiping out your savings or debt dictating your future. Healthcare isn\u2019t about handouts; it\u2019s about providing stability so people can invest back into the economy, start businesses, and support their families without health being the gamble. And, for anyone who worries that government-provided healthcare will diminish job incentives, consider this: better health creates a stronger workforce. If corporations in the 1950s promised health benefits to attract talent, why shouldn\u2019t we raise the standard and make healthcare a guarantee in 2024?\n\nThe decline in union power didn\u2019t start with the social programs of the \u201960s. It began with policies favoring corporate interests and outsourcing that undercut bargaining power. Imagine if more workers had health security\u2014unions might have thrived even more, able to negotiate for better wages without the baggage of healthcare coverage in the mix.\n\nThe call for universal healthcare isn\u2019t about \u2018waiting on the government\u2019\u2014it\u2019s about finally catching up to the rest of the developed world on a moral and economic level. This isn\u2019t about ideology. It\u2019s about progress that supports every worker, every family, and the country as a whole.

Which, I guess if you think you should be subsidized by the sick, poor, and elderly then, I guess I disagree?

It's annoying, but some of the adult sets are pretty good value, the botanical ones are great for example.\n\nSo too many big sets combined with inflation gives the impression that lego is wildly more expensive when it used to be when it's really not the case.\n\nHonestly lego pricing is pretty all over that place sometimes, so it's best to look at it on a set by set basis, sometimes a set will be horribly priced while another will be priced quite cheap. For some of the best value I'd look into sets and themes aimed at kids. Lego city and friends have some great sets that are amazing value. The recent city construction vehicles look great and are priced really well. Even licenced themes are priced pretty good sometimes, like the falcon I mentioned earlier but a great example is the new fortnite sets, they are priced extremely competitively.", "label": 0}

Much of that spending was triggered by Trump\u2019s travel, or the travel of his family and aides.*\n\n*$17,000 per month for a cottage*\n\n*Trump\u2019s club in Bedminster, N.J., charges the Secret Service $17,000 a month, every month, from May to November each year. The reason: the Secret Service uses a cottage on the club grounds, near the cottages that Trump and his daughter Ivanka use.These rental charges \u2014 which are unusually high for homes in the area \u2014 continue whether Trump or his family are present or not.

Trump\u2019s Miami resort was the biggest beneficiary, collecting $274,000, followed by his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey with $266,000 and one of his Scottish resorts with $181,000. At least $760,000 of taxpayer money was disbursed at properties Trump owns entirely. The rest went to businesses in where he is a partial owner or has a licensing or management agreement.*\n\n*\u201cAs president, Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his businesses created an environment rife with the potential for abuse.

Viral disease is diverse, as is cancer and medicine faces those challenges with diverse treatments. \n\nYou're right to point to the many past successes and potential future successes of vaccines, but you should think similarly for cancer.\n\nIt's simply a reflection of what cancer is (or any broad group of diseases) that the concept of a single cure doesn't really make sense and is extremely unlikely, however it's not necessary. Having a range of treatments to treat a range of cancers is appropriate.\n\nIncidentally, vaccines can prevent cancer.

Way too much screentime is spent on showing the serial killer\u2019s previous kills.

{"text": "By their own admission, [roughly 6% of unincarcerated American men are rapists, and the authors acknowledge that their methods will have led to an *underestimate*. Higher estimates are closer to 14%.](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/repeat-rape-and-multiple-offending-among-undetected-rapists)\n\nThat comes out to somewhere between 1 in 17 and 1 in 7 unincarcerated men in America being rapists, with a cluster of studies showing about 1 in 8. \n\nThe numbers can't really be explained away by small sizes, as sample sizes can be quite large, and statistical tests of proportionality show even the best case scenario, looking at the study that the authors acknowledge is an underestimate, the 99% confidence interval shows it's at least as bad as 1 in 20, which is nowhere near where most people think it is. People will go through all kinds of mental gymnastics to convince themselves it's not that bad, or it's not that bad *anymore* (in fact, [it's arguably getting worse](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-sexual-attacks-teen-girls-increased-lockdown-rcna70782)).

This reinforces that our starting point [should be to believe (not dismiss) survivors, and investigate rapes properly](https://www.startribune.com/a-better-way-to-investigate-rape-denied-justice-part-eight/501636971/).\n\n> Some law enforcement agencies may be under-investigating sexual assault or domestic violence reports without being aware of the pattern. For instance, in most jurisdictions, the reported rate of sexual assaults typically exceeds the homicide rate. If homicides exceed sexual assaults in a particular jurisdiction, this may^62 be an indication that the agency is misclassifying or under-investigating incidents of sexual assault. Similarly, studies indicate that almost two-thirds to three quarters of domestic violence incidents would be properly classified as \u201cassaults\u201d in law enforcement incident reports.^63 Therefore, if the ratio of arrest reports for lesser offenses (e.g., disorderly conduct) is significantly greater than that for assaults, this may indicate that law enforcement officers are not correctly identifying the underlying behavior \u2013 i.e., they are classifying serious domestic violence incidents as less serious infractions, such as disorderly conduct.^64\n\n-https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/799366/download\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[False accusations are rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#False_accusation), and [typically don't name an offender](https://search.proquest.com/openview/6cdfce302d24baf26d72790d2bf2feba/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41641). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> [It is notable that in general the greater the scrutiny applied to police classifications, the lower the rate of false reporting detected.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210387747)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rape is one of the most severe of all traumas, causing multiple, long-term negative outcomes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38d2/cc8df92f64acb9141d6d8ef0d79d0ce2fe15.pdf), [regardless of perpetrator tactics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262661/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n###[Take action](https://www.reddit.com/r/stoprape/wiki/index/#wiki_take_action)", "label": 0}

The inflation target is 2%, meaning grocery prices will still increase, just at a slower rate. The grocery prices will probably not come back down to where they were before.\n\nIf you have negative inflation, or price decreases, this is very bad for the economy, as everyone with money is incentivized not to spend it, since it will be worth more in the future.

Those banks and investors find the people who need a mortgage and the business looking for a loan for upgrades, loaning the money you invested to people who have immediate plans with big price tags. The money pays for actual work to happen, and you get more value from the money than you otherwise would.\n\nThis wouldn't be necessary except human beings are *incredibly* risk averse. We'd rather take a guaranteed 1% increase in the value of our money from deflation than a 4% average return from an investment account against 2% inflation, even if the latter is better for ourselves and society at large. So near-universally countries target a low rate of annual inflation ([*near* universally](https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2021/12/why-is-turkeys-president-cutting-interest-rates-spurring-inflation-and-lowering-the-value-of-the-lira?lang=en)) to push people to make choices that are more profitable for themselves and enable others to actually *do* things with the money that would otherwise sit idle.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> makes me wonder if we can have deflation without a recession tied to it\n\nunfortunately, you can't, because of the impact that deflation has on economic behavior. People and corporations behave differently in an inflationary environment vs. a deflationary one. \n\nIn an inflationary environment, a dollar is worth more today than it is worth tomorrow. This encourages you to go out and spend or invest that dollar. It puts the money into businesses either directly or indirectly (investment, or purchase of goods/services), and then the business uses that money to grow the business, which contributes to future productivity. They put the money into opening a new factory, or maybe they launch a research project to develop a new technology. (Yes, some of the money goes to shareholders. Not all of it is re-invested) But overall, in this manner, the economy as a whole grows. \n\nIn a deflationary environment, your dollar is worth more tomorrow than it is worth today. This causes you to want to save your money instead of spending it. You delay large purchases with the expectation that the item will become cheaper if you buy it next year instead of now. Businesses do the same thing. They see a slowdown in sales, because consumers aren't spending money. What income they do have does not get re-invested in growing the business, because capital investments in hardware, technology, etc. take time to pay themselves off. The ROI on these projects starts to look really bad if you have to pay for them up-front with more valuable dollars, and the increased return you get in the future is received in less-valuable, deflated dollars. So in a deflationary space, businesses don't invest in productivity or innovation, so there isn't anything to cause them to grow. Instead, they shrink a little because their existing revenue streams thin out a bit. Shrinking GDP - definition of recession. \n\nThis is why the target for inflation is a small, positive number.", "label": 0}

Republican politician in the past and he posted a pretty lengthy tweet explaining why he's endorsing and voting for Harris.\n\n[Here's the tweet](https://x.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1851627802027758005) for those who want to read it. For those who don't use Twitter:\n\n*I don\u2019t really do endorsements. I\u2019m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don\u2019t trust most politicians.*\n\n*I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor.*\n\n*My time as Governor taught me to love policy and ignore politics. I\u2019m proud of the work I did to help clean up our air, create jobs, balance the budget, make the biggest infrastructure investment in state history, and take power from the politicians and give it back to the people when it comes to our redistricting process and our primaries in California.*\n\n*That\u2019s policy. It requires working with the other side, not insulting them to win your next election, and I know it isn\u2019t sexy to most people, but I love it when I can help make people\u2019s lives better with policies, like I still do through my institute at USC, where we fight for clean air and stripping the power from the politicians who rig the system against the people.*\n\n*Let me be honest with you: I don\u2019t like either party right now. My Republicans have forgotten the beauty of the free market, driven up deficits, and rejected election results. Democrats aren\u2019t any better at dealing with deficits, and I worry about their local policies hurting our cities with increased crime.*\n\n*It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isn\u2019t addicted to this crap, you probably understand.*\n\n*I want to tune out.*\n\n*But I can\u2019t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious.*\n\n*And I will always be an American before I am a Republican.*\n\n*That\u2019s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.*\n\n*I\u2019m sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do. You don\u2019t recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.*\n\n*For decades, we\u2019ve talked about the national debt. For decades, we\u2019ve talked about comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border while fixing our broken immigration system. And Washington does nothing.*\n\n*The problems just keep rolling, and we all keep getting angrier, because the only people that benefit from problems aren\u2019t you, the people. The only people that benefit from this crap are the politicians who prefer having talking points to win elections to the public service that will make Americans\u2019 lives better.*\n\n*It is a just game to them. But it is life for my fellow Americans. We should be pissed!*\n\n*But a candidate who won\u2019t respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that won\u2019t solve our problems.*\n\n*It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.*\n\n*We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won\u2019t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.*\n\n*That\u2019s enough reason for me to share my vote with all of you. I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and Walz.*\n\n*Vote this week. Turn the page and put this junk behind us.*\n\n*And even if you disagree with me, vote, because that\u2019s what we do as Americans. http://vote.org*", "label": 0}

{"text": "1) Poll Worker pay during the early voting period is almost 75% of the cost of running an election in Georgia, so even one extra day of early voting can make a significant dent in the budget of an elections department, which is usually one of the least funded parts of a government, and even asking for grants to help with that budget shortfall is now a 10 year mandatory minimum felony offense in Georgia.\n\n2) Georgia offers a legal minimum of 140 hours of open polls (8-5 over 16 days, minimum 2 of which are Saturdays, plus the 12 hours on election day itself) and a maximum of 228 hours (7-7 over 18 straight days, plus 7-7 on election day itself). Normally one additional day would also be included in the early voting availability, but Georgia's counties were banned from opening early voting on the regular start date of October 14th this year due to Columbus Day. This is far above the national average, with many states only offering three days of early voting or less, if at all.\n\n3) On the Saturday after the end of early voting, before Election Day, the full list of voters who have voted during early voting are loaded into the electronic poll books and printed out onto emergency precinct backup lists. This combats double voting schemes. On the day before election day, they perform final checks for delivery to precincts and in some cases prepare the precincts themselves for Election Day. Poll workers are the world's largest temporary workforce and organizing them, and the preparation, delivery of equipment to and retrieval of equipment from precincts is a herculean feat of logistics that takes time to make happen.\n\n4) In Georgia's case, most elections officials will have just finished working 70-100 hour weeks for the last month straight (for larger jurisdictions even longer), and need a weekend to recuperate for the high intensity 16-22 hour workday ahead of them on Election Day, plus the endless harassment while they prepare for results certification and multiple audits over the next two weeks. That's not even taking into account if runoffs or recounts occur- if those happen, some elections officials might not have their next day off until Christmas.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, there's a documentary on YouTube following elections officials in Rhode Island during 2020 called \"No Time to Fail\".
