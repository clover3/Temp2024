{"text": "It was an absolutely shit idea for Dual Class to last for 4 months.\n\n\nJust look at the recent and nultiple complaint threads here:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaHS/comments/1g63317/dual_class/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaHS/comments/1g0o92u/another_month_of_dual_class_arena/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaHS/comments/1fb2a13/when_is_dual_class_arena_going_away/\n\n\n\nTo summarise, (Dual Class) Arena has been in a miserable and terribly unbalanced state for many many weeks now, and I am saying this as someone with 8k wins solely in this Arena mode having played it for as long as the mode lasted. In other words, accumulated loads of experience and playtime in this very mode. And this is one of the lowest points in this mode in recent times.\n\n\nIf you think carefully about it, Dual Class actually *decreases* variety instead of increasing variety. Dual Class also simply makes it easier to get the top classes as a choice, and dramatically worsens competitiveness of non-synergistic drafts. It is nowhere fun as well, unless you enjoy playing the same 2-3 classes again and again.\n\n\nTo also show how easy it is for someone to barcode in Dual Class as well, few weeks ago I simply conceded (not retire) multiple games and redrafted until I got the 2 classes I wanted, and easily went 12 wins. It did not take me that much of gold as well, which I have plenty of in the first place anyway\u00a0\n\n\nHopefully u/RidiculousHat can pass on such feedback to the team and it is taken seriously by them, to never repeat such shit again.\u00a0\n\n\nI totally stopped playing the Arena mode (and entire game) in the last couple of weeks, and slowly getting used to not playing Hearthstone. I am quite sure there are few others out there behaving similarly like me. In fact, because of the recent time spent not playing Arena, I actually checked out Marvel Snap.\n\n\nI will see how Arena is for the next expansion, and if balance is similarly shit, it is likely a permanent goodbye for me.", "label": 1}

{"text": "A 40% win rate (WR) deck can still have a significant impact on a meta, even if it doesn't appear overwhelmingly powerful. Here's a detailed breakdown of why and how this happens:\n\n1. Disrupting Key Strategies\nA 40% WR deck could have a particularly strong matchup against specific popular or dominant decks, making it a viable counter even if it generally performs poorly overall. When this happens, it effectively gates the dominance of stronger decks, preventing them from overwhelming the meta. This can result in more varied deck choices and shake up the ecosystem.\n\n2. Influencing Deck-Building Decisions\nEven if it loses frequently, a 40% WR deck can still force players to tech against it. Players might add specific cards or adjust strategies solely to deal with it, which dilutes their decks\u2019 effectiveness against the rest of the field. For example, if the deck uses cards that are difficult to counter without committing resources, it can pressure other decks to include suboptimal cards, indirectly affecting matchups across the board.\n\n3. Increasing Frustration in the Meta\nSometimes, a 40% WR deck isn\u2019t designed to win quickly or easily but to disrupt the opponent's strategy or draw the game out. Decks like these might employ frustrating mechanics like heavy control, attrition, or randomness, making the gameplay feel unenjoyable or inconsistent. Even if they don\u2019t win often, they can discourage people from playing certain archetypes and strategies, affecting which decks see play and ultimately shifting the meta.\n\n4. Narrowing the Meta by Countering Certain Playstyles\nIf the 40% WR deck has a favorable matchup against popular deck archetypes (like aggro, control, or combo), it can lead to those archetypes becoming less common. This, in turn, can make the meta more homogeneous, as only decks that fare well against both the popular strategies and the 40% WR deck remain viable.\n\n5. Creating a Ripple Effect in Ladder Play\nIn ladder systems, where players frequently encounter certain decks at specific ranks, a 40% WR deck may still appear disproportionately if it\u2019s cheap, quick, or easy to play. This frequent appearance can push out decks that would otherwise perform well, creating a localized meta where players have to adapt against it. Even though it has a low win rate, it affects the ladder experience by crowding out other decks and reshaping rank-specific metas.\n\n6. Drawing Attention and Copycats\nSometimes, players are drawn to decks that are fun, novel, or challenging, regardless of win rate. If a deck gains popularity in the community, players might copy it or create variations, leading to more matchups against it. Even if these players don\u2019t find much success, they increase the deck's presence in the meta, causing ripple effects as other players adapt to it.", "label": 1}
