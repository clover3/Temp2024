And 7.5 million streams is the lowest possible number 7.5m listeners can give her, the actual earnings could be 2-10 times higher. \n\nI'd consider her to be very successful in music, so this actually makes me wonder two things \n\n1. Is she personally getting only a tiny fraction of the money that streaming her songs pays, cause then the two shouldn't be compared at all.\n2. Is she in the top 5% of onlyfans earners? Cause the success disparity is not so different there.\n\n\nTo me what all of this means is that musicians need to build multiple streams of income.

You're crying about 90% of the streaming marketing being owned by 3 companies and it seems you don't know that 90% of the music industry is controlled by 3 record labels, Sony, Universal and Warner. These are the companies you should be complaining about. \n\n>it's just what Spotify has decided it wanted to do, lol\n\nI really don't understand why the hate for artists not making enough money is directed at Spotify. They rarely turn profits, and have consistently lost money for most of their existence. They give 70% of everything they earn to the record labels. The record labels then gives artists a pittance of that. Doesn't matter if Spotify gives even 100% of the money it makes, cause record labels keep the majority.\nThe inherent unprofitable nature of music streaming is even more true for Apple music, YouTube music and Amazon music, whose massive losses are subsidised by the enormous profit their parent corporations earn through other sources. \n\nSo no, this isn't \"just what Spotify has decided it wants to do\". They already give the maximum they can to record labels without going bankrupt.\n\n>I want my musician friends eating better.\n\nThen tell the record labels to give artists their fair share.", "label": 0}

The\u00a0chance\u00a0of\u00a0possibly\u00a0getting a few votes from new homeowners*\n\n100% agreed, this also reminds me of the USA. Not only is the chance of getting a few votes slim, the actual problem is that construction takes sooo painfully long, that it will be most likely the next MPs/the other Party who will reap the benefits of the houses. That's the issue with the National Debt in the USA. Clinton was the last president who focused hard on reducing the national debt, and he did and created a budget surplus for the first time since Eisenhower. However not only did Voters care little about the reduction of debt/budget surplus, it was Bush who reaped the rewards by being able to spend literally TRILLIONS and massively increase the debt aswell. Since then the Democrats don't care about the national debt either... and it is at 37 trillion now. The US debt rises by 1 trillion every year now, and the INTEREST payments alone are 1.1 trillion each year, which is higher than their military budget which is \"only\" 916 billion. Neither Biden nor Trump talked about the debt in 2020, same with Harris & Trump in 2024, despite it being just insanely high.  \n\nSo yeah, not only an incentive not to do anything, but also an incentive to allow the problems to grow... If the problems grow --> they get more money. \n\nThat's ultimately why I mentioned the proverb of \"where there's a will there's a way\", there really just is no will for politicans to do anything.   \nAll we see from them is campaigning, same with this post.

Eyes, hair, mouth, neck, arms, hands, back, boobs, waist, hips, ass, thighs, calves, ankle, and feet. Oh, and voice.

{"text": "Drummer for a few smaller bands here. When we make physical copies, it's generally vinyl, sometimes tapes (still popular in genres such as black metal, punk, etc). Vinyl has the highest margin, you can get 12\" LPs for about 7 or 8 euro a piece from a presser for an order of 300 LPs, but this really depends on how fancy the cover is etc. Let's say you're keeping it cheap, that's 2100 euros for just pressing. Add another 1800 for recording, and ignore the costs of buying instruments and practicing, that's 3900 total, so you'll make a profit on anything over 13 euros. We usually sell at 25, so a margin of 12 per record sold, meaning we make around 120 on LPs per show with an average volume of 10 records sold. It's not a large amount, mostly a nice extra on top of the payment for the gig. Margins improve on higher volumes though, so it really becomes worth it if you scale up. I know bands that do around 3k in merch sales every show, often exceeding the ticket sales.", "label": 0}
