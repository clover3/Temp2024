{"text": "TLDR:\n\n  \nBuy Lows: \n\nGeorge Pickens - His opportunity share is off the charts this season. The connection with Russ looks like it could be a potential league winner. Between his air yardage, weighted opportunity, and under performing expected fantasy points, he's in line or a major breakout. \n\nRaheem Mostert - Juicy backfield with a heavy dose of a now likely expanding touchdown equity share. Plenty of volume to go around in this backfield that rips off chunk yardage with the best of them when humming.\n\n  \nSell Highs:\n\nTee Higgins - Out targeting Ja'Marr Chase and seeing more downfield work will/should not continue. A slightly tougher WR schedule (11th) lies ahead and things will likely shift in Chase's favor as the clear alpha on this team. \n\nDarnell Mooney - Aside from one blow up game, Mooney's numbers have been flex worthy and, with the emergency of Kyle Pitts and Bijan Robinson finally getting the usage he deserves, Mooney's volume will continue to take a hit. He's a flex level player with a decent floor that you're hoping falls into the end zone for a TD. This is Drake London's team.", "label": 0}
