Republicans from when you were growing up got burned by not adapting to social media and the internet - As a result, there was 8 years of Obama.

It got them a surprise victory in Trump, and if he hadn't completely botched Covid, it would've likely gotten him a second term, which he'd be done serving shortly.  Democrats adapted to that, and got a Biden victory. Now we're back in contesting territory.\n\nNo matter what (No matter what people are trying to tell you on social media), you're not voting on \"the last election ever\", and you don't have to constantly doom when you think about politicians - \"You must vote or democracy itself will die\" is a really tired slogan that hopefully will wear itself out pretty soon, along with trump rhetoric.

In fact, it\u2019s interesting to me that all the polls are right alongside Trafalgar because I assume they haven\u2019t changed their methodology, and they\u2019re not typically very accurate. Redfield is low rated. I can check on Quantus and Morning Consult, but I think they\u2019re low rated as well. FWIW, the last NY Times/Sienna polls (a very well-rated pollster) had Harris up by 3 or 4 in several polls. \n\nTrump has gained slightly, but it is really hard to tell if that\u2019s a meaningful gain or just noise. Truly. Furthermore, the polls always tighten toward the end. It\u2019s just much more noticeable and scary when Harris doesn\u2019t have much of a lead. I didn\u2019t worry when it happened to Biden, by the way. \n\nI totally agree that it\u2019s horrifying it\u2019s this close.

{"text": ">\n\n>How do you propose to do this?\n\nWe need to add an amendment to the Constitution to make public education a right.\n\nCurrently, there's nothing in the actual Constitution that says anything about public education. Because of that, it's a states rights issue under the Tenth amendment. States are the ones who directly control public education and what can and can't be taught; the only influence the federal government has is through the Dept. of Education, and that power is mainly through funding and doing its best to ensure that all students have an equitable education, usually by data collection and, well, controlling funds.  \n  \nWhen it comes to teaching critical thinking skills, there are Common Core standards. For example, Reading for Literature and Informational Standard 1 for multiple grades is citing textual evidence of what the text says explicitly as well as what it inferences. We have students learn this by, say, reading The Giver or various articles. The skill they're learning is to cite evidence if they're going to state a text says \\*insert claim\\*, and they're learning think critically about texts - what is something saying even if it's not outright saying it. Pretty important skills.   \n  \nExcept, there's nothing by law to enforce Common Core standards. Federal government can't make states adopt them. States that do aren't necessarily implementing them correctly. Common Core may not be perfect, but because there's no mandatory enforcement, there's no policies about making sure all teachers are trained in understanding and implementing Common Core correctly. Therefore, in some places Common Core is a failure - because the people using them don't understand *how* to use them. They're designed to teach skills that can be transferred outside of the classroom, but if districts and teachers don't understand how to pair the standards to curriculum and pedagogy, they're useless and confusing.\n\nIf there was an amendment about education, the Dept. of Education could actually force states to teach to standards where students learn to think critically and grow to become adults who can discern true from false information and analyze a politician's rhetoric to find the fascist undertones (or, you know, overt dog whistles). Until then, things like Oklahoma getting away with (for now) having Bibles in their classrooms can continue to happen. Hopefully that's struck down by the First amendment, but if education was actually controlled by the federal government, Oklahoma would probably have been stopped before even implementing the policy.", "label": 0}

Most of the stuff we are sending is old inventory that would cost us more to dispose of than to ship to the Ukrainians.  The rest is new production that creates jobs here. \n\nThe way to end this war is to help the Ukrainians deliver a crushing defeat to Russia. Trump's idea of strong-arming Ukraine into a defeat to appease Putin is just going to make Putin want more later.  Russia will only stop when they see toppling Ukraine as an unachievable goal. I don't think we need boots on the ground yet, but if it comes to that NATO might want to step in.  Aggression cannot be rewarded.\n\nNote that this is not a change in US policy.
