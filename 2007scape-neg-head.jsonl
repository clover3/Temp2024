Never had an account with over 60 in any skill just would restart and chop trees you feel. \n\nGot into OSRS with friends later in life one of whom had a ton of bossing kc and he pushed us to try small things.  Some of the most fun things I\u2019ve done in the game are CG, TOA, and Calvarion. I haven\u2019t touched most of the wildy bosses, and have done neither of the two raids. Scurrius is decent fun and doing woox walk at Vorkath makes it more enjoyable. I haven\u2019t down GWD bosses outside of getting 1 kc each and some group runs at Garagedoor (not fun at all, dumbest shit I\u2019ve done in the game imo) but if I ever get bowfa I\u2019m going to try the 6:1 or whatever at Kril and I feel like that\u2019ll be fun. Kalphite Queen will forever be ass and people recommending barrows are on drugs I think super lame. It\u2019s not hard and you could probably make it fun and it might be fun for others but I can\u2019t stand it haha.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The biggest problems I saw was that protection prayers weren't easy to give up so they had to stay, buffed versions of some prayers were straight upgrades with the downside not being impactful enough to warrant caring about, and while some god alignments vibed with a majority other ones didn't.\n\nSo, I'm assuming this prayer book has to be from a difficult quest. Why not make the reward your regular prayer book getting enhanced. Too hard to move away from protection prayers? Lean into them instead. Modify the existing prayer book, adding in the new prayers also, and then you won't have the issue of it being too similar to what we have.\n\nYou would still be swapping your prayer book like we do with magic, but all the current prayers are buffed, just keeping with the mentality that this improvement is high risk high reward.\n\nProtection prayers. Take (avoidable and able to pray against) damage off prayer and your god alignment is impacted, turning off all prayers for a certain time. If the source of damage is rng, like KQ or Zulrah, it instead gives stacks equal to the amount of correctly prayed against random attacks consecutively. Guessing incorrectly removes all stacks, reducing the damage you take from the next random attack by 30% per token.\n\nI believe this solves the problem of it being too similar to what we have, because it is what we have. Just with added conditions with consequences and rewards. I hated that chip damage was a main factor in the protection prayers being kept. The problem is, everything is balanced around the current prayers, so any new prayer book is going to feel similar in a big way.\n\nSo then just work with what we've already got. Get creative with it, really give some consequences to your actions. Add a chance to parry with piety active and missing the chance to click the boss for a counter instead has the boss counter you instead. Rapid restore heals you at 1hp per two ticks now, but only works in combat and getting hit off prayer while it's active could have you bleed for a bit at x? the rate of its restoration.\n\nI'd like to know if these are at all viable ideas that I thought up in the last 20 minutes and didn't care too much to think about the consequences (thematic) of adding them to the game.\n\nI also didn't have anything to add on the god alignment prayers themselves, just the existing ones.", "label": 0}
