{"text": "So i found this while cleaning out a friends factory after he had people living there that up and left leaving some unwanted things behind. I was told by someone that this is used to tune the sub ghz something or other for boats that travel into a certain depth/body of water.\n\nIt had a sticker saying \u201cMelbourne\u201d on the back, and there is a white plastic top cover the same as the back, i have just misplaced it.\n\nAs you can see it plugs in via usb. On the cord that I found with it, it says: Front PC - Com 5, TR PC Com 8, GC PC - Com 9 (admin). \u201cMust use these com parts as options E5\u201d\n\nI have tried using google lens and usually can identify most computer and other IC\u2019s or components on pcb\u2019s and the like, but this little guy had me totally stumped.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated to put my mind at ease. I have OCD and it\u2019s torture not being able to work it out.\n\nThanks in advance!\nLouis\u270c\ufe0f", "label": 1}

{"text": "Rifle, Short Magazine Lee Enfield, model No1 Mk3* to give it its full name.  The SMLE was the British and Commonwealth rifle of WW1.  However the No1 Mk3* was a modified version that was produced in peacetime in the 1920s up to WW2.  They\u2019re usually a good rifle.  The trigger on the Mk4 is often a bit rough.  The Mk1 is much sought after, easily identified by the volley sights and magazine cut-off.  \n\nThis one has been sporterised, which happened to a lot of them.  I had a Parker-Hale sporter for years that shot like a dream.  Definitely minute-of-deer capable, and the .303 is a great round for medium sized game.  \n\n.303br round has been around for a long time, since 1889.  The tapered case and rim make it incredibly reliable, even when hot or dirty.  It\u2019s very easy to hand load if you can\u2019t find ammunition.", "label": 1}

A large number of commonwealth countries used (and manufactured) this rifle beyond the Lee Enfield factory. Even a few US factories made these. Given the korean war, and that the UK and Canada has already largely moved over to the No.4 mk1 (though the No.1 Mk III was still in use to some extent), my guess would be this is likely an Australian or New Zealand rifle. If this is the case it should have a Lithgow Arms makers mark under the bolt handle. If not it might be a Belgian, Dutch or Luxembourg rifle as they also served in Korea, and got a bunch of these post WW2 from the UK.", "label": 1}
