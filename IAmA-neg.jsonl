We were told the child needed to be transported to uw hospital for additional imaging. After 4 hours of sitting in a room we were then told the child should stay at the hospital overnight until they could get further imaging as they couldn't quite read the previous images. 24 hours later a CPS worker came into the room to tell my wife they believed the child was being abused and had skull fractures consistent with child abuse and the child would need to stay with another family for 3-4 weeks for monitoring. Needless to say we were blindsided as this all started from what we thought were preventative X-rays. You can imagine the hospital staff was convinced I was abusing the child and that's why I wasn't there. When I got there I had to fight to have the images shown to me and I demanded a second opinion. After 6 hours a nurse came into the room and said we got a second opinion and there's no trauma you can leave now. That was the end of it we could just walk out the door. I have never wanted to make a scene so badly in my life. We ended up hearing about Barbra Knox and connected the dots that she was the dr who initially read our images.

Or, just go to literally any circus (I'm a grown-ass adult and I went to see Big Apple Circus in NYC on my own twice and nobody arrested me). \n\nFor more interactive or satirical or weird shit, you want \"theatrical clown.\" \n\nIf you are near Toronto (Sweet Action) or San Francisco (Church of Clown) those theatre venues are specifically dedicated to clown. New York has occasional clown shows, use your Google Fu for the latest. If you are in Orlando, Winnipeg, Toronto, or Edmonton, all of their Fringe festivals are large enough that you're guaranteed to find a clown show or several on the schedule. Montreal I believe has a decent year-round scene but they also have a clown festival.

So watch those early rounds through a different lens, and you'll see some of those \"bad\" auditions as the intentional works of clown genius that they are. \n\nThe one clown who most famously broke out of that was Viggo Venn, who went on to win Britain's Got Talent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5mVIYPG4MA \n\nI also like to make the case that Conan O'Brien's remotes and travel shows are pure clown.

A good clown will make you feel something\u2026hopefully laugh, but they can do many other things. Clowns represent us. Chuck Jones the famous Warner Brothers cartoon animator used to tell us at Clown College, \u201cBugs Bunny is who we want to be, but Daffy Duck is who we are.\u201d Clowns represent that something in everyone who tries and fails, but gets back up and tries again.\u00a0\n\nIn the current climate of clowns downplaying the external elements like bold make ups, my take is if your funny with a greeh yak hair wig and a red nose, you\u2019ll be funny without them. That stuff is part of an iconic circus tradition, but it\u2019s not required to have to be a clown.\u00a0\n\nThe return of Ringling using 3 clowns with no exaggerated make ups in their choice.

I personally wish they would use a more traditional look, but it\u2019s their show and the demographics they are going for, and the owners taste currently lean towards this more muted \u201clook\u201d in regards to their clowns.\u00a0", "label": 0}

{"text": "Thank you Greg! \n\nAs someone who just appreciates the form (though I performed a very little bit in the past), the disconnect to me isn't just about performers moving away from the traditional circus look, but also the fact the word \"clown\" purposely isn't being used in marketing those performers. \n\nIn the Ringling example, their website bends over backwards to not say \"clown.\" *\"Meet Equivokee. As fun to watch as it is to say out loud \u2013 go ahead, try it \u2013 this comedic trio from Ukraine introduces a unique blend of physical comedy and a modern take on circus classics like dance, juggling, mime, and more to their performance.\"*\n\nI think it reinforces the perception that \"clown\" is only a *descriptor of a look*, rather than a *genre of comedy*. When people sneer and say \"I hate clowns,\" it doesn't take much to make them admit they actually don't, they just hate the lazy 2-dimensional images of clowns they've been fed in pop culture. I wish we could more widely apply the label of \"clown\" to clowns whose looks don't match the cliche, because I think it could eventually cause those people to not instantly recoil when they hear the word. \n\nAgain, I'm not the one who has to get asses in seats and make a living at it (I bet your friends Steve and Ryan would have a good rebuttal). Everyone has to deal with the climate as it is.

I think the point still stands though, they'll all roughly the same types of people.  Just paid thugs who don't really care whether the system works or not, they just wanna wear a uniform and be seen as putting away the bad guys and get paid a fat check.  I almost became a lawyer but after working for a legal company for a while to dip my toes in while I was still in school, I witnessed SO much corruption and heard so many bad stories about how fucked the whole system is...plus talking on the phone with countless lawyers and judges, I realized I hated EVERYONE involved and the whole things needs to be burned to the ground.  Public defense attorneys are really the only good ones but they're so incredibly overworked and underpaid, they have so little power in that world.\n\nThe whole commonlaw system is also just broken from the start.  It was developed initially just to speed along trials and executions and make it cheaper for England to process trials.  The French system is entirely more fair and less focused on efficiency and more on fair trial.  In the USA, most cases are just about leverage and power, pushing everything possible straight to plea or settlement.  If you're poor or middle class, you're cooked.  Nobody but the rich can afford actual trials.  So when you've got such an overpowered system like that, it becomes very easy for the culture of the criminal justice system to always see itself as right because \"Oh look, 95%+ of people we prosecute end up plea'ing, proves they're guilty and we were right\".  If there were actual consequences for corruption, compensation for prosecution that doesn't result in conviction, cops would end up in jail for any abuses of power, etc, I think the culture would be much different.

{"text": "Hello, you're my first AMA A'ing me anything.  So let me set the tone by saying I'm going to free-form today.  Thanks for the open, genuine intro.  The deepest parts first -- fear.  When I was in medical school anatomy/cadaver lab, the tables -- 4 med students around each body -- are pretty close to one another in the room.  Sometimes, to get in and work, you have to move the arm.  So you're in close to the body and the arm is resting on your side. It's no different from positioning the patient during a surgery.   Someone at the table behind me had the idea to hold the cadaver's hand which was hanging behind my back and start to pull it down.  So it seemed like the cadaver was moving and trying to hold me to him.  Boy, did I jump and scream.  To laughter.  And some vague humiliation.   There are other medical school stories like that -- how med students manage.  But I think at that time I was afraid somehow of the body and \"dead.\"   I think at that stage you're just getting used to dead.  And something internal for me at that point in my life.  It's not different from clinic, when you're in you're early 20's starting and getting used to dealing with sexuality and sexual feelings and having to examine naked people.  It's a process of managing inside and outside on the way to \"I'm a professional.\".  By residency, I would say fear was never part of my experience with bodies.  I experience fear now -- or more anxiety -- I don't mean unmanaged panic -- or maybe tension -- but good tension (like before going on stage to perform) -- I mean my focus is so much the family that before the case I really don't want to miss anything and want to make sure I find what can be found.  But that's about my commitment to the family.  If I have a surgical case and the hospital won't release records so I can review the operative note, I'm afraid I'll miss something.  That kind of thing.  I want to do a good job.  But that's different.  Next:  suppress.  Reminds me of (guilty) some of the advice columns I read on the news apps.  \"I love my girlfriend's girlfriend, how do I 'make that go away'?\"  Kind of makes me bristle a bit.  Not one to recommend suppressing anything.  I'd say - \"manage.\" Or better \"make use of.\" The overriding way I manage whatever I'm feeling is through my commitment to the family.  No matter what I see that day, I know they're counting on me for clear information and for peace of mind, so that's what I think about and focus on, no matter what.  I suppose the simplest way to show that is that I hate horror movies -- send me to Disney -- but autopsies are really more in the spiritual realm for family emotional healing.  I love doing them because I love when there's an idea I can put together that helps the family feel better.  Practical note:  smells.  I have a tough time with decomp smells (not everyone does) and have been seen pacing on the other side of the room gagging until I can adjust.  Also, a specific thing:  the first look at the backs of decomps that have sat in plastic bags for a month.  And wriggling larvae are hard.  But I think it's because I'm not a forensic pathologist, I'm more a hospital pathologist.  I don't see those that often so my reactions are more kind of \"from the gut,\" so to speak.", "label": 0}
{"text": "At first I thought you meant, like to \"become an autopsy pathologist\" but you mean why a family would want to request and autopsy.  A lot more the first (sudden/mysterious).  A lot less the second but sometime.  But let me go backwards on this.  They may not donate, but the families who would go with donation/research are more likely to request an autopsy.  Not because their aiming for having the body add science knowledge, but because those families are comfortable with the body being \"worked on\" after death.  A quick rant:  I read recently about the ongoing push for \"virtual autopsies\" -- meaning radiographic assessment of the body postmortem rather than a \"cutting\" autopsy.  And the institutional pushing the technology listed the benefit as \"sparing\" families the \"trauma\" of having their loved one dissected.  Boiled my blood a bit.  It's just not true.  Every family is different.  For some, it would be that way.  The sacred, the spiritual, the importance of the intact body. But for others, it's just not important -- \"my father had and autopsy, my sister had an autopsy, I want an autopsy, sign me up!\"  The importance there is the knowledge from the case.  The closure.   The peace of mind.  That side of the spirituality.  So in that case, not looking in detail, not having the incision -- becomes a disservice.  End of rant.  The first part sudden and mystery are the way.  There is some piece missing.  Either, yes, the death was sudden.  Or the death might have been anticipated, or there was some long hospital course.  But never a diagnosis, or some symptoms that wasn't explained that is leaving the family mystified.  And then there's the whole emotional side -- guilt and anger.  I took care of grandma and she died, so I feel guilty (\"it's my fault\" (it never is)) so people request an autopsy to know \"they did everything\" or \"the hospital did everything.\"  There are many many reasons to ask.  Inheritance (alzheimer's).  Concern for malpractice.", "label": 0}
{"text": "While I'm thinking about the other more challenging questions, I'll answer this one.  Yes.  Commonly.  Pulmonary embolism (clot to the lungs from clot to the legs).  Also cardiac arrythmia (from hypertensive heart disease).  Although somehow recently, I'm getting a lot of upper GI bleeding from medications.  My populations is not \"the most common cause of death.\"  My population is the \"the most common cause of death that is confusing to families.\"  Pulmonary embolism is confusing, because it happens commonly when the patient was recently sick but feeling better.  That's when the person starts to walk around and a hidden clot in the legs detaches, goes up to the lungs and kills the patient.  So it's confusing to the family (\"they were doing better!\").  And arrythmias (and also heart attacks) can happen suddenly and before the patient has any other symptoms -- the patient seems to be doing well -- so those are confusing, too.", "label": 0}

There is no incentive.  It is an offer to families, like organ donation.  That, if it they feel their loved one would want this -- to teach and educate -- of if they, bearing legal rights, would value this, then this is something I am happy to offer.  For many families, it is an opportunity for death not to be in vain.  For the person to make a difference.  For the possibility that some other person will learn.  Some other provider do a better job caring for a different patient.  And (it was a surprise to me at first as I cautiously started), that it makes a world of (positive) difference to the families to be able to do this -- when, for the most part, they have been disempowered (unfortunately) in the health care system, by the loss, or other relationships along the way.  It is everything to them to have this option.  Not an unwanted extraction or exposure that needs to be incentivized.  And perhaps for context, I do not have a \"video-only\" option at present.  These families come to me for an autopsy they want.  And video-donation I mention as something I can do if they wish, during the consent process, face-to-face.  And just skip it if it doesn't resonate for them.  And in addition, my promise to them is not to expose the confidentiality.

By the same token, chemicals can move from foodstuffs (or from dishwasher water) into materials\u2013this will happen when materials are not inert, like plastics.

As much as I want to use looseleaf tea, the convenience of teabags makes them my go-to tea to drink.\n\nThere was [a study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b02540) that said tea bags shed billions of microparticles and nanoparticles into the tea. Especially some of the more fancy teabags that opt to use silk or some sort of synthetic material (Teavana tea, as an example). \n\nI can't find the link now, but I remember looking and finding a study that criticized the above study's methods. If I recall correctly, they had a 'clean' sample that had no contaminates, yet the sample was not held in a clean room, so therefore it seemed like the study may have been inaccurate as a clean sample would still have SOME contaminates. It also mentioned that tea temperatures don't usually get hot enough to shed that many plastics. \n\nI'll admit, I'd sleep a little better if I knew that tea bags weren't that terrible to use. \n\nCan you comment or help shed some light for me?", "label": 0}

One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life, regardless of the cause, so it can standardize the metric to compare health effects.\u00a0\n\nNow, to answer your question, we\u2019d need to have DALYs calculated for all those issues so we could see which changes made the biggest difference. We have some of these things but not all and further work would be needed to compare individual changes (some examples: [Plastic pollution](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4629311), [cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2787350), [ambient air pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720341589)). That\u2019s a bit beyond the scope of what I can answer here.\u00a0\n\nWhat I can say is that small changes can have effects on individual chemical burdens. For some chemicals that are broken down in the body quickly, like bisphenols and phthalates, there have been studies where participants changed how they cooked or what they ate and after a few weeks the levels of bisphenols a/o phthalates was lower. So those few chemicals can be directly tied to food practices.\u00a0\n\nSo, reducing the plastics used to cook and store food can have noticeable effects on certain chemicals in the body (for example, [bisphenol A](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.626070/full__;!!MXfaZl3l!Y4x-3ghgou7pu77TTnKVFVOhPy47C-CQzPxXXQetqIlm7pYBG67RSUZLrwv-no6eQq3JGeWT9CBbvaxx1wuGfiSrRdJAgRisVRPa4Bk$)). Additionally, vacuuming [household dust ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.9b04898)\u00a0can lower phthalate levels, and combinations of interventions lower many things ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463921001139), interventions described in section 2.3).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor myself, I try to make small changes when I can to hopefully add up over time. Since I can\u2019t know exactly how much will cause a problem and when. Chemical migration increases: over time, at higher temperatures, with fatty and/or acidic foods, and when packaged in smaller serving sizes.\u00a0 So I use this information when trying to balance certain decisions about what I purchase or how I cook.\u00a0\n\nI think it is important to keep in mind that these concerns around chemicals shouldn't have to, and largely can't, be tackled by consumers alone. Do what you can but try not to stress about it during daily life. When I first started in this field I got overwhelmed with information and had trouble making decisions about buying *anything*. Encourage change where you can, support change when you see it... live your life.\n\nThat got rambling\u2026 Thank you for coming to my TED talk.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Ok, I see where you are coming from u/delow0420 . It is not as simple as just smoking DMT and rewiring your brain to get your lost memory back. \n\nSince you are saying your \u201cbrain feels like jumbo word salad\u201d I would like to point out that a breakthrough dosage of DMT might have a similar subjective effect on your perception in and about your brain.  \n\nAllow yourself to fully recovers physically first and get back to a healthy body state, before trying to fix or mess with your cognitive functions. Whatever was/is affected lungs, heart, throat: let it heal first. \n\nI would recommend plenty of water, nutrients (as in vitamins and minerals), movement and rest. I can\u2019t emphasise the RESTing part enough. \n\nTake your time to sleep well, eat healthy, relax, meditate and move your body every single day for a year. And become conscious about your body mind connection. And if you are still not satisfied with your current mental capacity, you might want to look in some cognition training program. There is plenty material on YouTube and the internet to train your mind. Remembering numbers, IQ-test trainings, jeopardy, who wants to be a millionaire\u2026 \nAnd if you are still unsatisfied with your Memory after 6 weeks of brain practice, you could do some research in to micro dosing. While vaped DMT with a very short duration of 5-15 minutes is probably not the substance of choice. Psilocybin (mushrooms) and LSD could be a thing to research about. Depending on the country and state you live in there are legal substance therapy Centers that could help to provide the right supplement for your needs. \n\nHypnosis, guided Meditation and yoga classes are a non invasive option to unwire your brain salad. Have a serious appointment with yourself first for at least one hour every day for no less than 6 months before thinking about ingesting any external psychoactive substances to solve internal problems. I am sure it will have a very positive effect on you.", "label": 0}

The \"cocktail party effect\" is real, and having gone deaf on that side due to my acoustic neuroma surgery, following conversations in noisy environments is very difficult. \n\nIn hindsight, it is AMAZING what your brain can quietly manage to do, for managing multiple conversations in a loud environment, when both ears are working normally. But lose one of them, and all of a sudden that same environment becomes a muddled noisy mess of somewhat indistinguishable, overlapping conversations, and you can't really follow any of them. \n\nA BAHA (Bone Anchored Hearing Aid) might be helpful for me, but the fact that it needs to be \"installed\" kind of makes it less appealing. Ignoring cost, it doesn't seem like something you can just \"try\".

There\u2019s a [wealth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207008000320) [of](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379412000467) [academic](https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/666656/azu_etd_hr_2021_0133_sip1_m.pdf?sequence=1) [research](https://blakelaw.dev/portfolio/predicting-the-fed/) that shows markets are better at predicting event outcomes than media experts or polls, so it\u2019s important for people to have the opinion of the market available as a piece of information, especially considering how poorly polls have been performing in the era of mass social media. The addition of market data as a competitor to polls and pundits will add another way for people to determine what information is accurate and what isn\u2019t, and hopefully the three will compete and make each other better.\u00a0\n\nThis is also probably a good time to talk about risk and incentive. Because there\u2019s risk attached to the beliefs, the opinions of a market tend to be more accurate. In a survey or poll, and certainly in the media, you can just say anything without consequence. If you\u2019re wrong in a market, though, you lose money, which incentivizes people to be really accurate with their predictions. This is called having \u201cskin the game\u201d--for anyone interested in the concept, read the book of the same title by Nassim Taleb. It\u2019s one of my favorite books of all time and a foundational influence on Kalshi. In today\u2019s media climate, staying informed with real information is getting harder and harder\u2013the fact that people in prediction markets have a financial incentive to be correct makes them much more likely to display accurate information than any other source.\u00a0\n\nI definitely get that people would be worried about the risks and impacts of financializing election outcomes, and we take that very seriously. We have a huge list of people not allowed to trade on Kalshi (campaign staff, donors, etc.) and do extensive screening for illegal trading. \u00a0\n\nAs far as the broader notion that rich people can influence prediction markets by buying up shares of their favorite candidate, so far, this has not happened on Kalshi. We have large market makers on the platform that prevent markets from swinging in one direction too quickly, but even if we didn\u2019t, it\u2019s unclear why anyone would do this in the first place. If you\u2019re a rich person who wants to influence elections, you would just donate to a candidate. Artificially inflating the odds of your preferred candidate doesn\u2019t help them win the election, it\u2019s just a great way to lose money.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I think this is the biggest misconception floating around about prediction markets. **The fact that elections have real consequences is why we should have markets on them, not why we shouldn\u2019t.** Besides providing people with a competing source of information to polls and the media (one where people are financially incentivized to be accurate and truthful), financializing event outcomes makes it possible for people to hedge risk in the event their preferred candidate loses.\u00a0\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you run an import/export company, and one of the candidates is talking about upping tariffs by 200%. That would really hurt your business, so in order to protect yourself, you can place a trade on Kalshi that pays out in the event they get elected. This isn\u2019t just for big businesses, though\u2013let\u2019s say you\u2019re a homeowner in Florida, where hurricane insurance is getting so expensive that it\u2019s breaking the whole insurance market (or a homeowner in California, where fires are doing the same). Your livelihood is at serious risk if one of these events were to happen, and legacy insurance markets aren\u2019t protecting you in this scenario. However, if you were to place a trade on Kalshi predicting that a hurricane or fire would impact your region, you can protect yourself financially from the downside of that event happening.   \n  \nPrediction markets can serve as a type of insurance for people who would suffer the real consequences of events that hurt them, which is really important for economic security & stability. Elections in particular have massive consequences that hinge on their outcome, meaning that we should absolutely have prediction markets dedicated to figuring out who will win them.", "label": 0}

We\u2019re a deeply liquid and fully regulated financial exchange. If you trade stocks or bonds, you can trade event contracts with the same level of trust.\u00a0\n\nAs far as the ethical responsibility of connecting a financial asset to real-world events, we take this very seriously too. We clear every market, including the resolution criteria, with the CFTC before it goes live. A good example of this is the presidential election. There\u2019s a nonzero chance this election is disputed, so to make sure we provided the absolute maximum clarity as far as how the market resolved, we made the choice to keep the market open until inauguration day instead of when the election is called by the media, and to resolve the market from the data of the official US government office of the presidency.", "label": 0}

We made sure to work the CFTC hand-in-hand every step of the way, and made sure our platform was secure from a technical standpoint. We also recently launched deposits via USDC (debit card and Apple Pay coming soon!) to make our platform more accessible to people who don\u2019t have experience doing wires or bank transfers.\u00a0\n\nThere are certainly prediction scenarios that we will never list. For example, markets on whether or not a person will die or not will never be on Kalshi, although they do exist on some other platforms.

Hell some must even know that there\u2019s no current path to a legal status and yet they still try to come, so I doubt it would increase much. Just like harsher policies are unlikely to decrease numbers much, unless you go into real slippery slopes of progressively worse human rights abuses (as some are advocating for and tried or are trying to put in place). And even then many would probably still attempt to immigrate.\nWhen people are desperate for a better life, especially for their children, they seem to be willing to try almost anything, and I can\u2019t say I blame them although I also totally do understand the burden, especially economically, that intaking and integrating large number of migrants can represent.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think blaming the now adult children who didn\u2019t have any control over what happened to them back then is the answer nor do I believe inhumanly forcing someone to return to a now foreign land, if they even can cause some of these kids may not even have a passport or birth certificate from their place of origin (which would technically and unfortunately make them stateless which is yet another terrible situation that isn\u2019t mean to even happen), is the answer.", "label": 0}

In my research on existential crises among older adults and those living with chronic illness, one of the most striking findings is that such deep pain can be difficult to articulate, making it challenging to understand and address.\n\nA key conclusion from my research is the importance of openly discussing concerns about death and the existential fear of disappearance. We all face existential fear to some extent, often rooted in a sense of losing the coherence of who we think we are. Life can be likened to writing a book: when the narrative is disrupted or ends, we confront challenges. For example, your fear of death may arise from the realisation that your book will eventually end, and all of your life stories will come to a close.\n\nThere is no absolute cure for this fear. However, as I mentioned, finding ways to express these existential concerns and empathising with others about their deeper feelings can be immensely helpful.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Hi Vodkarockstoast,\n\nThank you for your questions about care and ageing.\n\nTo your first question, for people without children and for their family carers, planning in advance for care arrangements and decision-making mechanisms is key. Older adults can discuss their care preferences with family members, including preferences for end-of-life care, resources for caregiving, and decision-making mechanisms if they lose mental capacity (such as power of attorney). This approach is similar to advance care planning in response to future health changes; people can outline their wishes to best address their needs during difficult times.\n\nRegarding your second question about caring for an ageing population, many countries are indeed facing health and social care crises, which population ageing can exacerbate. A significant reason for this is that today, older people are primarily cared for in formal settings, such as hospitals or nursing homes, which inevitably depend on public resources. One solution is to explore community-based intergenerational care, where people from different generations support each other in everyday settings. For instance, intergenerational interactions have been shown to benefit older adults\u2019 well-being, and younger people can gain valuable learning from older adults. Many countries are beginning to explore the potential of intergenerational care, which may help address challenges brought about by an ageing population and the care crisis.\n\nFinally, while digital technology and AI may help alleviate caregiving burdens from a practical perspective, they cannot fully replace real human interactions.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Hi FifiJambouree,\n\nThank you for your question.\n\nI have observed differences in coping strategies within the ageing process between people with chronic illness and those who have been healthy. Many people with chronic conditions I've spoken with demonstrate stronger coping strategies, as living with physical limitations, emotional distress, and sometimes social disconnection has been a part of their everyday lives. In other words, coping with chronic conditions has become part of their identity, and they often learn to slow down, reflect, and remain flexible. Additionally, people with chronic illness may be more aware of their limitations and the uncertainties in health and life, which can provide more opportunities to contemplate and reflect on mortality.\n\nConversely, those who have led active and healthy lives may find it more disruptive when confronted with their inevitable mortality, as they may not have had as many opportunities to face health challenges or confront death.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not entirely a matter of healthy people being unable to cope with mortality, it is important for everyone to develop a better understanding of death and dying and to share their feelings with others for support.", "label": 0}

My advice would be to see if you can collaborate with a local university social science department, where an academic may be interested in applying for some funding to co-produce digital technologies for older people. \n\nIf this is not possible, you could contact local community/charity organisations or advertise on social media/newspapers/local forums to recruit and set up a board of trustees/advisory group of older people who could advise, test, and give feedback on digital technology designs and prototypes.

{"text": "Hi dukerustfield, thanks for these comments and reflections from the US. The impact of neoliberalism on healthcare systems in three countries in Europe and the impact on services for older people, is the focus of my recent book *Ageing and the Crisis in Health and Social Care,* [Policy Press | Ageing and the Crisis in Health and Social Care - Global and National Perspectives, By Bethany Simmonds](https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/ageing-and-the-crisis-in-health-and-social-care) \n\nThe fallacy which is argued when discussing privatising health and social care is that it is more efficient and better quality, however, this is not what follows. Instead private companies (particularly) large multinational conglomerates, hollow out organisations, make risky financial decisions, take on large debts, cut costs on staff pay, training, food etc. leading to poorer quality services, and the money which could be reinvested into services are creamed off by shareholders. It creates what I have called 'precarious institutions/systems' which are then bailed out by publicly funded services again (well this is what happens in the UK). Most importantly, those at the receiving end suffer. \n\nWhat I argue is, we need to invest in public and not-for-profit organisations instead and remove for-profits out of services which are low risk (there will always be people who need care) and are not compatible with the concept of 'care'.", "label": 0}

Santa Claus, spiders, snakes, the dark. Clowns traditionally represent laughter, so the horror clown takes that representation and turns it to a fear.\u00a0\n\nLittle children can be fearful of clowns, in as much as we are bigger than life, colorful images to them. Good clowns are sensitive to their audience and can scale back their energy and performance to the situation. Especially one on one, close up encounters. We will get down to their level and let them come to us. Some do it easily, others prefer seeing a clown from a distance. Whatever works for the performer and their audience.\u00a0", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yes and I predict the race is NOT close at all!\nTrump is going to have an Electoral College Landslide!  \n\nThe results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election came as a surprise to nearly everyone who had been following the national and state election polling, which consistently projected Hillary Clinton as defeating Donald Trump. Relying largely on opinion polls, election forecasters put Clinton\u2019s chance of winning at anywhere from 70% to as high as 99%, and pegged her as the heavy favorite to win a number of states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that in the end were taken by Trump.\nHow could the polls have been so wrong about the state of the election?\nThere is a great deal of speculation but no clear answers as to the cause of the disconnect, but there is one point of agreement: Across the board, polls underestimated Trump\u2019s level of support. With few exceptions, the final round of public polling showed Clinton with a lead of 1 to 7 percentage points in the national popular vote. State-level polling was more variable, but there were few instances where polls overstated Trump\u2019s support.\nThe fact that so many forecasts were off-target was particularly notable given the increasingly wide variety of methodologies being tested and reported via the mainstream media and other channels. The traditional telephone polls of recent decades are now joined by increasing numbers of high profile, online probability and nonprobability sample surveys, as well as prediction markets, all of which showed similar errors.\nPollsters don\u2019t have a clear diagnosis yet for the misfires, and it will likely be some time before we know for sure what happened. There are, however, several possible explanations for the misstep that many in the polling community will be talking about in upcoming weeks.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Hi u/oldwoolensweater Your question isn't dumb at all\u2014it's great that you want to understand what to expect. The average age of menopause, defined as a year since a last period, is 51. However, every woman is different, and many experience symptoms well before they stop having periods. During perimenopause, which can start in the late 30s or 40s, she might notice mood changes, brain fog, and increased weight gain around the middle. These symptoms can begin gradually and may appear before significant changes in her menstrual period.  \nessential  \nIt's important to know that perimenopause can last quite a long time, sometimes 10 years or more. One of the most crucial things she can do is work on her sleep quality, as good sleep is esseential for overall health, mood balance, and reducing anxiety. Additionally, perimenopause can be very stressful on relationships, so understanding and support are key during this transition.  \n  \nAlso, many doctors are not fully equipped to manage menopause, so it's really important to find a physician who is an expert in menopause care. This can make a significant difference in managing symptoms and improving quality of life.  \n  \nTo help find a menopause expert, you could start with Evernow, where we have menopause society-certified providers who can be your care partner through peri, menopause, and beyond.  \n[www.evernow.com](http://www.evernow.com/)", "label": 0}

For example in 2020 there were bi-partisan (though I believe all anti-trump) war games with high profile figures like John Podesta where they simulated what might happen in 2020. That topic is interesting to me because they concluded that the most effective simulation for Biden to have won the presidency if he lost the vote was to have the house of reps vote to certify Biden even though he lost the vote. Would that be considered anti-democratic even?

I spent an insane amount of time trying to find good factories and communicate my product ideas to them. I lost tens of thousands investing in bad samples and shitty factories. I thought to myself \u201cthere has to be a better way\u201d. The big fashion houses are making beautiful products. Where are their factories? I began shifting my energy from product design to manufacturing. I did everything I could to find the best factories in the world and started sharing them with other brands.\n\nI figured that if these great factories helped me and my friends\u2019 brands this much, they can help many more. In November 2022, I posted a TikTok video about where Supreme manufactures their hoodies. Overnight, it hit half a million views, and from that point onwards, I never looked back. I made it my mission to find and share all of the best factories in the world. I started traveling year-round and eventually built a team to help me document all of these factories. This year, we surpassed over 1.3M followers across socials. I founded Glass Factory with the mission of changing the manufacturing industry. I have no plan on stopping until all supply chains worldwide are 100% transparent. So far we\u2019ve visited Japan, Turkey, China, Colombia, India, Portugal, Italy and we have many more to come.\n\nLinks:  \n[http://linktr.ee/wlasry](http://linktr.ee/wlasry)\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gjwvgl/im_will_lasry_i_travel_the_world_visiting_luxury/\n\n-----\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Please don\u2019t judge me, it\u2019s a treat I only have once every few years).\n\nI was looking at a newspaper while we ate and chatted (yep, nerd me) and saw the news about the horrors that people who survived the devastation were suffering while being housed in the sports arena - rape, assault, etc. I started crying softly about how awful it was that the people who had just endured so much trauma were now experiencing this additional pain.\n\nAn older gentleman, total stranger, approached our table and politely asked me if I was okay. I nodded. He then proceeded to sternly tell my cousin how it was not right to hurt a woman and make her cry like this (assuming we were BF/GF) \u2026 I don\u2019t remember his exact words. \n\nI thanked him and quickly explained the situation; he understood immediately and apologised for intruding on our conversation, expressed his own sadness over the disaster, tipped his very Texan hat to us and went back to his table, wishing us a good day and good lunch. He was just trying to look out for my safety.\n\nPlease USA, what happened? Please can we bring civility back? \u201cProtectors of Women\u201d don\u2019t rape them or deny them life-saving health care!!\n\nI will never forget you, Kind Stranger. Thank you.

{"text": "Hi u/Content_Butterfly238 Yes, it is possible to get pregnant during perimenopause. During this transition, although menstrual cycles become irregular, ovulation can still occur, making pregnancy possible.  \n  \nIt's difficult to predict exactly when your biological clock has stopped ticking, as perimenopause can last several years, and periods can be sporadic. You have reached menopause when you've gone 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period.  \n  \nRegarding cancer risk during menopause, it's important to be aware that age is a risk factor for many types of cancer. Here are some precautions and recommendations to help reduce your risk: regular screenings, healthy diet, exercise, avoid smoking and limit alcohol, and sun protection.  \n  \nRegular check-ups with a menopause specialized provider (like at Evernow) can help you manage your symptoms and monitor any potential health concerns.", "label": 0}

Even after a woman has stopped menstruating, they may still experience hormone fluctuations, though these will generally be different from the fluctuations before menopause.  \n  \nPost-menopause, the ovaries produce significantly lower levels of estrogen and progesterone, leading to a more stable but lower baseline of these hormones. However, the body can still experience hormonal changes due to factors like stress, lifestyle, and overall health, but they won't be as pronounced as they were before menopause.", "label": 0}

Unlike the gradual transitional of natural menopause, where hormone levels decline slowly over several years, surgical menopause involves a sudden and complete drop in estrogen and progesterone levels due to the removal of the ovaries.  \n  \nManaging surgical menopause often necessitates immediate and more aggressive hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate symptoms and mitigate long-term health risks.  \n  \nI suggest looking into HRT and seeing if it's right for you and your health history. It is an amazing medication that relieves symptoms you're experiencing, like night sweats, brain fog, weight gain, and bad sleep.", "label": 0}

They were very much prohibited from acting further because of the bans - one ER doctor just stood in front of me mournfully repeating \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d over and over. I hear a lot that those of us who couldn\u2019t get medically necessary abortions should sue our doctors, but I disagree with the principle and this really falls apart in my case:\n\nFirst, a doctor shouldn\u2019t have to choose between caring for a patient and committing a crime. The clear solution is to stop criminalizing medical care. \n\nSecond, the State of Texas has declined to clarify how dead we have to be for healthcare and to give clarity to doctors. Ken Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, sued the Biden Administration to be able to deny emergency abortion care within Texas, a lawsuit which he won as detailed in a decision by a Trump-appointed judge.\n\nThird: When a group of us sued Texas with an extremely modest ask of \u201chow dead do we have to be to access a medically necessary abortion?,\u201d Ken Paxton\u2019s response was to look at our cases and say that we weren\u2019t dead enough for an exception, which goes to show that our doctors were right that they couldn\u2019t provide care because of the abortion bans. As a note: on my second emergency room visit, I was heading towards kidney failure. I was so sick that I didn\u2019t return to my pre-pregnancy weight until 7 months pregnant.\n\nFourth: I saw 5 Maternal-Fetal-Medicine ( high risk OB) specialists, 4 OBs, 3 genetic counselors, 3 ER doctors, 5 ultrasound technicians, and countless nurses. So there wasn\u2019t any one who said I was in danger, but not dead enough (and as noted above, the response from the state proved them right).\n\nFinally, my doctor sued Texas with me. We sat in the same room through the Texas Supreme Court hearing on our case. The case where they erased us from their decision and referred only to our lawyers instead. \n\nIn reality, exceptions to abortion bans are a lie.", "label": 0}
