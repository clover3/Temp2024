This is a similar case to that. Some higher up at Pokemon Center projected X amount of demand, got unexpected Y amount of demand that their Z actual stock doesn't last.

{"text": "I'd recommend Scarlet or Legends Arceus, mostly because I don't much care for the exclusive pokemon from Violet. \n\nScarlet and Violet are true open world pokemon games that have you embark on 3 main quests all across the Paldea region, you can see pokemon roaming around the region, and find about 400 different adorable and fierce creatures to add to your party. The characters you meet are also some of my favourites in the series, specifically Arven. Nemona, and Clavell. You're sure to have a unique adventure. It's the pokemon game I dreamed of as a little kid.\n\nLegends Arceus sees you travel back in time and be stranded in the Hisui region, a past form of the Sinnoh region. You get taken in by some kind people in Team Galactic, and be given the quest to help complete the first pokedex (a collection of notes on the pokemon that live in any region). They'll ask you to explore 5 large areas within the region and catalog all the different pokemon in them. You'll also meet some absolutely fantastic characters here, like Adaman, Irida, Volo, and Clayton. This game is more like a standard RPG than the creature collector game that pokemon usually is, but it's a breath of fresh air the series so sorely needed.\n\nThe Let's Go! games are also quite good, though I'd say they're the easiest and most little kid friendly of the bunch. They take place in Kanto, the very first region that was ever in pokemon, and you're taken on an adventure that is very similar to those first games. The main catching mechanic of the game is based on pokemon go, so there won't be any wild battles, you just get to throw pokeballs at wild pokemon. I really enjoyed playing it, but I never finished it, as it just wasn't that challenging.\n\nPokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl take place in the aforementioned Sinnoh region, as they're remakes of the 2006 Diamond and Pearl games. They are faithful to the original, just with updates graphics. It's the most classic pokemon experience you can get on the switch. I am highly biased in liking this game, as it was my first way back when. The rival, champion, and villains are some of the best the series has, and the choice of pokemon you get are also really varied (except fire types, oops, there's only 3 lines you can get...).\n\nPokemon Sword and Shield also exist. I had some fun in my playthrough, yes, but ultimately I'd rather play any of the previously mentioned games. The story is rather bland and predictable, the battles are rather easy, and the characters are not really outstanding in any way (beside our punk queen Marnie of course). It's a very straight forward and railroaded experience, even for a pokemon game. But, it might just be a nice and relaxing first pokemon experience, as it's still a decent game. Plus, every other game you play afterwards is just gonna be better :)\n\n\nHope this helps! If you ever want to complete the pokedex for Scarlet or Violet I'd be more than willing to trade by the way, just shoot me a message.", "label": 0}

Swellow is just a play on Swallows which is more birds. \n\nIn summary, all the route 1 birds are simplist names even the evolved versions are still plays on the bird names they are loosely based on. Talonflame is probably one of the best names of the route 1 birds. So unless that person also hated all the route 1 bird names then their argument is moot.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I would say it depends on how we measure physical strength. Is it in terms of lifting or hitting? \n\nMany Pokedex entries mention that a Pokemon can destroy something with a punch/swipe of its tail/charging etc., but speed obviously also plays a role in this. For example Hitmonchan can punch through a concrete wall, but it probably can't lift much. It's punches are so fast that even a graze leaves a scorch mark, so it's most likely using its speed to punch the hole.>  \nSimilarly Machamp has megaton-punches so his punches are 50 times stronger than the Nagasaki bomb, but he can also punch 500 times a second, so speed plays a factor. He can move mountains with one arm, but is this with a punch or by pushing? In any case it's an incredible feat as a mountain can easily be 1-2+ billion tons.\n\nThen there's the fact that many pokemon can shoot something with incredible force without being pushed back. This would require them to be able to do an equivalent counterpush with their legs. For example Blastoise can shoot through thick steel plates with it's very wide water beams despite only weighing a bit more than 80 kg. This would probably be the equivalent of counter pushing a train driving at you. Its main cannon is even more powerful.\n\nThere are also some Pokemon that are so big that their incredibly strong by default. For example Ting-Lus head is apparently so heavy that even lowering is slowly to the ground would leave a 50m deep crater (this doesn't make much sense, though, as the Pokemon itself is only 700 kg).\n\nA lot have mentioned Regigigas, but his entries are all alledged, so he's out. Even so he'd be outperformed by Melmetal as his alledged entry says that his punch is the most powerful of all Pokemon.\n\nBuzzwole doesn't actually have anything to imply that he is amongst the strongest, plus he steals his strength from other Pokemon, so it's kind of a power.\n\nConkeldurr doesn't seem to have any particular (relatively) impressive feats of strength other than being able to throw his concrete pillars with ease, so he's not in the running for strongest.\n\n\n\nThe strongest in general are probably:\n\nMachamp, Grimmsnarl and Tyranitar.\n\n* Machamp because of the previously mentioned feats (he can also send an enemy flying all the way to the horizon with a punch).\n* Grimmsnarls entry says that with his muscles he can overwhelm even Machamp, so he must be stronger.\n* Tyranitar has the power to make mountains crumble with just one arm, but it's unspecified whether this is through prolonged effort or just one hit. In any case it's incredibly strong.\n\n\n\nIn terms of pure lifting I think Hero Form Palafin has the most impressive feat of strength as it says he can easily lift a cruise ship with one fin. A cruise ship could potentially be more than 200,000 tons \n\nOther much less impressive, but still very heavy lifts include:\n\n* Heracross can easily lift (and throw) 100 times its own weight, so about 5,4 tons easily. In megafrom it can do 500 times its own weight, so around 31 tons.\n* Tapu Bulu can uproot large trees and use them as clubs. A heavy tree could be anywhere between 1-10 tons or more.\n* Mudsdale can carry a load of 10 tons for extended periods of time, but it's a bit unclear whether it's on its back or in a wagon.\n* Braviary can lift a car while flying.\n\n\n\nSome impressive abilities where speed might play a factor:\n\n* Rhydon can topple a building with his tail, Nidoking can snap a telephone pole like a matchstick with his.\n* Terrakion can charge through a giant castle wall, Rampardos can topple a skyscraper with his charge and Bouffalant can derail a train with a headbutt.\n* Buzzwole, Pangoro and Darmanitan can destroy a dump truck with a single hit. Mudsdale can do the same with a kick.\n* Armaldo can punch through a steel slab and Carracosta can slap a hole in a tanker. As mentioned Hitmonchan can punch through a concrete wall.\n* Hariyama can send a 10-ton truck flying with a punch and it can stop a moving train with a slap.\n* Walrein can shatter 10 tons blocks of ice with a single blow from his tusks.\n* Sawk's karate chops can cleave the ocean (from the wind pressure I assume).", "label": 0}
