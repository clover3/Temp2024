I am a Ringling Barnum and Bailey Clown College graduate, I worked on the show for many years eventually becoming a producing clown.

It is the only museum that is singularly devoted to celebrating the greatest clowns on earth and houses the largest collection of clown artifacts in the world.

In March 2023, I (alongside four other patients and two doctors) [sued Texas](https://reproductiverights.org/case/zurawski-v-texas-abortion-emergency-exceptions/zurawski-v-texas/) over the abortion bans after being denied an abortion of an unviable twin, which would have protected me and our viable twin.\n\nI was one of the women featured in the Diane Sawyer and Rachel Scott documentary, [On the Brink](https://www.hulu.com/series/impact-x-nightline-on-the-brink-6908932d-1ba7-46ec-84d9-499cfcdf8e28?dl=false), and a more in-depth look at our case was the subject of the recently-released documentary, Zurawski v Texas. I kept a journal logging my experience in real time, a small selection of which was published in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/19/diary-woman-fled-texas-for-abortion).\n\nIn short: I was severely ill with hyperemesis gravidarum (heading towards kidney failure) due to a twin pregnancy. At 13 weeks, we found out that one of our twins would not survive. Despite additional ultrasounds, testing, and ending up in the ER for a second time, I was not dead enough for an abortion in Texas to preserve my health and the life of our healthy twin (that is even what the State of Texas said in response to our lawsuit). My husband and I had to go to Colorado so I could get a single fetal abortion. Thanks to my abortion, I delivered our healthy twin in March 2023, two weeks after we filed our case.\n\nI have submitted and/or told my story under oath multiple times. I have also testified before the [House Ways and Means](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DACQf3uyflJ/?igsh=MXF2cnlrcG1wc2w4MA==)Committee and the [Senate Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/crossing-the-line-abortion-bans-and-interstate-travel-for-care-after-dobbs) Committee.\n\nAMA!\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1giydzi/i_am_one_of_the_first_women_to_sue_texas_over_the/\n\n-----\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
