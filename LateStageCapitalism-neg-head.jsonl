But it is also a warning. A daunting gulf still remains between the magnitude of the systemic challenge and the scope and scale of the responses that are being conceived and proposed, and (partially) enacted \u2013 a gulf from which new monsters will continue to emerge.\n\n>Over the last few years we have seen the beginnings of welcome action in the face of the crisis. Some good things are being done, and action is being taken \u2014 by the standards of recent decades, fairly significant action. New directions on trade policy, industrial strategy, manufacturing capacity, labor force unionization rates, and climate change all mark a significant departure from the past forty years of U.S. government policy and practice. Yet this is where the danger lies: in the comforting illusion that we are finally making progress, that \u2014 after decades of misdirection, obfuscation, and inaction \u2014 we are at last awakening to the magnitude of the crisis. The bigger picture, unfortunately, is that we are still losing \u2014 and losing badly \u2014 in our struggle to tackle long-run negative political-economic trends. We have only just begun walking tentatively up a fast-moving downward escalator, suggesting that further systemic shocks are in store.\n\nDirect link to PDF:\n\n[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6644f8546111dd1995df44eb/t/67056e835532bd7f8a548185/1728409220752/Index-of-Systemic-Trends-rd1-7.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6644f8546111dd1995df44eb/t/67056e835532bd7f8a548185/1728409220752/Index-of-Systemic-Trends-rd1-7.pdf)", "label": 0}

In the exact same thread as which the \"objectively better\" candidate refuses to endorse anything objectively better, in a vain attempt to attract Trump supporters.\n\nThere are a thousand and one ways for Harris to not make this a coinflip election. It doesn't have to be anything like increasing the minimum wage to 26$, or invading Israel, or universal health care. It could as performative and simple as bringing a few more Palestinian and Lebanese refugees into the country and helping them in a great show of care, displaying the proposed legislative bill to increase wages to 15$, actually talking about health care for the most needy. She has not, and will not even go that little quarter inch.\n\nShe will sooner lose and throw every last American under the Trump bus before changing her right wing goals of more fracking! More border walls and human rights abuses! More conflict! More chasing after the affection of the Dick Cheneys and Melonis of the world! More trade wars! More climate destruction! More great power buildup for the showdown to World War 3!\n\nAll of these things are guaranteed to accelerate the worsening of life in America. Much much much worse. Here's an exercise, try looking up all the War on Terror veterans who have entered politics and how they have fucked us all!\n\nAll of this leaves more desperate people willing to listen to the revolutionary rhetoric (and lies) of fascists over time. Leading to the exact same place that Trump would. \n\nAnd your only response will be \"but third party voters! They're responsible for this!!! you're an accelerationist!\" because you refuse to understand the domestic consequences of America's foreign and global policies under the duopoly. You refuse to even entertain the thought about how your \"objectively better\" candidate will give the election to Trump before changing her course.\n\nDespite all you have seen and heard, you still obey your ingrained American propaganda and blame and despise the few people with consciences more than the holy and powerful capitalist politicians above us all. You still think that the DNC would ever allow even the slightest bit of socialism despite the court cases of 2016, you still think that they will listen to the people when they are on track to lose to Trump before changing their policies, you still think that their (bipartisan) support of gross inhumanity in Asia and the Middle East and South America will one day translate into benevolence at home despite how that has never worked out. \n\nWe know what has to be done to change this and how it will have to be fought.

If I was allowed to write her name with glitter, sparkles, and fireworks I absolutely would.\n\nThe sad fact is that our political spectrum has been steadily shifting towards the right by both parties. Unfortunately, the Liberals tend to follow the whims of the Democratic party and are becoming more conservative.\n\nKamala Harris has already put trans and Arab people on the chopping block. One group is because she's a fascist and evil and the other one to appease her new Republican allies.\n\nThe sad fact of the matter is that even if Trump loses this election, we're still fucked because Democrats are planting the seeds for a more intelligent and formidable Republican adversary. \n\nTrump is a moron and an imbecile. He's easy to predict, detect, and thus thwart. \n\nI'm not sure how old Dick Chaney is, but what if he runs next cycle? He'll might very likely win because the Democrats will try to use the same tired Pied Piper scheme and voter shaming while still producing 0 advantageous policies aside from crumbs and many people will choose to stay home.\n\nAgain for the liberals here, I'm not choosing their platform or tactics. I'm not making them support genocide. Genocide was wrong when Hitler, Christopher Columbus, and Andrew Jackson were doing it. It's still wrong when Biden and Kamala Harris is doing it.\n\nI'm not compromising my values as a human being just so I can just fall in line. I wouldn't be able to live with myself.\n\nTrump is a piece of shit no doubt, but the reason why we got him in the first place was because Hillary told the media to elevate him as a candidate.\n\nThe sad fact is that so many people only care about the suffering of marginalized people when the Republicans do it. The kids are still in cages. Have we heard anything about it since Biden has been in office? No one cares anymore. \n\nLiberals have compromised their morals so far to the point where overt genocide and criminalizing homeless people aren't even a deal breaker. These things aren't wrong unless Trump does it, but it's otherwise okay and acceptable.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I live in an area that has some of the highest housing cost increases in the country. Homelessness was very minimal 10 years ago, now there are 2-5 thousand in my immediate area at any one time living on the street and in their cars. Local governments have an annual point in time count that sees this rise year after year. A few dozen people live within a couple blocks of me on the street and somewhat out of view, and I've gotten to slightly know a couple through donating a few bucks regularly and supplies to them occasionally. It's an extremely difficult cycle to get out of, and nowhere near enough help, or the right kind of help.\n\nIt's a solidly blue/democratic area, with close GOP rural support. Neither party has been able to do anything to stop the increase. Attempts so far made are regular encampment sweeps, throwing them in jail, and increasing housing supply that in one of the highest housing cost areas in the nation end up unaffordable for even employed poor people. A 200-300 person tiny home village has been attempted, but faced pushback from of course R politicians, but some D's as well, along with many local homeowners who use environmentalism as an excuse for nimbyism. Those groups are relatively well funded through local businesses and homeowners. Even if built, which luckily after 2 years looks like ground is being broke while other lawsuits await, will only serve a small fraction of those living on the street. It's another bandaid, albeit a better one.\n\nHomelessness IMO, is not a problem capitalism can solve. There are to many systemic issues involved with increasing homelessness, not the least of which is that it's impossible to profitize the homeless. So those who are also now economically hurting (employed, housed taxpayers) foot the bill because taxes are unable to be levied to a large degree on the rich and corporations. Keeping solutions localized will also forever render them unsolvable, as local governments strain to keep up with inflation and funding other big issues like education, roads, housing for even just the middle class, a century of built up environmental issues, commerce, etc.", "label": 0}

Certain people had \"privilege\" to deny service in the argument of dedicating their lives to study the Torah; they were given \"spiritual leader\" exceptions.  NOW, the police are beating them, and they are ending those exceptions.  My point is, the government is making it harder and harder to avoid military service.  Even Women must serve.

If the US went on a war footing, it could  overwhelm Iran given the time to set up the several divisions and entire marine corps required to make a successful invasion. Which Iran would be throwing everything it had to hamper American staging areas in the area. Because there be no hiding mobilizing everything they have. And closing off the strait of hormuz. \n\n But it would take the entire standing US military to occupy Iran and conscription to be able to rotate out. And it would come at a very high cost. Iran being 4 times larger than Iraq with 4x the population and a huge amount of mountainous terrain. That's not happening without major consequences that I doubt the US public would be willing to absorb. \n\nTldr, madness indeed.", "label": 0}

They are fighting insurgencies and can call in airstrikes as needed. I don't know how many American soldiers would hold up to conventional warfare against a country like China.\n\nI remember reading an article not too long after Russia invaded Ukraine where they talked to an American soldier who went to Ukraine to volunteer. They had done multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan but were leaving Ukraine after a few weeks. They couldn't handle the constant artillery bombardment and not having air superiority.\n\nWhen it comes to China, I also don't think the American people could handle the economic impact of a war. So many Americans are pampered, spoiled babies. They lost their shit with the supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic. That disruption would be a picnic in comparison.\n\nWhen it comes to Iran you're probably right, but if you look at the Millennium Challenge 2002 for example, it seems like it would really depend on how each side played it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "See how you point to a plane and say look how good the planes are?   Here's the issue with that.  Planes don't get in dogfights like the red baron anymore.  Its not about whether or not your plane is better than that plane.  Because something exists called air-to-air missiles.  Like the R-37 or the Kinzhal.  A fact of modern warfare is that a missile is much more direct and to the point instrument than a plane.  It doesn't have wings, and its powered by a rocket, not a jet engine.  So these missiles are as good at hitting planes as a plane is at hitting a boat.  Its just a better tool for the job.  These missiles can go mach 6+, and our fastest planes human kind knows how to make only go a little over mach 1.  That's why its a sight to see a plane break the sound barrier and cause a sonic boom, cuz it can just barely do that.  You're watching a plane at full speed when that happens.  So its mach 6 vs mach 1, missile vs plane.  Your plane being 20% better than their planes doesn't make it dodge missiles.  So it really isn't going to turn the tide.  You can't achieve air superiority unless you can get your planes in and out and control the skies.", "label": 0}

But that\u2019s kind of the entire US doctrine, fight with overwhelming firepower. It\u2019s been that way since WW2.

The US doesn\u2019t go into a fight they think would be fair, militarily that\u2019s just dumb, you want the odds and firepower stacked in your favor. You don\u2019t spend almost a trillion dollars on the military and not get overwhelming firepower capability in return. \nAs for Millennium Challenge, that exercise was interesting. The simulated Iranians were able to cause incredible damage. But there were some notable inconstancies. The 2 that stand out the most to me was that \u201cIran\u201d used missile boats that literally couldn\u2019t not carry the anti ship missiles used in the simulation.

{"text": "My friend you are right that anti air missiles exist and are cheaper than pilots and aircraft. But you don\u2019t account for a few things. To shoot a plane down with a missile, you first have to \u201csee\u201d said plane which can be difficult with stealth tech that the US and its allies use. Radars have trouble seeing the Western aircraft. This can be a problem because the first mission the US would fly against an Iran, Russia, etc would be SEAD. These missions whole purpose is to destroy anti air radars and missile launch sites and is a proven strategy historically. \nThen we come to the part about which planes are better. We can also point to the Wests advantage is sensor packages, stealth technology, engine capability, pilot experience and training. You said that it\u2019s about getting your planes in and out, something the West has designed their airframes for. First you send in the advanced stealth jets and attack the enemies AA capability, then you send in the older non stealth jets to bomb with relative impunity. Obviously though this is describing a war scenario, things can be unpredictable. But at the moment the west has more airframes that are more than capable of dealing with Irans anti air network and air forces.", "label": 0}
