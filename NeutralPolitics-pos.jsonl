Furthermore USA and Israel are allies for various reasons.\n\nThis leads to following:\n\n1. Why spend more when you don\u2019t have to? USA has a vested interest in the region and is willing to support israel. They can provide/lend/sell at discount various equipment at favorable conditions any time. Israel takes advantage of that because it makes financial sense. Note that this is not unique to Israel: USA has a huge military (more gdp than next x countries put together). It uses that military to do a lot of power projection and protection of its overseas assets/friends. \n2. USA provides unique abilities. Israel is not quite in a war with Iran. They are instead in a weird state of throwing missiles at each other.  USA can help here at least with shooting down missiles which is hard to in general. No other country can help here as much as USA*, and you generally can\u2019t buy that kind of help with money.\n3. Buying military equipment is very country specific. You can\u2019t just buy your way into it, plus timing can very long. In Israel example they don\u2019t want weapons 8 years from now, they want them now.\n\nThis is all very general info though, broad overview", "label": 1}

{"text": "Dude you\u2019re not really relying to what I\u2019m saying and you\u2019re kinda ranting about stuff here I\u2019m not even talking about and also what sources are you needing the literal charts from FRED showing you that you\u2019re wrong about corporate tax revenues they DID decrease after the TCJA and that percent of GDP being tax revenues didn\u2019t increase significantly until 2021 well after the TCJA also the NBER itself disagreeing with your analysis?\n\n\nI never made any reference to job losses or gains from the effect of Covid we all know those numbers are dramatically skewed what I was saying is once we did rebound we started hovering around 6 percent and this is when the government passed their budget reconciliation the same way republicans passed their legislation with the TCJA. You also seem to be missing that a large amount of the spending came from trumps administration that is when we see inflation start rising now did Biden\u2019s admin do more than was needed ? Obviously that can be argued and I don\u2019t disagree there but no one here is arguing that point I merely said why they may have still seen it necessary and it\u2019s also what the people wanted they were just slightly heavy handed as is usual with the government but like I mentioned don\u2019t forget a large amount of the spending was from trumps spending as well it\u2019s just a fact.\n\nYou contradict yourself here in your second paragraph you argue about the timing but you just said yourself this was an artificial recession due to shutdowns and \u201ceveryone\u201d knew there would be a quick turnaround so why would the trump administration pass a ton of money knowing with how quick the economy was gonna rebound due to the artificial recession and cause a ton of inflation? Remember inflation began increasing directly following Trump admin spending and continued into Biden\u2019s admin yet you speak as if only Biden\u2019s admin is in the wrong for the inflation? You then mention the timing of the TCJA which was at an objectively great point was good due to some specific indicators but it specifically disagrees with you on what you said about the 1964 tax cuts which don\u2019t support the TCJA we already had extremely low unemployment so let\u2019s lower it slightly more by cutting taxes when we don\u2019t need to and aren\u2019t in recession? Compared to the 1964 tax cuts where they definitely did not already have near record low unemployment rate.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what claims about Keynesian I\u2019m making that you need sources for I didn\u2019t make any claims besides saying Kennedy got the idea for the tax cuts and defecit spending from a Keynesian economist is that what you need a source for? Besides that I described how Keynesian economics works you spend in defecit to help growth when needed and you shrink deficits when the economy is doing good. I\u2019m not really gonna respond to your discussion on Medicaid and 1970s inflation I believe that\u2019s outside the scope of the conversation I\u2019m just gonna say you phrased the 1964 acts as great policy in relation to the TCJA but when I bring up the economic principles behind it now you are phrasing it in a bad light due to various things from the 1970s onward so we\u2019re those cuts bad or good policy? \n\nYour final paragraph you seem to arguing as if I disagree that cutting taxes leads to economic growth but that\u2019s not my point I DO agree that tax cuts especially corporate tax cuts can and do lead to increased economic prosperity however they also can and do result in less revenue which can create defecits \n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FCTAX\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD\n\nI don\u2019t know what numbers you look at but the NBER disagrees with you and all these charts show less corporate revenue and larger deficits since 2018 TCJA and my main point here is that you attribute the 19 percent number of gdp that tax revenues were in 2022 to the TCJA but those numbers didn\u2019t jump like that until after the Covid recession so a full two years of the TCJA did not result in that number increasing.\n\nI forgot you said one more thing about democrats versus republicans I am trying to be non biased hence why I\u2019m trying to stick to numbers but I will acknowledge I\u2019m biased and it\u2019s annoying? I guess to see the argument that the TCJA was the great amazing choice for the time but all decisions democrats made were bad when both admins caused this inflation and according to economic policy that led to the 1960s record low unemployment rate would not agree with the TCJA being a good idea because increasing deficits kn good times restricts how much you can increase the defecit further in bad economic times. And then you blame democrats for not negotiating ? We both know the republicans entire legislative goal was to block literally anything Obama wanted or tried to die and McConnell is on record saying that however once again that\u2019s outside the scope. Ultimately could I agree that the TCJA slightly boosted some numbers such as NBER saying we got 11 percent more corporate investment and could this had led to slightly lower unemployment when it was already really low? Sure I\u2019ve never disagreed with that but it wasn\u2019t smart policy and wasn\u2019t necessary in a time where the economy is doing great.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Just intuitively, you don't need to have a major effect on Trump's committed voters to have a major effect on a USA presidential election, because of a couple factors:\n\n- votor turnout is consistently low.\n\n- presidential victory means victory in the electoral college, which is consistently decided by only a few swing states, in which the margins are often slim.\n\n- there is a body within the electorate who are weakly attached to any political party and indeed the idea of voting.\n\nFor example, imagine a candidate made the news the day before the election for praising in detail a really unpopular local mayor in Georgia, who actively makes their constituents' lives miserable (the mechanism for this is irrelevant; it's just a hypothetical): now a politically-apathetic/agnostic chunk of that mayor's city receives a kneejerk revulsion towards the candidate, which motivates them to get to the polling station out of spite, but the rest of the country (and even much of the rest of the state) really don't give a damn. \n\nThis wouldn't affect the national polling average at all, and would be a rounding error in the popular vote results. And yet, in 2020 Georgia's 16 electors were decided by just 12,000 votes: that 'rounding error' news story just caused a swing of 32 electoral college votes, over 10% of the winning candidate's expected total. \n\n---\n\nThis part is pure opinion, but I think this magnifies the polling errors for Trump in particular, because, to use mdoern parlance, he's such a yapper. I don't believe it's a controversial take to say that Trump just loves to throw so many different claims and ideas out into the world, which makes him more vulnerable to that kind of extremely localised voter swing, in either direction, simply due to the quantity of material which he produces.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Hi. \n\nYes, I remember. Thanks for resubmitting. Our submission rules are pretty extensive and have a lot to do with syntax, so let's go through this version and see if we can adjust it to fit.\n\nI'd begin by eliminating the entire first paragraph. I know that's rough, but the best way you can ensure neutrality under Rule B is to say *nothing* about your political position or background. On top of that, entering a forum full of political and policy wonks by saying you've never voted and never will is going to cause a lot of potential respondents to dismiss you as unserious from the outset, so despite your intent, you'll actually bias the responses with this introduction.\n\nInstead, start here:\n\n> There's a considerable number of men who have voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 that men have now become conservative. \n\nSince this is phrased as a factual claim, it needs a source. Setting aside for a moment the source in the next sentence, the reason it needs its own is because the assertion that the men have \"become conservative\" is not the same thing as them voting for Donald Trump. There's a strong argument that Donald Trump is not a conservative and that those men don't hold beliefs traditionally associated with political conservatism. So, the statement would either need to be reworded to say \"become supporters of Donald Trump\" or it would need its own source to support the \"become conservative\" claim.\n\n> Here is a YouTube video...\n\nThe [source requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) of this subreddit say that video or audio may not be used as the primary or exclusive source, but can be included if accompanied by a link to an official transcript or an article describing the content. So, you'd need a text source or sources for all the factual information in this paragraph. If you want to include the video as well, you may, but it would need an accompanying transcript or article. The presumption should be that nobody will watch the video.\n\n> I think there are other factors at play besides just abortion and economy as the main issues, but I'll make a separate post about that. \n\nYou can leave this out. r/NeutralPolitics is a strictly evidence-based forum. What OP thinks might be in play are not relevant.\n\n> But as the election results start to come in, I wanted to ask what everyone else thinks about his subject.\n\nRephrase this to be a specific question that's not asking for personal opinion (Rule A). Something like this would work:\n\nWhat evidence exists to explain this shift of men towards Donald Trump?\n\nI know that all seems like a lot, but beyond finding the source, the four edits to the text are relatively simple.

I personally never want the amount of help I do or do not deserve to be measured by how many other men are successful. Whether or not I need help should be about how much I as an individual need help. Turning this into a gendered or racial issue means ignoring men who need help just because men as a class are doing well.

I said the right runs on culture war issues because they have no policy, and most americans don't understand policy so its easier to identify with random culture war bullshit. i don't need bias or bigotry to get that. You are the one stating that there is bias and bigotry... YOU STATED DEMOCRATS ARE BIASED AND BIGOTED AGAINST MEN? WHy are you projecting???", "label": 1}
