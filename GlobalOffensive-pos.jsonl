{"text": "Stop looking at the crosshair. Because of your \"warmup\" routine, you're probably always focused on it. When you die in a real game because you're looking at your crosshair, you should try to learn to aim with your hand instead. Don\u2019t focus on where you want to aim; just to adjust the crosshair position accordingly.\n\nThe easiest way for you to warm up will probably be to turn off your crosshair using a console command.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Here\u2019s a refined version of your feedback to improve clarity and grammar:\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nI watched the demo of your last Dust2 game, and you definitely deserve this ELO. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\n\n1. Lack of Strategic Thinking: It feels like you\u2019re playing solely based on your teammates' info, without your own analysis.\n\n2. Low Awareness: It seems like you\u2019re playing without proper sound or radar awareness, as if you're not using a headset or even glancing at the radar.\n\n3. Inconsistent Aim: Your aim is shaky, lacking precision at long ranges, likely due to high sensitivity.\n\n4. Positioning Issues: You stay too close to walls when holding and peeking, compromising your field of view. (biggest problem in npc elo)\n\n5. Poor Choice of Spots: You tend to die in shit tier spots while ignoring god tier positions.\n\n6. Overly Passive Play: You seem too afraid to play aggressively, making your playstyle overly passive - \"Plz gaben give me a good team to get carried\" .\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to fix each issue:\n\n\n\n1. Strategic Thinking: Ensure your radar displays the full map so you can see your teammates\u2019 positions. This helps you predict enemy locations. In NPC ELO, consider binding a toggle for \\`voice\\_enable 0\\` during clutch situations to focus on your own thinking. Listening to teammates' callouts in npc's ELO often provides inaccurate info.\n\n   \n\n2. Awareness: Always check where your teammates are holding, so you can infer enemy positions. If you aim to climb out of this npc ELO, try going \\`voice\\_enable 0\\` for an entire game to rely on your awareness and learn through personal experience.\n\n\n\n3. Aim Adjustment: Increase your crosshair size by at least 1.5x. This helps with aim, especially at no aim elo, where having visible crosshair lines is essential. Lower your sensitivity to improve micro-precision, especially in long-range fights (e.g., from midtob to longcar in Dust2). Adjusting sensitivity may take a days to get used to, but playing 10 games daily will help you adapt.\n\n\n\n4. Positioning: Avoid staying too close to walls when holding or peeking. When peeking from a wall, half your screen is blocked, while the enemy can see half your body. Keeping your distance improves your view and gives you an advantage. (biggest problem with silvers)\n\n\n\n5. Spot Choice: Every map has god and shit tier spots. Dust2 is a great map to start with. For example, if it's a 4v2, and you know enemies are on short, don\u2019t instantly rotate to A. Let your teammates rotate through CT or short to support you, instead of pushing and risking an 3v2 situation.\n\n\n\n6. Aggression and Decision Making: Radar info is everything on Dust2. If you see teammates pushing long or taking a site, don\u2019t waste time throwing nades or being overly cautious. Push in and flank, even if it means dying. Your passive T-side play indicates you\u2019re relying too much on your teammates(plz carry me). Why do you think they give the first 15 seconds of each round? To buy? No, it\u2019s actually for planning your strats for the next 30 seconds, based on your spawn location. For example, if you spawn near tunnel while teammates spawn closer to long, consider faking B with a fake b door smoke, then rotating to lower to flank short. While the guy\u2019s brain.exe is overheating as he wonders what's happening while shitting in B, you'll be able to take A more easily.\n\n\n\n7. Utility: Focus on mastering just three smokes for Dust2 at this ELO\u2014B door, short box, and long default CT. These are all you need nothing more. On CT side, only worry about using a molly if you spawn near long. Don\u2019t use nades when pushing solo, as this tells your enemy - \"hello i am here free kill to you\".\n\n\n\nLastly, remember that even a simple fake smoke can shift the enemy\u2019s positioning. For example, if your team pushes long, the enemy often rotates to A, leaving B clear. If your team pushes mid to B fast, an enemy previously holding long may push, granting a free kill if you\u2019re in the right spot.\n\n\n\nNPC's Elo < 15k", "label": 1}
