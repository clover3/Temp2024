I think a community of 20-25 with 10 or so medium/hardcore accounts could get the first one done barely and the rest smoothly. I think 15 or maybe even as low as 10 super super juiced co-ordinated accounts who figure out how best to use support moves could pull it off.\n\nAfter a couple more powerful 'mons come out, this post will look stupid and we'll see 4 mans.

You probably invested everything you had into those Dmax pokemon, while other players might have invested most resources into PVP, others into raid counters.\n\nFor some people, they simply might not have enough resources for those specific Dmax pokemon.

If you only have 200 Charmander candy, 125 go for the evos alone, the rest of the candies either go into powering up, or to max moves, as you can't really do both.\n\nTo add to this, most Dmax pokemon released so far have had Comm Days, so, many players don't find it worth evolving them without getting their exclusive moves. And this is ignoring IVs, because that's another criteria people have to justify such investment.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you want to build a proper team of 3 for each current Gmax, you'll need to essentially invest in 9 different pokemon, all of them requiring 125 candies to evolve (1125 candies), while each requires 248 candies (2232 candies) and 225k stardust (2,025M stardust) to reach level 40. Then you have the Max moves to level up, which cost 120 XLs (150 for Metagross) and 400 candies (500 for Metagross) to max all 3 moves, which you have to multiply by 9 again.\n\nLets not pretend that it's as simple as some of you are implying.", "label": 0}
