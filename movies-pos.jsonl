{"text": "None of that gets you to being able to defeat a trained Sith Lord. I am supposed believe that a wounded, distracted Palpatine would lose to a simple staff wielder? Again, you only need to look toward the established lore, seen in the movies, that tells us about how practioners of the dark side deal with pain/suffering. It doesn't hold them back, it makes them more powerful. Ignoring lore just invalidates your argument. \n\nAnd don't play that anti woman Jedi shit with me. I am a lifetime fan of the Star Wars EU, which has several notable female jedi, all of whom are nowhere near Mary Sues -- Bastilla Shan, Nomi Sunrider, Ahsoka Tano, and so much more. Naomi Sunrider and the Dark Woman in particular are two of my favorite characters in fiction. Don't make me go full star wars nerd on your ass. \n\nWhat is it with you folks? Every single argument defending Rey comes down to \"she had struggles too! Luke is a Mary sue! You just hate women!\". Like dude, it has nothing to do with hating women, seriously.  Rey is an insult to actual compellingly written female characters. \n\nMaybe you need a refresher course. Rey's first use of the force was a jedi mind trick-- something she had no concept of until the plot decided she needed it. Meanwhile Luke had no concept of the force til he met Obi Wan. And when he was training with Obi Wan, it took him a few tries before he could block blaster bolts, blindfolded. Rey utilized the force perfectly on the first try by mind tricking stormtroopers, even though she had no concept of the force and force abilities at that point.\n\nRey can pilot the millennium falcon despite having absolutely no flying experience whatsoever.  Luke can pilot an xwing because he actually has flying experience and due to the fact of the similar flight controls of the xwing and his T16 airship. \n\nWhat exact struggles did Rey have? What complications did she experience that taught her important lessons and elevated her as a character? Rey off the bat is a skilled fighter, able to easily subdue her enemies, mind trick stormtroopers, and defeat a trained Sith in battle. The best thing Luke did in his 1st film was destroy the death star. He struggled with using the force, nearly killed himself in the xwing, almost got his ass kicked in the cantina.  When you take a wider view of the film, for the most part Luke fails more than he succeeds. \n\nRey in her second film goes against Luke's orders to save her friends, and guess what? She saves them, the resistance, fights Kylo Ren again, to a standstill (despite him being the superior duelist)  all with little to no injury or complication. Luke disobeys Yoda and obi wan and loses his right hand. Luke was forced to learn a powerful lesson about preparedness, caution, and being mindful of his fears. \n\n\nI won't go any further. No need. Rey succeeds far more than she fails; her arc can be summarized as someone trying to figure out their place in life -- and pretty much being handed over the answers with no real struggle or hardship. That's not a compelling character at all.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The level of rage this guy is exhibiting about a 20 year old trilogy is puzzling, but more creepy than anything.\n\nIf you want to chat about the subject, i'd be happy to.  \nI think people need to stop thinking of movies based on books as \"just the book, but visualized.\" That's disregarding the nature of the medium. I used to be more of a purist; for example I remember being pretty irritated over Jackson's changes and additions to the films. But over time I have come to realize a book and a film can simply be kept and seen as completely separate entities. If the film captures the spirit of the book-- keeping the critical messages and themes intact\u2014it's doing a decent job. But what real worth is a film that so replicates a book that every detail is presented in exactly the same way? If I want the book, I read the book. It will do a far better job of \"being the book\" than any movie can. The written word is a completely different art form that uses different techniques to connect the audience to emotion, story, and experience.  \nBut a film that is made to be a distinct experience from its parent property is worthwhile.\n\nThe most literal film adaptations I have ever seen have taken amazing narration from the book and turned them into narration from the main character in the movie. You can't film the narrator's train of thought so let's just have the main character actually narrate off screen! *Stand by Me* did this a little, not that it's a bad film, but it's a cheap and easy way to get the magic of the book on screen. All they're doing is *reading text from the book within the movie*.  One of my film teachers proclaimed this was the height of lazy film making.\n\nThe absolute best film you can make about Middle Earth will *not* be the line by line visualization of the books.  A film will be an interpretation of the book, not simply the book visualized. Otherwise, you only get a mediocre film that doesn't have much reason to exist, except to appease the people who don't bother to read. Film is a medium with its own strengths and weaknesses, and those strengths and weaknesses are completely different to those of a painting, or a novel, or a poem. A good director knows how to play to film's strengths.\n\nThat said, I don't like what Peter Jackson did, though I don't hate the films as a whole. But I also don't think Tolkien's talent was in crafting a literary work, so much as world-building, language, and lore. *The Hobbit* is far more enchanting, to me than *Lord of the Rings,* which at times made me feel like I was reading the Judeo-Christian Bible. I didn't even bother watching his Hobbit trilogy, because I didn't feel it likely he captured the soul of the book. I much prefer the animated version from Rankin Bass!", "label": 1}

{"text": "just to add, on the topic of the hobbit, there is a fan edit (communal effort) that cuts the trilogy down to a couple of hours. i still couldnt get through it (it's rare i dont finish a movie, for context,) but if you were to ever have the urge to watch the hobbit films- that would probably be a more palletable option.

{"text": "I am drawing such a complete blank on good film adaptations, though I know there have been some which I truly loved.  \nI really should try LOTR again, but I read a lot less these days due to mental health, and have so much waiting for me. I know I may not have given Tolkien the credit he is due; for one, his style is very different to what I like. I tend towards stories that have a close-up focus on the inner workings of individuals and relationships, whereas Tolkien wrote in the epic style. His focus is more on events, but he was setting out to create a mythic British history. The epic is not something that resonates with me in general. However, the lore, the world, the inventiveness are all things I appreciate.\n\nI thought of one movie made from a beloved book that changed quite a lot, yet works as a standalone movie, and that's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.*\n\nThe book is a masterpiece, and probably the one book I'd take with me if I had to leave Earth in a hurry. So it's hard for me to acknowledge a film which kind of guts and remodels it for a lesser product. So I wouldn't call the movie a masterpiece, but it works, and does a decent job of capturing the soul of the books (partially, anyway; the happy ending was a misstep imo). I think a former version of myself might have loathed it for the extreme changes it makes , but a more relaxed TLK says, \"Hey, it was fun, and it doesn't take away from the book.\" Ultimately it can't harm the book. The book is immutable. Definitely superior, but I still enjoyed the movie for what it was.\n\n*Jaws* is definitely one where the film excels as its own entity.\n\nI am also on the side of Kubrick when it comes to *The Shining,* but I don't like Stephen King in the first place, and really enjoy watching Kubrick's version over and over.\n\nI am sure later a few better examples will pop into my head.", "label": 1}

You can see in that film just how bad it is for the Army to be deployed on U.S. soil, in fucking New York of all places, even without dropping bombs or firing a shot, so you'd think people would think \"hmm, maybe we shouldn't invade a foreign country because this is what will happen, but worse, much fucking worse\".", "label": 1}

Here is why I like the movie.\n\n# \"Traditional Marriage versus Hollywood\" RomCom\n\n**Monkey see, monkey do.** Romantic Hollywood movies only frame the honeymoon phase of a relationship. This makes women seek new relationships for the sake of living closer to the reality of those movies. Why fix what you have, when you could have more, when you could have another first date (epitome of this is \"50 First Dates\")? \n\nThis is a criticism men have with romantic movies and I think it is at least a bit valid because there is at least one crazy woman out there. So when these movies only make women want another partner or break up with you, why would you as a men sit through these movies? In the movie Harry's marriage literally ends because his wife thinks it is not romantic enough, while what she actually wants is variation. Sally breaks up with her partner because she realises that she wants a traditional family rather than a life as a modern, childless couple.\n\n\n\n**Monkey thinks, but monkey also feels.** \"When Harry Met Sally\" has these scenes with the old people and it is a direct comparison of how things should be: 'People meet and stay together' versus how things are in the movie: 'Chaos'. Classical gender tropes are actually reversed since Sally is rational while Harry is emotional. \n\nWhat happens then is that Harry and Sally actually manage to become friends and do what they said is impossible. *Woman and Man are friends.* The old people are cheering because \"purity and tradition\" are upkept. However then feelings get in the way and we get this romantic ending, that originally was not in the script. Women are cheering because they think this is the proof these old people who say: \"Yeah we met and then we just got together forever.\" are wrong.\n\n\n\nSo why do I like the movie? Movies I like have to be unique in some way. What I love about this movie, is how it was supposed to be something completely different from what it is and most women who watch it misunderstand it. The movie was supposed to show the consequence of being indecisive. The director changed the ending because he got laid and he wanted to make his by now 35 year wife happy. *Ironic*", "label": 1}
