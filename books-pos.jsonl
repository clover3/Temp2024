You seem to think for some people that i support random Palestinians dying? I don't. No israeli does. We're people too.\nAnd again like i said - i academically studied this subject. I know my facts. I know the history better than most people I've met, and surely better than you. \nI'll answer my own question for you\n\nIn 1947 the partition plan was decided upon by the UN - the plan dictated that a portion of the land of israel would belong to the arab people (who didn't even call themselves Palestinians at the time, that only started in the 60s), and the other portion to the jewish people.\nJerusalem would belong to everyone. \nThe jewish people accepted that, very happily. They weren't interested in tons of land, just a safe place after what happened in the holocaust (6M jews died, a real genocide, i hope you knew this fact cause this is basic knowledge). So the accepted- not that they had a right not to, it was the UN's decision. \nThe arab people didn't accept. \nThe partition plan was a go on nov 29th 1947. \nThe arabs attacked the very next day, nov 30th 1947.\nThere was no IDF to defend anyone at the time, the attackers attacked defenseless people. Including my grandfather, by the way \n**They** opened the war that we call the independence war and they call the nakba. They attacked. They attacked with five other countries in fact - jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, syria, and iraq.\nAnd they lost. They opened war and lost. And that is what they call \"stealing\". \nThis is all facts, feel free to check me. \n\nSo again, i know the facts. I know my country. \nI *want* Palestinians to have their own country, but not at the expense of my country and my people. They could've had that in gaza, their leaders are filthy rich. \n\nAnd trollboy? I'm a girl, as my avatar clearly shows? \nHave a nice day", "label": 1}

I think Jeremy married Verity because she may have been a little better off than him, and obviously, she was insanely attractive. He was hooked due to her looks and confidence. He likely didn\u2019t want a casual relationship, as that wouldn\u2019t benefit him financially. Plus, a woman would eventually want kids (speaking only from a biological perspective\u2014guys, let me not be pointed for this). So, he got her pregnant, and they married.\n\nI believe she may have initially written the autobiography, but it definitely wasn\u2019t finished by her. I\u2019m not sure who killed Charlie or Harper, but it may have been Jeremy himself. When she confronted him, he could have created her accident. However, he doesn't know the truth about Verity being slightly recovered.\n\nNow, since she doesn\u2019t write any more books, he goes to Lowen because he needs Verity\u2019s money to live his life. Lowen, too, becomes obsessed with him because he has manipulated her\u2014she competes with Verity, and many times we see her wonder why she has become this way. She is made to believe he is the true victim in every way possible, to the point of assisting him with his wife\u2019s killing so she cannot really escape him. Now, he has the woman (and he can easily have her if he gets her pregnant) and the money.\n\nAnd maybe this is what it\u2019s all about.

Now all I have to do is find its audience...\n\nAn artificially intelligent human body hosting multiple human minds threatens the stability of a global state regulated by a massive social network.\n\nThe novel extrapolates social networks' pervasive nature and power into a future society whereby life in 'meatspace' is rationed following a long period of overcrowding that has endangered the survival of humanity. Separating the mind from the body and introducing artificial intelligence as an essential component to human existence form a culture that we still recognise but that adheres to fundamentally different rules of behaviour. Engineered adult bodies, the extension of life, and the eradication of family, old age and youth lead to extreme extensions of what we witness around us today. Rooted in manufactured bodies, the struggles of the growing AI population highlight what humanity is steadily losing by becoming more human than their creators have been for a long time.\n\nThere is no need for sleep as the minds go offline in shifts. Bods are maintained by training AIs physically resident in each bod, which minimises downtime. They are capable of free thought but are subject to the control of the vats as they represent the workforce responsible for production. Reproduction is via complex algorithms, and birth into meatspace occurs in adulthood. The care of child minds, their education, and upbringing occur in virtual space.\n\nNina Toft is the adopted personality of NT62, a bod bred in a vat in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. She narrowly misses destruction by the state after Ralf Theissen, the Berlin-based software developer responsible for her development, discovers her emergent behaviour. Nina has access to an unregistered vacant space to pursue her goals. She narrowly escapes destruction early on, thanks to Ralf, who decides to hide her and observe her further. She collaborates with other NT bods on a plan to remain safe.\n\nAgents of the state mistake the plan of a group of activist minds, who desire a single body each, for the growing number of NT bods connecting within the social network. On the run from the agents, Ralf becomes involved with the London-based historian Ava Metcalfe, who mistakenly betrayed the activists to the agents. Together, they physically hack into the social network.\n\n[https://books2read.com/vacant-space](https://books2read.com/vacant-space)", "label": 1}

{"text": "Fame and popularity have indeed affected several authors significantly, often in ways that mirror George R.R. Martin\u2019s experience but with different impacts on their work, mental health, or public interactions. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n# 1. J.D. Salinger\n\nAfter publishing *The Catcher in the Rye*, J.D. Salinger quickly became an icon but was overwhelmed by his fame. He found the public\u2019s fascination intrusive, which drove him to retreat from public life entirely. Salinger\u2019s fame influenced his personal life to the extent that he stopped publishing new work altogether, maintaining a strict privacy until his death.\n\n# 2. Harper Lee\n\nThe success of *To Kill a Mockingbird* brought intense attention to Harper Lee, who reportedly felt enormous pressure to write a second novel that would live up to her debut. The demand for more work and constant public scrutiny pushed her away from publishing, and she remained largely out of the public eye until *Go Set a Watchman* was controversially published decades later.\n\n# 3. J.K. Rowling\n\nWhile J.K. Rowling achieved massive success with the *Harry Potter* series, her fame has led to a mixed experience. The spotlight shifted from her writing to her public image, and her interactions on social media have sometimes sparked significant backlash. This has affected her personally and shaped the reception of her newer works under her pseudonym, Robert Galbraith.\n\n# 4. F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nKnown for *The Great Gatsby*, Fitzgerald achieved a level of celebrity that impacted his mental health and work. The pressures of fame, coupled with financial instability and alcoholism, contributed to a decline in his later writing. His desire to maintain his status in the literary world affected him deeply, both personally and professionally.\n\n# 5. Stephen King\n\nKing embraced his fame but admitted it had its toll, particularly with substance abuse in the early years of his career. King\u2019s productivity didn\u2019t wane like Martin\u2019s, but he has spoken openly about struggling to meet the public's high expectations, even as he managed to continue publishing consistently.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin\u2019s fame and the pressures tied to it might be unique in that it has become a meme-like cultural phenomenon tied to expectations for a single series. Yet, Martin is not alone in feeling the weight of public demand and scrutiny. The experience of fame can be challenging for many authors, and while some retreat, others respond by setting strict boundaries or exploring other genres and pseudonyms. Each response illustrates how deeply fame can impact an author\u2019s creative process and personal life.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I thought this book was one of Johnson's 3 masterpieces, up there with Jesus' Son and Angels.\n\nI LOVE the part where Grainer \"would sometimes sing to himself. Then he remembered that he was a sad man and stopped.\"\n\nIt broke my heart. The way those evil Canadians (and I am Canadian) told the Native guy that if you drink beer with lemonade you won't get drunk because the citrus kills the alcohol's effects? The Native who'd never been drunk before in his life? Who then comes to a very bad end because of he believed those Canadians? (There's a line in the story about it being the 20s, and Prohibition was in effect, so Canadians were considered \"experts\" when it came to booze.)\n\nGreat story. The ending was a little perplexing to me, but I still think about it.\n\nIt was a fantastic portrayal of a lonely man living a lonely life. Johnson is usually at his best when he's writing about men forced into intimate proximity when they don't want to be (military life, drunks drinking at a bar, inmates in prison) but this one was just a solitary guy who lived well into the 20th century but never really joined it. There's a line somewhere near the end that mentions he'd never ever used a telephone is his life. Which isn't THAT shocking. I can think of two pertinent quotes here:\n\n**\"The future is here. It's just not widely dispersed.\"** \\- Some tech bro deep into life extension techniques and whose house is set up like it's from the year 2089.  \n  \nSo Grainier was still living like it was the 1890s well into the 20th century because it was all he knew. Then there's this quote about the past:\n\n**\"From the beginning, we find evidence of a deep continuity that is the legacy of an unimaginably distant past. The nation itself represents the nexus of custom with custom, the shifting patterns of habitual activity. This may not be a particularly exciting philosophy of history but it is important to avoid the myth of some fated or providential movement forward. Below the surface of events lies a deep, and almost geological, calm. . . . We still live deep in the past.\u201d** \\- Peter Ackroyd\n\nTrain Dreams is a book I will always treasure. There's nothing like it in Johnson's corpus and nothing like it, that I've read, in American lit. Sometimes a Great Notion has a lot of logging but there's a lot of social interaction going on. The most social interaction Grainier gets is with the she-wolf and by howling at the other wolves at night.\n\nNot sure the book is about madness. I think Grainier has been on his own for so long that she thinks the she-wolf is his daughter when really she isn't. Isolation can warp things. Ideas pop into your head and you start believing them. Byt your reading is def fascinating, I'm not taking anything away from that.", "label": 1}

We were forced to read it in high school, aloud, in class; each student taking turns reading a passage. The teacher had to pause frequently to explain what every single phrase meant, because none of it was coherent to our contemporary ears. Suffice to say, I retained absolutely *nothing* of the story that way.\n\nThe story that made me physically angry was SevenEves, because the author is so full of himself that he thought it was a good idea to waste every other page with the most useless, pointless expositions about physics.

I have an old Wired magazine that says how we'll evolve into super-powered multitasking brainiacs over tab-bing and app-ing. We gave our kids devices because they'll invent their own media, language, rules. (It's clear now that it didn't happen. So now what?)\n\n\nThen, there's the negative view.
