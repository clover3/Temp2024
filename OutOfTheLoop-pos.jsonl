We\u2019ve seen a decline in his percentage recently, with it topping out at around 66 a week to two weeks ago.\n\nThis is due to a sell-off, where people are satisfied with their winnings having gone up in value, and don\u2019t want to risk the possibility of their bets being called against a Trump loss.\n\nFor example: if you bought in September 24\u2019 for $.25, and sale price is around $.75 the day before election, you can mark a 200% increase by selling off your position. This could be a very large pay-out depending on how much was bet.\n\nTl;dr, these numbers don\u2019t mean much in the grand scheme of things, but they do identify a high-confidence among those placing the bets that Trump will be the president.", "label": 1}
