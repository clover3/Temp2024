His endorsement of their artists specifically is another clear indicator that he is involved.\n\nIt benefits Eldridge like so:\n\nDrake has a large fanbase, it\u2019s just inflated and propped up by the media. Eldridge owns all of the music media publications and the company that collects all of the numbers, they keep the world updated on his lifestyle and curate his image.\nThey then use Drake for his \u201cstimulus pack\u201d on their own roster of artists.\n\nUMG owns Drake\u2019s catalogue, so advertising him through Eldridge means benefits UMG too.\n\nA company like Gamma takes a lot of foresight. Larry Jackson probably saw the growth of AM and figured he could do the same for gamma, but we\u2019re in a different era.\n\nDrake is in serious debt with UMG and until he recoups $400m from sales he won\u2019t own his own masters. He has an expensive lifestyle and a lot of business ventures, but the one thing that will truly make him money is his masters. Wayne sold Drake\u2019s pre-2018 masters in 2020 to UMG.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I think it started adding more pop/dance tracks around 2010-2011 (while still keeping hip hop/r&b on its playlist while having a more balanced approach) then started decreasing the dance-pop tracks by 2014-2015 while still retaining the rhythmic pop titles and becoming more heavy on Hip hop/R&B titles. I think in mid-2016 they started going officially back toward a hip hop based format significally dropping most the remaining dance pop titles though it would increase rhythmic pop with some dance titles again by 2017. Seems like they already went toward what they used to be in 2018 but they also apparently added reggaeton to its mix while being heavy on hip hop and having some dance/rhythmic crossover content in their playlist.", "label": 0}

They can overcharge and effectively get people to just accept a plea deal rather than risk losing an extra 10 years.  It's not as prevalent at the state level because they don't have as much discretion to add accelerators.\n\nThe Kevin Ring case is pretty famous for it.  Feds offered him a plea deal of no jail time and a huge fine.  He must have thought he was innocent because he went to trial and was found guilty on 5 of 8 accounts.  The guidelines for his penalties would be 17 to 22 years and the prosecutors asked for 20 years.  The other people in his corruption case were pleading for less than 4 years, despite being more involved.  The judge ultimately rejected the 20 years, but just shows how the feds try to punish you exercising your 6th amendment right.", "label": 0}
