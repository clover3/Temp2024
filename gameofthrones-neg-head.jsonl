I couldn't find a look-alike of Rhaenys, so she has to stay with you and possibly die.\"\n\nElia would probably say, \"Varys you imbecile, enough with your plotting. Lead me through the secret passage. There'll be enough time for plotting after I get my children safely to Dorne.\"\n\nOnce people says to Varys, Princess Elia was said to love both her children, So why would she not save Rhaenys? Was she a fool in love with the idea of her Son sitting on the Iron Throne in the distant future that she would sacrifice herself and her young daughter? Yeah Right! FAegon is more like a whoreson, rather than Rhaegar's Son.\n\nAlso look at Varys character.\nVarys said to be the one who revealed Rhaegar's Harrenhall plot to Areys.\nSo, what is his motivation to Save Aegon?

They could have had theme parks, fairs, experiences like their own Medieval Nights, licensed hotels, watered down the material to begin reaching to children with age appropriate toys and media, and they just allowed it to implode because they had hubris.

{"text": "Lol I appreciate the clarification, but I wouldn't have seen your question as an attack.\n\nThe reason I think that has more to do with his actions and not necessarily the way he was presented in the show. This includes sending Bran and Jojen their visions in an attempt to manipulate them into coming North, knowingly sacrificing Jojen to do so. At the time, it's presented as mystical importance, but by the end, it turns out it's just the 3ER's will.  \nOther notable evil actions are things like giving Theon his final speech to manipulate him into sacrificing himself to stall for enough time for Arya to make her move and quite literally taking over Bran's body to keep his life going.\n\nHowever, the biggest giveaway that he's evil is the way he manipulates Sam. Sam is literally the only person alive who knows about Rhaegar's annulment, and he's the only person who the 3ER decides to tell about Jon's true parentage. By looking into the past, he knows that Sam will stand up for Jon as a leader, even if he doesn't want it himself (like when he was elected Lord Comander), and he needed something to catalyze a rift between Jon and Dany's claim to the Throne. That rift is what ended up causing the rest of the plot to go down the way it did, including Dany going crazy and Jon being the one to kill her. Without his intervention, either Dany becomes Queen or Jon becomes King. The only way to make that not happen is for madness to overtake Dany and for Jon to be the one to put an end to it. He knows from Bran's mind that Ned taught them the old ways of the one passing the sentence should be the one to wield the blade, and he knows Jon loves Dany too much to let anyone else be the one. Beyond that, the only thing that made Jon ineligible from claiming the Throne was the fact that he killed Dany while she still had a standing army in King's Landing. Jon being ineligible is what directly led the council to elect him as King. He even gloats about it to Jon's face afterward telling him \"You were exactly where you were supposed to be.\" \n\nThose actions are concrete, but I also think there were other more disputable actions at play as well like using crows cawing to cause Bran to get caught and pushed from the tower; and that he sent the Azor Ahai vision to Aegon I to ensure Jon's birth, but there's not really evidence for these so they're more just personal belief.", "label": 0}

In Westeros some believe he was The Last Hero.\n\nAzor Ahai is a religious figure from the cult of R'hllor.  \nAnd here you are not referring to a prophecy but to a legend.   \nAn Asshaii legend about a hero with a red who fought the darkness during the first Long Night.

They make millions and millions of dollars every time a new Ice & Fire book comes out, as do I. Delaying makes no sense. Why would HBO want the books delayed? The books help create interest in the show, just as the show creates interest in the books.\n\n>So\u2026 no, the books are not done. HBO did not ask me to delay them. Nor did David & Dan.

The book is way more descriptive (sometimes in a good way, sometimes takes too long in it) and always shares the characters inner thoughts (always positive) while the show has a much bigger scope in the scenes, it doesn\u2019t just follow one characters POV.\n\nThat would be the main difference IMO, each chapter follows a specific character\u2019s mind and even the writing styles differ, Sansa initially is in a fairytale, Ned in the mind of a troubled and responsible man, Jon in a bitter, lost yet ambitious young man and Tyrion in a smart ass, cunning and analytical view. There are pros and cons to this, and given that the show is pretty much 1-1 with a couple things cut (like the 10 page description of climbing the Eerie [that\u2019s what I meant with takes too long]) and a lot of scenes added (mostly from characters with no POV, like Robert and Jaime) I would say they are both equivalent.", "label": 0}

Though she's hailed as a people's queen and has done great things in slaver's bay, Dany is usually *above* her people. Jon in that scene is *with* his people, fighting and almost dying with them, and that's why they admire him. Dany is a 'saviour' of the downtrodden,  but Jon actually brings them together. He stands up for people like Sam and for the wildlings, not as their ruler but as one of them - he is a steward, and then lives amongst the wildlings. Dany never *lowers* herself enough for me to think her character is about unity.\n\nIn the scene where she meets Jon, she is introduced with her long list of titles on the throne above him, while Jon is 'this is Jon Snow. He's the King in the North'. She is bringing fire and blood to conquer Westeros, and is seen by the Westerosi lords as an invader with heathen armies. Jon is the one who brings the threat of the Night King to everyone and insists they band together and put aside their power struggles. In all regards, he is managing to do the uniting. \n\nAnd in season 8, Jon fulfils the prophecy of Azor Ahai by killing his beloved (Dany) and saving the world (from her). But I may be wrong about that because I don't know much about the books. Regardless, whether or not it was a *good* ending, I believe the ending does make out Jon to be the ptwp.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I think it\u2019s important to establish the political situation first the reach is pretty much already in the hands of renly along with the stormlands they are gone, the eryie is run by lysa it\u2019s gone, the north and the riverlands are on robs side and dorne hates the Lannisters. \n\n\nThere\u2019s no alliance forming with the reach cause they are team renly at this point and want their daughter to be a queen\n\n\nFirst things first hiring a legion of sellswords and telling them to land in the north and have fun. The riverlands forces were bogged down and couldn\u2019t really help Robb cause of the raiding by the mountain and westerlands. So do the same in the north. At the very least it applies pressure to the north leadership and in war even the tiniest bit of pressure on ur enemies help. At best it forces the northern forces to fall back to the north and deal with the problem. Allowing the riverlands to be picked off and mopped up by Tywin and locking the north in their own lands at the neck. \n\n\nTell Varys to send spies into the reach and storm land to keep ties on renly and possible drop the knowledge that renly and Loras are lovers(a open secret it is, but open secrets turn lethal when they are no longer secrets) and to keep tabs on any issues in that alliance or weak points to exploit \n\n\nNext setup a plan to muster crow lands forces and immediately attack Stannis cause at that point before renly death he only had roughly around a few thousand (it\u2019s estimated about 5 thousand of dragon stone vassals) the crownlands can musters a good size army (at least 10-22,000 soldiers) a immediate attack on Stannis who is the second most battle hardened commander in the entire war  keeping him at least bogged down is the best move cause 5,000 isn\u2019t a lot but in the right hands can be dangerous as 10,000 \n\n\nNext up try and  round up the stark girls to leverage as peace arrangements while also attempting to broker a deal with the iron islands to slice up the north for them if they support the crown and offer to marry Theon into the royal family. The north is big asf and with them being in open rebellion few ppl would see a issue with them  loosing land this would be after a few months of the north being ravaged by sellswords and the ironborn and the riverlands are put back in place and the Tully\u2019s taken hostage.  Forcing the starks to sign a peace deal that\u2019s on my side and keep a stark as hostage and a Tully as well. And for them  them to attack their eyrie to prove their loyalty \n\n\nAfter that we are left with renly for this it tricky.  I would offer to break my betrothal to  Sansa on grounds that her father is traitor and her family started a war. And marry Margery, this very tricky cause the reach is a coin flip. they joined renly cause of the relationship with Loras, but the minute renly was dead the allied with the Lannisters and married Margery off again. The tricky part is that  depended on Stannis being the one who assassinated  renly. With all that being said I\u2019m gonna have assassination attempt on renly and try to marry Margery should it succeed.  If they say no after renly death we are still at war with them. So nothing to lose a lot to gain \n\nHowever should the assassins succeed and with Stannis stuck on dragon stone the stormlands are mine or tommans by right so i  would try to get the storm lands to swear fealty to me or tomman (i mean that\u2019s really their only options) then after that giving me three armies of at least 10,000 men \nRough guess (according to google) would give the crown 108,000 men (22,000-crownlands, 40,000-the stormlands, 56,000- the westerlands)", "label": 0}

In real life that's before farming was invented on Earth. In practice any memory of the White Walkers would have disappeared in a few hundred years. After that the Watch is basically a border defense legion. Throughout history, it was incredibly hard to keep such militarized border armies within control. Roman frontier legions were notorious for proclaiming Emperors or rebelling otherwise. This is despite these armies being paid very well in coin, land and honors after retirement. The NW members get no pay or retirement, no lands and titles and give up all claims to their actual or hypothetical titles and claims. Roman armies were volunteers not criminals sent from the black cells. In conclusion, compared to real frontier armies the NW has no motivation to stay at it's position other than honor and much more incentive to go AWOL and much more opportunity as well given the self governing Status of the Watch and access to ships and a port.\nTo make it all worse, the Watch has been failing at it's main job for the last few hundred years which is to keep out Wilding raiders. Raiders who have managed to turn vast swathes of the Gift land desolate. It's a total miracle the Watch has not collapsed centuries ago.\nIt would be funny to see a story in which Jon desperately flees from the Wildings to warn the Watch of Mance Raydar's invading army to find that after Ned Stark got beheaded and Rob Stark got betrayed at the Red Wedding the vast majority of the Watch saw an opportunity to flee the North and took it and only Sam, Edd, Allison Thorne and Maester Aemon are left", "label": 0}

Send them transcripts and eye witness accounts of Ned\u2019s public confession. Establish that the beheading was both legal and just. Inform the northern lords  that there\u2019s an opportunity for a power restructuring in the North if the Stark family doesn\u2019t accept terms. I don\u2019t need to turn them against the Starks. I just need to weaken their resolve. \n3. Use spies, Maesters, Septuns, and household staff to spread rumors that Ned may have been poisoned or ill from infection. If he wasn\u2019t intentionally treasonous then he was at least unintentionally treasonous. If none of the Starks household remain alive to bribe or threaten then I\u2019ll hire someone to pretend to be them. The goal is to cast doubt. \u201cLord Eddard was an honorable man but he was out of his wits with fever. What was the young king to do?\u201d \n4. Reach out for alliances and trading partnerships to near by foreign countries. The North and everyone else needs to see that the Reign of Joffrey Baratheon will be a profitable and stable one. \n5. Send out Tyrion with a band of small performers and musicians to reenact the story of Ned going mad with fever and attacking his best friend\u2019s son and heir. Give out bread, pickled eggs, dried fruits and ales at the events. \n6. Offer Walder Frey a seat on the small council with a fancy title if he keeps the northern forces on their side of the bridge and assists in negotiations which will happen under his roof. He can give the seat to someone else from his household if he wishes. \n7. Send a ship to the Nights Watch with an emissary. I\u2019ll agree to change the conditions of the oath so that after 5 years of honorable service they can marry, and after 15 years of honorable service they can retire with a full royal pardon and pension based on their rank at retirement. In retirement they will still forever be Nights Watch, they can be called back into service in emergencies, but they will not be active members and don\u2019t have to stay at the wall. I\u2019ll also agree to increase food fashions, pelts and furs, and send engineers to assist with improving conditions. There will also be a villa reserved in the south for elderly and disabled Crows. They served at the Wall as brothers in the cold. They can end their days as brothers in warmth and comfort. The caveat is that they now answer to the crown and assist in internal defense as well as guarding the wall. Meaning the Starks now have multiple flanks to guard. \n8. Ballon Greyjoy wants to pay the iron price. I want to cut off the Starks. Hire Iron born captains as privateers. There will be a bounty on any ships loyal to the Starks. If they capture a ship from a Stark port they keep the ship and its cargo and they get a bonus from the crown. Same with sacking Stark loyalist port cities. They can pay the iron price, then they get a little gold on top. This will wreaking the ability of the Starks to get support and it will keep fighting men occupied defending ports and ships. \n9. Sue for peace immediately, publicly and every 7 days thereafter. Read the proclamations of peace in court flanked by Septuns and maesters. Ensure the heads of all major families, or suitable representative/hostage, are in attendance for each reading. Make it clear war is not my goal. But the kingdoms stand united. \n10. Buy some land in Qarth. It looks really nice there. Preferably next to the Spice King. Learn how to pronounce his full name. Figure out some ways to get merchandise flowing. Figure out some ways to get more money into his pockets. Stimulate the economy. Get things booming. Make hay while the sun shines. After all winter is coming.", "label": 0}
