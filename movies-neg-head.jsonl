{"text": "If they have no problem with it, why shouldn't it be their job? An actor is there to carry out a vision for a character, story etc.\n\nLet's put it this way. When AI is accessible enough that people can make their own full length feature films without using a single actor, should they not have characters that appear fully nude? \n\nIf not, then I don't think your problem is just about the actor's job requirements being problematic, but rather with the nudity itself. If you think they should if they want to have a character appear that way, then willing actors should be taking those roles. Yeah it's problematic that some might feel unduly influenced to compete with other actors for roles that have those requirements, but this is true in basically every aspect of our society and all other jobs, just generally it's not around sex or nudity but based around something else. \n\nThere's a lot of things that I've done or that I know others have done that I would NEVER willingly do on my own, but I have done it on the behalf of employers because if I don't then someone else will and I'll be out of a job. I'm not even saying anything terribly heinous, certainly not even illegal, but something that is below my standards. I have high standards for myself, and I hate compromising for businesses to do bullshit that I'd never do if I didn't feel like I had to compete with less scrupulous people that would do it if I didn't.\n\nI'm for taking a stand against that dynamic in general, though I don't think it's realistic to actually do anything about it, but it makes no sense to specifically pick out people in acting jobs and call out that one unfair dynamic when many other jobs have something just like it.", "label": 0}

Having a lot of explicit sex and nude scenes sets a certain standard for actors and could lead to actors, who don't want to do this, not getting good roles. And many actors have said that they had bad experiences with some of those scenes. Emilia Clarke for example isn't against nude and sex scenes, but has stated that she had to fight to not be shown nude in the scenes where she felt it didn't fit. She also said that her nude scenes felt really terrifying.

{"text": "We were a bunch of kids recently out of film school when we shot this film.  We could write, we could shoot, we could edit.  So production was pretty easy for us.  But after that, getting into post is when we ran into problems.\n\n\\- Cutting what we shot into the coherent narrative of the film was time-consuming but doable.  But we probably spent 2 years editing, dealing with the holes in the script, and all the mistakes we made during production.  That wasn't bad though, just 2 years, Primer took 2 years to edit.\n\n\\- Visual Effects was a huge issue.  Our 2D VFX actually went really well, we got two amazing artists through our DP who delivered great work relatively quickly.  But the 3D VFX was a nightmare.  We didn't have funds to pay people professional rates, but we wanted it to look good.  We kept getting VFX artists on board who were pros, who could deliver the results, but they were working for so little they were basically volunteering, doing bits in their spare time, so it went sloooow.  And then eventually Peter Jackson would call and they'd be off to work on some blockbuster and we'd be back to square one.  Eventually we got Joel LeLievre onboard, for a lot more money than we'd paid anyone beforehand, but still for way less than pro rates, and he delivered.  All the 3D work in the film is his and I'm so proud of it.  That was probably 6-7 years on VFX though...\n\n\\- Funding. I knew we needed funding to finish the film.  Eventually that was my goal.  I probably spent a year and a half writing grant applications, applying for funding.  We always got rejected.  Frequently they'd reject us before they even read our proposals, without watching what we had, cause we weren't professional artists or filmmakers or whatever.  In order to get money to make movies, you have to have made movies, so how do you start?  I thought they'd look at our stuff and read our proposals and realize there was something there, but they never did.\n\n\\- Sound.  The last piece was sound.  We had a sound team working with us at the beginning, after production.  They did amazing work, recorded our voice overs, did ADR, but they couldn't finish cause the rest of the film wasn't done, everything else was still in the air.  So they waited around, but not forever, eventually we lost them.  Same thing with our composer, we had an amazing composer, but he couldn't wait for years while the rest of the pieces came together.  When we eventually did finish the movie, I hired a professional sound team and paid them professional rates, and that's how we finished it.  Our sound team is amazing, I'm so proud of the work of our composer and our audio post team.  But they did it from scratch, when the rest of the movie was done, and we paid them.", "label": 0}

No one side is seen in black and white, good versus evil.\n\nThe fact that they chose to have California and Texas united keeps you guessing - because that seems almost impossible in the current state of American Politics.\n\nThe performances are great, Jesse Plemmons is amazing in his short time on screen and is TERRIFYING, and the sound track is incredible.\n\nWhatever I thought it was going to be I was mistaken and really enjoyed it.", "label": 0}

He\u2019s basically the villain version of a Mary Sue in the film. \n\nBut that\u2019s not what makes the movie a chore. That would be characters making trite speeches every other scene. Bruce, Gordon, and Alfred all take turns making speech after speech hammering in the themes of the movie which, let\u2019s face it, aren\u2019t that deep. All capped off with the stupid \u201cmore than a hero\u201d speech that could have been pulled off /r/imfourteenandthisisdeep.", "label": 0}

The acting is great, specially Di Caprio as Archer and Hounsou as Solomon Vandy, production values are great, the themes and setting is very interesting, the action is exciting and so on. \n\nMy absolute biggest problem with this movie is how after the first act it just completely sidelines Solomon in favor of that ridiculous love story between between Archer and Maddy (Jennifer Connelly). It is his story that is central to the movie, only he knows where the diamond is buried, which is the only reason Archer is helping him in the first place. They are essentially using each other. But after the first act he is reduced to being a passive character, just being dragged from place to place by Archer and Maddy, like a child or a dog. The whole movie takes place in his country, among his people but he basically becomes part of the scenery while the two white characters bond over being white in Africa I guess. \n\nIt really is Edward Zwick at his absolute worst.", "label": 0}

There have been so many bad movies/shows that have followed that mold that just seeing that a new production has them has become an indicator that the product isn't going to be very good. Overall that's going to hurt the goals of inclusivity that the folks making them are trying to achieve. Eventually that's going to impact the bottom line hard enough that the bounce back effect is going to get rough.\n\nI almost didn't watch Agatha All Along because it seemed akin to products that had previously wasted my time, and if I hadn't heard good things from people I trust I'd have missed out as I've really enjoyed it.

It's an awfully big place with lots of planets, characters, and lore. And, with the Skywalker saga previously resolved within the context of the original films, and the principal cast largely aged out of their roles, it was a great opportunity to start over.\n\nFocusing on Luke, Han, and Leia's post-retirement shenanigans against the remnants of the previously defeated Empire was certainly a choice. And, while I didn't hate it as much as some people did, I will admit those films provided no further conclusion to an already resolved storyline.\n\nThat they're considering making even more of these films to provide even more resolution to the story is just downright bewildering.

But up to that point he doesn't really show any menace or rage, just annoyance and self-interest. Then at that point he goes on his killing Sentinel diatribe which is a little much, but still understandable. From that point on it's an outright *sprint* to becoming the mean, nasty Megatron. \n\nA single flash of meanness or a sharp rebuke or Orion's antics before going along with him, would have been enough to plant the seed. \n\nIt doesn't need to be spelled out, but for power to reveal what's already there, we have to see that something is already there.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Here, its Friday and I was bored and just to show you what a meant in my other comment I wrote an outline for a rewrite of The Last Jedi that actually makes sense:\n\n- They have to evacuate the base because the FO are coming.\n- Rebels scramble together and bring what they can, but it isn't much and they all know it\n- They start arguing about what they should do, but Leia says they don't have time to figure out a full plan now and she picks a place to go regroup\n- They jump away thinking they are safe for the moment since they got out before the FO arrives\n\n- Note: Rey scenes of training / finding out how disillusioned Luke is are scattered throughout wherever would make sense in the edit\n\n- Rebels arrive in new system, character motivations and concerns are established as they argue about a plan\n- FO order shows up out of nowhere. Rebels desparately try to hold them back \n- Poe has an idea for a reckless gamble to *try and distract* the FO fleet to let the majority rebels escape. It's selfless but wasteful of their limited resources\n- He's ordered not to do that but does it anyway\n- The distraction fails as it is almost wiped out and the survivors barely make it back to the fleet in time to jump away\n- Bridge is wiped out as they are about to leave and only Leia lives by using the force to close a pressure door control that she can't reach but she's seriously injured\n\n- Rebels arrive at a smaller friendly base to rearm what they can and assess what resources remain\n- Their dire situation is shown because the base doesn't really have anything that can help them against an entire fleet, but they rearm as best they can and the fleet tries to figure out what next\n- Character development happens as the new commanders have to deal with Poe's insubordination that cost them valuable ships and crew, as well as having to deal with all the previous leadership being dead\n- As the finger pointing reaches boiling point, the FO show up again ready to fight\n- Confused as to how they were found, the new commanders tell the fleet to jump to a random system, then jump to a different system that has another friendly base just in case\n- They jump away without trying to fight\n\n- Rebels arrive at the new \"friendly\" base, but the people there tell them they won't help because the FO nuked the entire planet where the last base they stopped at was located\n- Rebels are getting desparate and start to think that they have a spy among them who is telling the FO where they are\n- A small group is ordered to go find out if there is a spy by following up on a lead that someone on Canto Bight might have info\n- Fleet is going to keep moving and jumping around to try and stay ahead, but makes plans with the people on the Canto plot to meet up in a system\n\n- Canto plot happens but instead of already knowing about a tracking device, they are there to investigate a potential spy and in the process this is when they find out that there is a tracking devidce on the fleet (no trying to get codes from a hacker BS, the hacker could have been involved in the development of the system)\n\n- While they are busy investigating the spy / tracking, the fleet goes from feeling safe to under attack multiple times, each getting more desparate (yes, kinda like battlestar galactica)\n- They are about completely worn thin when a signal comes in from the team investigating that they are ready to rendezvous\n\n- The investigation team and the fleet meet up\n- Rey meets back up and tells them that Luke wasn't able to help and that there's no last jedi coming to save them\n- The commanders are told that the FO order has the ability to track the ships and that they'll keep following\n- Rebels are absolutely desperate now as they know they are being corned\n- They make a plan to jump to Crait where there is a defensive base and try to set a trap to hit the FO fleet when it jumps in as a way to hopefully distract the fleet from seeing the transports evacuating people to the base on the planet\n\n- The FO jumps into Crait system, but they show up much closer than the rebels expected - basically inside what is left of the rebel fleet\n- They see the transports and know that they are going to have to attack the base on the planet\n- Holdo decides to buy time by driving her flagship at their flagship and self destructing right next to it in some way that will destroy the flagship (this gets rid of the problem created in the movie as far as if a ship jumping to hyperspace can be used as a battering ram, why aren't there concrete blocks with hyperdrives on them to be used as missles and such)\n- FO flagship is destroyed but the section where Snoke and Kylo are is shown to be able to separate off and act like a ship of its own. It follows the rebels and lands near the base (its presence on the planet means that the rest of the FO fleet can't just glass the surface from space)\n\n- Final scenes are a desparate fight on the planet as the rebels try to defend the base against a seige inside the base while Rey and whoever else try to get into the command section of the ship to kill Snoke / Kylo before the base is taken\n- Throne room fight Snoke killed\n- Kylo decides to finish the job and kill the rebels etc\n- Luke shows up or whatever\n- Things end kind of how it did but with the handful of rebel **leadership** (not the entire rebellion like in the movie - that doesn't make a lick of sense) getting away", "label": 0}
