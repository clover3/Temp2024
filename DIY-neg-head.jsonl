So a 4' wide strip (3 joist spaces) in a say 12' wide room doesn't cover much of the floor. Also you are only adding enough insulation to fill the small air space left over from the existing insulation, so achieving a new R34 instead of the old R30 in only 3 joist spaces is negligible.\n\nYour uncomfort can be caused by a lot of/combination of things. No air sealing on garage ceiling, not enough attic insulation, poor HVAC (no return, far from furnace, undersized duct, improper balancing), leaky windows, wall insulation/air barrier, etc. \n\nThe better way to get the floor plane addressed is to pull down the garage ceiling. Drywall is cheap. Then you have a few choices, but it involves creating an air barrier in addition to as much R value of insulation you can get. Spray foam, batt insulation, and rigid board are involved in those choices.", "label": 0}

It gets up to about 50-55 degrees, and is designed just to take the chill out of a room and make it much easier for any room heater to pull the temperature up from 50 to 72 degrees or so. Apply the conductive flat copper foil to the wall, one conductor on one side and the other at the other end of the wall 8-10 feet away. The two conductors go to a little transformer/power supply/wall wart that doesn't suck much power at all.    Paint the wall with this paint (it is generally carbon black), and when it dries you can paint over it any color you want. You now have a wall that is heated to 50-55 degrees F.

The baffles would need to extend down, into the soffit area, where you would need soffit vents, if you don't have them. \n\nSince your rafters are undersized, you would need to extend them down, to make them wide enough to accommodate though enough insulation. Them you would need cross strapping, to level the roof plane for sheetrock. Before installing sheetrock, install plastic vapor barrier to entire under side of roof, down exterior wall.

{"text": "Also absolutely supporting the permit.  This is a huge job for a DIYer.  I\u2019m a licensed general contractor and I would warn a client how extensive this job is.   \n\nThis is more than tearing out the staircase and running new stringers.  Extending the staircase means you will contact the low point of the ceiling earlier where the header supports the floor upstairs.  \n\nImagine a hole is cut in the upstairs floor allowing the staircase.  You can\u2019t just cut a hole though, you have to support the joists you cut.  The way this is done is by adding a header across the \u201ccut\u201d joists and fasten them to it.  Then the header is support on either side of it by the continuous joists.  If you extended the staircase, the existing header will be in the way.   Where is it?   In this case, it\u2019s very likely over the wall with the door to the attic (if the ceiling is wide open once inside the door.) \n\nThe way this project would legally be accomplished is a new header installed opening the \u201chole\u201d up larger.  This will make structural changes to the floor upstairs and the ceiling below.  \n\nAs others have noted, once you mess with something, you have to do it to current code, which means your new rise and run must fit within a specific size.  We can\u2019t really tell from the pics if you have enough space to do this, but I know when I ran a new staircase in a turn of the century house with a steep climb to the second story, there were several feet of distance required to make it legal.  (In that case, the ceiling was open in the entire foyer, so there was no header issue.)\n\nThis is a big job, and that\u2019s without seeing the structure for ourselves.", "label": 0}

I\u2019m sure that there will be a hundred different tool packages you can buy from major retailers for less than normal. Look for something with multiple batteries, those are the more expensive part if you aren\u2019t buying a package of tools. I suggest checking your options on a price charting website, so you can verify it\u2019s actually a good deal. \n\nI don\u2019t think the brand is the most relevant piece of information, especially when you start. Milwaukee has more specific tools for specifically the trades, while Dewalt has a whole suite of lawn care tools. I\u2019ve heard good things about Ryobi tools if you\u2019re on a budget. \n\nI personally have Dewalt cordless tools, and they are all brushless.

{"text": "The new brushless cordless tools with lithium batteries can do a lot of hard work, but corded still is important for the really tough jobs, especially if used for work rather than just home stuff.  \n\nI am invested in Ryobi's 18v line of tools. I have their rotary hammer drill and have loved it. I've drilled probably a few hundred holes in concrete with it as well as using it with a big scraper blade to chisel/scrap concrete floors. They also have a 40v line of tools that includes lawn mowers and other larger/higher power requirement tools, but I have not yet given up my gas tools to that. Batteries should dictate what you buy, you don't want to buy a bunch of different brands that all require their own battery and chargers. Pick a brand and stick with it. Lot of people talk crap on Ryobi, but they really have gotten much better in the last 10 years or so. I think many of their tools can hold up as well as Milwaukee or DeWalt for a somewhat smaller price tag. \n\nOn specific thing I would never use a cordless for is mixing grout/thinset/mortar.

{"text": "Sign shop owner here. \nFirst, this frosted vinyl is one of the most persnickety products we work with, so the idea that you struggled on the first try is not a giant surprise. \nRemove it and clean the glass all over again. \nSpray with glass cleaner and scrape the whole window repeatedly with a razor blade. Then spray with glass cleaner again and get it looking good. Then dab a paper towel with a half dollar size of rubbing alcohol and clean the whole thing again. The Polish with a dry paper towel.\nThe application fluid should be a spray bottle of water, about two tablespoons of rubbing alcohol and one drop (!!) of dish soap. That's is. We use this solution every day. \nYour plastic drywall knife is not the tool. It's not as smooth as you think.\nI would recommend getting an actual application squeegee with felt on one side from Amazon or similar.\n(1) Clean the glass as described. (2) Absolutely soak the glass and the vinyl with application fluid. (3) Use the felt side of the squeegee first. Work from the top down so gravity is working with you. You will \"chase\" the fluid down as you go. You can also go outside and check your progress. For the first ten minutes or so, the vinyl is very willing to allow you to chase bubbles to the edges. Work gently. Chasing a bubble slowly gives time for the vinyl that is already stuck to release and allow the bubble by. If you press a bubble too fast/hard it will just fold over and make a permanent wrinkle.\nWork with the felt side of the squeegee until it's all even. Then spray the outside of the vinyl with a light dusting of fluid, then switch to the hard side of the squeegee. Work from the center out to the edges. The fluid is here to prevent you from deeply scratching the surface of the vinyl.\nLike I said at the beginning, this product it a chore. Get the right solution and the right tools. Try to work with the product instead of fighting against it and it will go your way.\nhttps://a.co/d/eUFMviT", "label": 0}
