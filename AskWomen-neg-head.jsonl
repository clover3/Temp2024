His dad was an alcoholic and used meth and was physically abusive to him and his brother, he didn\u2019t want to be like his dad but he would lean into the drinking as a coping mechanism and blame it on his predisposition.

He\u2019d never not been in a relationship, the timeline between his first wife and me is very narrow, we met five months after they separated and they\u2019d only been officially divorced for a month when we started seeing each other. Even now he\u2019s in another relationship and we\u2019ve been separated for 5 months. He also would turn everything around on me and make me feel like I had to apologize or else we\u2019d never reach a resolution. Quite literally told me that he didn\u2019t feel like he needed to apologize to me anymore because I\u2019d hurt him in the past and then would use that hurt to justify himself any time shitty action taken towards me.

{"text": "Aside from bodily harm or physically abusive behaviors, I also draw the line at any sort of bodyshaming, verbal berating, or emotional abuse in the form of control and stonewalling.\n\nMy long-term ex bf, for example, isolated me from my family, made me spiral into months long depression and stop eating/sleeping properly, caused me to have a miscarriage and didn't comfort me in the aftermath, and cheated on me. This was all during covid isolation, so as soon as I moved out and we broke up, he went and joined that chick he was sneaking around with. Before that, when I came to pack, I broke down crying and explained how bad I felt when I was alone and bleeding that day, and he didn't realize the impact it had on me. He shed some alligator tears and said sorry, gave me my leftover mail I had at his place, then I never saw him again.\n\nI ended up moving to the other side of the country and am dating another man. As I now know through a mutual friend who shared pictures, my ex is married to this girl, and she's pregnant soon to be having their first son. I don't believe he changed, and a part of me wishes I could tell her how he treated me, especially when I lost  my pregnancy, and how he left me in my most vulnerable moments to compulsively binge eat and play video games all night long. \n\nHe didn't do the work when I dumped him, so a part of me also believes he repeats the same behaviors with her now. Either way, I am with someone better who treats me right, and that's what I choose to focus on.", "label": 0}

I feel like I saw a side I shouldn't have when I hosted her at mine and her ex would pop in everyday. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nHer ex literally did everything she asked for and beyond, but it still wasn't enough for her. She said she didn't know what she wanted, but felt she still wasn't getting enough love. I told her she needed to figure that shit out before it was too late. Because he was actually a good guy. Well, he left before they hit 6 months. The sad thing is she kept trying to paint him as evil and the bad guy because she was in denial about things. She's the type of person who can't stand being wrong and always wants to be right... Anyway, this is why people usually say to love yourself before getting in a relationship \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIt's been like 3 years, and she is still not over him. So deep down, she knows she fked up, but still doesn't want to admit she has insecurity problems.

{"text": "She\u2019s 34. She was in really bad relationships from 16-28. She then found someone at 29, and went way too emotionally deep really early on, and the guy shut down. They became F buddies. She worked at home full time through the pandemic, and only started working back in an office a year ago. She is socially anxious and has a very specific type that she goes for. She\u2019s very picky on what she likes about a man, and also the way he looks (which is fair, but limits her options). She\u2019s always mentioned that she\u2019s not as good looking as most of her friends, so guys don\u2019t choose her out of the crowd (I don\u2019t agree with that). Now at 34, the dating pool is small, and a lot of the guys she goes on dates with either turn her off, or they\u2019re not into her.\u00a0\n\nI feel for her because she really wants to have someone. Her first major boyfriend of 5 years was emotionally abusive and really did a number on her. Her second boyfriend of 3 years was good until he wasn\u2019t, and she couldn\u2019t be herself around him. I think now when she\u2019s dating, she steers guys away when she\u2019s so emotionally open right off the bat. I think she needs to broaden her horizons in terms of men, and try to learn not to see someone\u2019s imperfections right away. I think she has to work on her confidence when around someone new (but I totally get how hard this is because I\u2019m socially anxious in new situations too). She\u2019s getting into soccer and getting out there, I think she just needs to lower her expectations over a guy\u2019s physical appearance, not be so quick to judge if they say or do anything that she\u2019s unsure of, and she needs to play coy a little bit in the beginning so the guy doesn\u2019t run.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m also an astrology nut, so she\u2019s been dealing with gnarly astrology transits in her place of relationships, marriage, and affection. I see some major transformation coming soon over her ability to express herself, and some major healing and moving on from her relationship trauma over the next few years.
