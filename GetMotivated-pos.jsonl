{"text": "There is nothing negative about pointing out that this doesn't work for everyone despite the meme using such wording.

Posts like this can be demoralizing for people who struggle with executive function disorders. \n\nNo one asked you to make assumptions or give any input about my partner. You chose to do that, and you didn't even ask for any clarifying information before just assuming that if they struggle to execute a plan they \"probably never had a goal to begin with\". I'd say you were the one being negative. Take care. Have a good day. Try to make fewer assumptions from an abelist perspective if you want to be seen as helpful.", "label": 1}

{"text": "You kind of remind me of myself at that age. And when I look back at that period of my life, I realize that I just didn\u2019t know who I was yet. I\u2019m not going to read other comments here, I just want to let you know what changed in my life and what pushed that change along.\n\nThe absolute most most most important thing is confidence. Right now it\u2019s tied to social status, and the level of interest in you from women. So you need to find something else you\u2019re proud of, start overachieving at work, or studies. And with work, start taking certification courses that are in your job field. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re already going to the gym and playing more soccer. Join an adult league in your area, go get beers with the team after a game. \n\nYou need to have a schedule full of things you enjoy to do. Let\u2019s say after a soccer game at your new league nobody wants to hangout that night, to be unbothered by that, you need to have something else you\u2019d rather do anyway, like play video games or something. That goes for anything, let\u2019s say a girl cancels a date, you need to be able to not be hung up on it. And the way to do that is to have something else to do that you really enjoy. Start enriching your life with things you truly enjoy doing. Have a schedule for your week. And don\u2019t just build it in a few hours, it\u2019ll take a few weeks for it all to land.\n\nIf you pepper in some social activites into your life, ie soccer league, online gaming, etc you\u2019ll be able to concentrate on keeping your own social battery from draining on your terms. You need to by tying your identity into something else. Whatever you want to be better at, make it part of your identity and say it to yourself. Like with soccer instead of \u201cI\u2019m trying to play more soccer\u201d say to yourself \u201cI\u2019m a soccer player\u201d find the indentity that you want to have and affirm it with your everyday language.\n\nLong story short, you need to find fulfillment, and and identity your proud of. Working on yourself in other ways other than just being better with women. If you do that, everything else will fall into place. Also don\u2019t worry too much if it\u2019s not happening the way you want. 23 is also a tough age and a tough period of life, you\u2019ll find who you are eventually", "label": 1}

{"text": "I hear you, and what you're feeling is completely normal. Your cousin gave you some tough but real advice - thinking long-term is important. But here's the thing: feeling weak doesn't mean you are weak. Everyone goes through periods of low confidence and uncertainty.\n\nStart small - pick one goal you can work on this week. Could be learning about a new career path, updating your resume, or even just reading about financial planning. You don't have to figure everything out at once. The key is to start moving forward, even if it's just baby steps.\n\nYour cousin is right that emotions shouldn't hold you back, but don't be too hard on yourself either. You're already showing strength by recognizing you want to change. Focus on progress, not perfection. The past is done - what matters is what you do next.\n\nRemember: Every successful person started somewhere, and many felt just as lost as you do now. You've got this! \ud83d\udcaa", "label": 1}

{"text": "Your cousin\u2019s right, though \u2013 sometimes you need that wake-up call to really see where you\u2019re heading. But it\u2019s also normal to feel lost; everyone goes through it, even if they don\u2019t show it. What\u2019s helped me when I feel like giving up is just focusing on one tiny thing I can do, something that reminds me I\u2019m still moving, even if it\u2019s slow. Like, maybe I can\u2019t fix everything today, but I can take one small step. And forgiving yourself for past mistakes? That\u2019s huge. It\u2019s hard, but letting go of that baggage makes it easier to move forward. You got this, one small step at a time.", "label": 1}
