Not that it is impossible to hold on to, it\u2019s just the the modern empires (USA and USSR) haven\u2019t been able to hold it due to a fundamental shift in how they operate in the area.\n\nHistorically there were two main ways of holding onto a conquered territory: consistent use of force and cultural conversion over the course of several generations/100-150 years or so.

{"text": "> why does the customer pay tax to the seller and not the government directly?\n\nBecause it's an adminstrative nightmare. \n\nIn terms of books and records and all that jazz, it's just SO MUCH easier for the vendor of a product to remit the sales tax (it's important that we call this a sales tax so as not to be confused with an income tax).  \n\nThe vendor is already reporting their revenues and expenses as part of their income tax, so it's easy for the government to check that report compared to the sales tax report to make sure the company is properly charging the tax.  It's actually one of the first things that I learned to do when I was just starting out prepping corporate tax, doing an HST (A Canadian sales tax) \"reasonably\" calculation. \n\nThe second thing, is that many sales taxes are actually better described as a \"value added tax\".  The difference between a sales tax and a VAT is that with a sales tax, you are only supposed to charge it to the \"end user\" of a product or service.  So there's complicated documentation and reporting requirements for businesses that sell items to other businesses. \n\nWith a VAT, everyone pays the tax (not just end users) so the documentation requirements are less.  BUT the business gets to claim a credit for all the tax that it paid, and only remits to the government the difference between what it paid and what it charged. \n\nFor example,  if I'm a company who makes and sells a \"thing\" for $100 and the VAT is 15%.  For every thing I sell, I send $15 to the government.\n\nExcept, that thing I had to purchase the raw materials.  Those raw materials cost $75, and I paid (15% VAT) so $11.25 on that purchase.\n\nWhen I prepare my sales tax return (actually VAT return).  I would show $15 collected, and $11.5 paid meaning I only send $3.75 to the government.\n\nThis process gets repeated all the way up the supply chain.  Eventually it gets to the company that mined the minerals that went into producing the item.  They, of course, paid no VAT on things that they dig out of the ground but there's other things like supplies or equipment that they would have paid VAT on when purchased. \n\nI know it sounds like a VAT system is a lot more paperwork, but it's actually a lot less and it's also fairly easy for governments to double check that the companies are reporting it properly. \n\n> I know that i must be missing something huge here, please someone educate me \ud83d\ude4f\n\nWhat you are missing here is that you are thinking of money as being belonging to the person who holds it.  But the reality here is that the vendor is collecting the money on behalf of the government, technically it doesn't really belong to them.\n\nIn Canada, an unpaid HST (our form of VAT) amount is one of the few things that a companies board of directors is personally liable for.  If they fail to pass along the money that they collected, and the corporation goes bankrupt, the directors themselves pay the HST out of their own pockets.  It's one of the only things that automatically \"pierce the corporate vail\" as it's known.  \n\nThe company is only holding the money on behalf of the government.  And most companies of any significant size are required to pay this HST money monthly.  Smaller companies can do it quarterly or even yearly, but that's uncommon since the thresholds are actually pretty low in the grand scheme of companies money.", "label": 0}

In a world where weaker nations were colonized, conquered, or exploited by mainly western European nations, you are inevitably going to see a backlash, some kind of ideology or unifying idea that sets itself in opposition to the dominant ideology, which is powerful enough to unify enough people to have genuine political revolutions. The reaction to imperialism and empire is nationalism. The reaction to liberal, Christian, capitalist democracies, is communism or Islam, both providing powerful unifying ideological frameworks. \n\nIran had been flirting a bit with socialism. There were some socialist parties, and the Prime Minister Muhammad Mossedegh was leading a push to remove foreign influence from the country, while further increasing quality of living.

The issue is that as part of his policies to remove foreign influence, he nationalized the holdings of British Petroleum in Iran. \n\nSuffice to say, this rather pissed off Britain and the US during the Cold War.

And empires tend to have a very clear lifecycle to them... as they expand more, the spoils from the winning fuels growth and more conquests... until there is nothing left to take (which is more often than not limited by technology for travel and communications)... and then they run into a wall, because suddenly there are no more spoils to fuel the growth, while the expenses start to climb to maintain all that territory. They tend to sort of burn themselves out that way, and Afghanistan seems like exactly the kind of place where modern empires would find their limit of possible influence/size.

While you can cook it to a temperature to kill the bacteria and it will be safe to eat, it'll taste, look and feel quite gross and you will not want to eat it or serve it to anyone for consumption\n\nThen there are bacteria that produce heat resistant toxins that are very dangerous to humans and should not be consumed.

{"text": "The purpose of a blood type *at all* is to help your body identify foreign invaders by having \"name tags\" for the cells that are you. If your immune system encounters something that doesn't have your name tag on it, then it must be foreign, which means it's probably dangerous or at very least not supposed to be in there.\n\nHumans have evolved to have many tags, but the main two are the Rh factor (positive - you have it; negative - you don't), and the ABO types (having A, or B, or both, or neither).\n\nHaving more tags makes it easier for your body to identify YOU, so it's easier to identify NOT YOU. However, your immune system isn't intelligent and sometimes it gets confused. The ID tags on your own cells are meant to stand out. If your immune system gets confused, those blood types can be big neon signs that your own immune system attacks. It can also lead to your immune system becoming more paranoid, since it makes foreign invaders stand out a bit more. Some studies have suggested that different blood types are more prone to developing certain allergies. A and B types may come with additional clotting factors, leading to an increase in risk for heart disease, and maybe risks for certain cancers.\n\nSo, you can hopefully see that there are advantages to having more or certain \"ID tags\"; and, there are benefits to having fewer. With no evolutionary pressure pushing in one direction, humans have survived by having a variety. A problem or disease that is great at infecting or hurting certain blood types won't be able to harm everyone. This may create a strong pressure to *keep* the variety of types, to provide a latent herd immunity. Diseases have to be able to hide from your immune system, which often means mimicking your ID tags to sneak in. A disease that evolves to mimic one blood type won't be able to spread to someone with a different blood type, slowing down the rate of infection and protecting everyone.", "label": 0}

{"text": "There are a lot of variables at play here so it\u2019s hard to give a definitive answer. For example, this will depend on the yield of the bomb, the height it was detonated at and its physical relationship to subway entrances. It will even depend on how the subway entrance was designed and thus whether the wind made it down there. You could also run into problems with things like ruptured gas lines, so in a subway station you could avoid being turned into vapour but still burn.\n\nFrom history though, we have heard of some interesting survival stories. As an example, when Hiroshima was bombed a woman survived the blast in a bank vault half a kilometre (horizontally) from the blast location. Her name is Atiko Takakura and you can read her story.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that you would be safer during a blast in a subway than if you were on the street. But if you survive the blast, you have only survived the instantaneous death phase.\u00a0\n\nAfterwards is when the real problems would start. Humans can survive about a week without water and maybe up to two or three months without food. Because of how nuclear bombs work, even getting out of the subway would be difficult. If you got out, you would have to find safe drinking water. And you would eventually have to find food. Knowing what I know of human nature, I suspect that food and water would be competitive.\n\nSo long term survival really depends on how widespread the nuclear attack was and whether any aid will actually make it to you. And failing that, it depends on whether you are the kind of person to compete others to death to secure enough resources to survive.\n\nAs for cities, again it depends on how widespread the attack is. A historically neutral country might give better odds of survival because they\u2019re less likely to be hit. But overall, I think you would have the best chance of survival in a rural area, especially if you know people, have long term roots and own land.\u00a0\n\nBut then, that again depends on how widespread the attack was. Assuming a widespread attack, you would likely see the world cooling by an average of ten degrees for a decade. You may not have access to crops that will even grow in the post nuclear climate. At which point, you\u2019re really trading a quick death for a slow and painful one.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Sure, our rate of population growth is slowing. That has meant that we are adding approximately the same number of people to the planet each decade for the last 50 years, around 800 million per decade. As the less developed parts of the world become more developed we can expect their growth rates to decline, while at the same time their standard of living and resource demands increase.\n\nOur growth rate is expected to drop by 1 or 2% by 2030, so let\u2019s carry that out a few decades at something like -1.6% change per decade. That puts us crossing 10B people around 2070 and stabilizing. Now what do we do when those 10B people all want to live like the US and EU, currently about 800M people? There is no amount of recycling that makes it possible for us to build 12 times as much of everything. Or 10. Or probably 2.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t using up these resources, it is that the limited amounts of these resources available to use restricts the amount of items we can produce and thus the standard of living for people. As those resources become more and more scarce, we will become more accepting of habitat destruction, human displacement and suffering, and unrestricted capitalism to feed our demand for materials. It is the same reason we have wars today: in a world of scarcity, not everyone can have everything they want.\n\nI am quite optimistic about humanity, as I think we can overcome these challenges.

{"text": "The simplest answer is that Afghanistan\u2019s function \u2014 or, at least, the function that modern empires want it to have \u2014 in the global imperial system is as a buffer zone. I\u2019m pretty sure the idea that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires started with the British Empire\u2019s experience there. But a lot of what we think of as \u201cstandard features of empire\u201d started with the British Empire.\n\nSo, part of the premise of empire is that if you have one, it can and maybe has to expand indefinitely, conquering territory whose resources it can harness as it goes. But there\u2019s a problem: the earth is finite. In the late 19th century, when the British Empire was already well established pretty much all over the globe, the Russian Empire started expanding rapidly south and east through Central Asia. The British were watching this rival empire, as they watched all other European empires, and their intelligence services got worried that Russia would find an overland route to British India. The lands that we now call Afghanistan were in between the British and Russian imperial frontiers, so the British got really focused on it.\n\nAs many others have pointed out, Afghanistan is super mountainous and actually getting an invading army all the way through that territory would have been extremely hard and maybe impossible. But the point is, in the 19th century, no one operating in service of a European empire really knew *what* was possible because that part of the world hadn\u2019t been mapped. So, very long story short, the British invaded Afghanistan because they wanted to install a puppet ruler whom they knew would be loyal to them, just in case Russia decided to make a play for either control of Afghanistan, or for an invasion route into British India. It\u2019s important to note that this was a little bit different from a colonial-type invasion. The British didn\u2019t really want to exploit Afghanistan\u2019s resources; they just wanted to set up a semi-friendly area between themselves and the Russian Empire. The Afghans were not thrilled about being invaded and they had a massive home team advantage, in part due to that mountainous topography everyone keeps talking about, and they dealt the British Empire a humiliating defeat in the first Anglo-Afghan War. Then came a series of revenge invasions that basically lasted until the British Empire collapsed, and made both countries gradually poorer and more chaotic, but with worse effects for Afghanistan, predictably, than for Britain.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Russia was ever planning to invade British India via Afghanistan in the 19th century, but Britain\u2019s anxiety about it is in no small part responsible for establishing modern Afghanistan as a buffer zone in a bit more conceptual a sense. When Britain recognized finally Afghanistan as an independent nation, it adopted the borders that Russia and Britain had earlier agreed would be a \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d between their respective spheres of influence. Since then, whenever the global balance of power is shifting, someone who feels threatened visits violence on Afghanistan, much to the detriment of the people who live there, but also usually to the detriment of the empire-of-the-moment.\n\nThe USSR in the 1980s wasn\u2019t really at the height of its power. Even though the Cold War had settled into some form of stability, the Soviet Union was facing a lot of internal pressure from the effects of years of government corruption, citizens\u2019 growing access to and interest in the West, and the lack of a unifying moral compass that WWII had provided. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first country to invent a war to try to produce domestic social cohesion (and there\u2019s a strong argument that it did exactly that in Afghanistan). But also, at that time, Afghanistan was having its own internal struggles between the forces of Western capitalism and supporters of local tradition, some of whom sided with the Soviet socialists because they were opposed to the West. Re: the US and \u201cIslamic terrorism,\u201d the story is even less rooted in territorial dispute, but once again featured a global superpower using Afghanistan to stage a battle between the status quo (US hegemony) and an upstart threat.\n\nOP had a really good question and the answer is complicated.

{"text": "Other folks have touched on the survivability of the bomb itself, so I'd like to focus on the aftermath and what that might look like. We start by assuming you're in a city and happen to be in a shelter of some kind, either a basement, a proper shelter, or a subway. We also assume (however unrealistically), that the city is hit by a nuclear weapon directly. It's unlikely a nation-state would target a population center in such a manner, but maybe a terrorist cell might? In any case, the city you're in just got nuked. Further, we have to assume that the nuke was large enough, or the city small enough, to be nuked in such a manner as to be reflective of a nuked city in a video game, which also indicates an enormous strategic nuke was used, or many smaller nukes. \n\nIf we're assuming it was a nation state attack, it would likely be an air burst explosion, intended to topple buildings. There would not be much risk from radioactive fallout in such a scenario, so likely you'd be safe from radioactivity at least, so long as you spend a bit underground before poking your head out. At least, so long as you aren't entombed under many tons of fallen concrete. Assuming it was a terrorist attack however, means that the weapon would more likely be detonated at ground level. That means that if you're underground near the blast center, sorry, you'd still be dead. But that's not fun, so let's assume you aren't at the blast center. Yes, you'd likely survive. What then?\n\nYour most immediate concern is water. Without water, you're dead in a matter of days. And given the fallout outside, you're unlikely to be able to wait out the water situation. Any water outside, given your proximity to the blast site and the no longer functioning water mains, is going to be highly radioactive. Congrats on your cancer. But maybe you somehow had access to weeks worth of freshwater in your underground shelter. \n\nYour next concern is your neighbors. Any that survived are going to be seeking shelter from the radioactivity. Is your location well known? Say welcome to your new roommates for the next week or two. Hope they didn't track in too much irradiated dust. \n\nAfter that, food. This largely presents the same problem as the water situation. If you have some, it should be safe, assuming your new neighbors haven't eaten you out of house and home. Otherwise, you're going to have to venture outside to get some within the first 3 weeks or so. The radiation in the air outside will have calmed down a bit, but everything else is fucked. Any food you eat is likely to be highly contaminated. No one is storing food in lead cans. And that's assuming every shelf hasn't already been looted to total depletion. Your average urban supermarkets keep enough supply on hand for 3-7 days at most, and given what we learned about toilet paper during COVID, it would all already be long gone. \n\nBut say you have enough food and water in your shelter, and no one knows about it except you. After 2-3 weeks stuck underground, you finally emerge back into the world outside. The sunlight hurts your eyes after lack of exposure for so long. Your muscles may have atrophied after not seeing enough use. And now...now you get to have the fun experience of working your way out of the city on foot. No cars will be functioning due to EMP. And even if they were, the roads are choked with other cars and debris regardless. You're likely going to spend at least a day or two hiking out of the city, while trying not to touch anything. Any other survivors are for sure desperate at this point, and will be eyeing you hungrily, especially if you have on a pack of some kind. So you'll want to avoid people while you avoid touching anything. \n\nFinally, as you move out of the city, you're going to deal with the miles-long trail of bloated corpses, swarming with flies and disease. Because all of the people that didn't die in the blast but weren't lucky to be in a bunker with food and supplies? They all started making that same hike you did, but days earlier. Most of them died of thirst, starvation, radiation burns, but some were probably just straight up murdered as well. They're all dead. Hope you remembered to bring a couple of facemasks so you aren't breathing in that polluted, putrid air. \n\nThat's the reality of a nuclear attack on a city center.

It becomes possible to \"hack\" the voting machines and manipulate them so they give an output different from what the voter indicated.\n\nBlockchain is not a magic bullet for anything trust related.

The actual facts of how blockchain tech has been used show us that, while it may have some uses as a public ledger, it is simply *not* capable of being a trust-free system. People can exploit, and *already have exploited,* the \"trust-free\" nature of blockchain technology to deceive people and to commit actual crimes.

{"text": "So the long and short of it is this: \n\nA candy bar, or a sugary processed snack oftentimes doesn\u2019t have the vitamin and nutrient content to make it beneficial over a fruit with similar sugar per serving. \n\nSugar is good in moderate amounts, but what REALLY is great about fruit is readily bio-available vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber. \nPineapple as an example is very high in vitamin c, is a good source of manganese, and has enzymes in it that aid in digestion. \n\nPlant food usually has a high water content and can aid in hydration / absorption of nutrients (because your body needs that hydration in order to properly process things, and to cleanse toxins using your kidneys.) \nTotal water content per day is usually summed up as how many glasses of water you need, but hydration as a whole takes a few things into account: \n- are you getting your necessary salts/sugars? (Your body requires salts (and sugars) in different forms in order to draw the water you process into your cells. That\u2019s why herbivores often times need salt licks, or they will have to find salt in other forms like carrion / small animal prey. It\u2019s a necessary nutrient for life for almost every organism on this planet. You just don\u2019t want to have so much salt that your body\u2019s water reserves are drawn out and you can\u2019t replenish them. That\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s all a balancing act that our bodies try to maintain - hence why having a diet that focuses on whole food when possible and practices moderation of any extreme is good, it lets your body do it\u2019s automatic processes to achieve hydrated equilibrium.)  \n- also are you getting your necessary hydration from not just drinking water-based liquids or water? \n- and does your diet include eating foods with high water content? \n\n\nFiber is useful because it bulks up your stool while keeping it soft, so that when you go to poop you don\u2019t strain over the toilet and don\u2019t need to push hard. \nTmi I\u2019m sure but folks need to know this: Pushing isn\u2019t what people actually should be doing. It should just slide out when it\u2019s ready and you release your sphincter muscles. It shouldn\u2019t be painful, burning, crampy, or difficult to do. \nThe only exceptions are for people who have medical conditions that interfere with that. Otherwise you should be conscious of what foods you\u2019re eating and ensure you\u2019re getting enough fiber and plant food in your diet. (If you\u2019re not and need a supplement maybe look into betterfiber? It\u2019s a plant based powder that dissolves entirely Into water (and can be mixed into almost anything but carbonated stuff.) and doesn\u2019t have a flavor.

{"text": "Nobody is \"wholly\" anything. Your non-European ancestors did not contribute a meaningful proportion of your current DNA.\n\nUp to statistical variance, effectively all people of *any* European descent whatsoever are blood relatives of Charlemagne--but almost none of us have any meaningful proportion of Charlemagne's DNA.\n\nThe only people whose DNA particularly matters for you, personally, are going to be those within about a 300-400 year time span before your birth and after your final child is born. Before that span, you're looking approximately 12 generations back, meaning only about 2^-12 of your genes come from any given lineage (note, you'll almost certainly have a few duplicate ancestors across that span, but not very many). 1/2^12 is 1/4096, or 0.0244%. Even if a single ancestor appeared ten distinct times, they'd only *on average* contribute about a quarter of one percent of your overall DNA.\n\nThe reason AB is rare is not because it can't be inherited. It's because you need to be having *regular, frequent* intermixing: it comes from having one parent give you the A gene and the other parent give you the B gene. It's quite possible that a few very rare people had it back in Ye Olden Dayse, but the reason it stayed more-or-less isolated is because it requires sustained population intermixing.\n\nE.g., someone who has AB blood can give either A or B to their children. Let's say a Chinese woman migrated to eastern Europe (say, Turkey) and stayed there. Her genotype is BB, and thus her phenotype is B. She marries a local Turkish man, who has genotype AA and thus phenotype A. All of their six children will necessarily end up having AB blood. Each of those six children marries a local Turkish spouse (essentially guaranteed to be genotype AA). This means that, for each child, about half of their children will inherit AA, and the other half will inherit AB.\n\nEach generation, you only get about half as many children getting the new genes. It could theoretically linger for quite some time, but eventually, it's going to die out purely due to statistics: half of half of half of half (etc.) eventually falls to zero, when working with discrete counts. As a result, you would have an ever-growing population of Turkish people who have a Chinese ancestor, but do not have AB blood. Same can happen in the reverse direction, someone from China having a Turkish ancestor who makes a small and dwindling population of AB descendants.", "label": 0}

Just like how weird snaking lines can carve out certain groups and make things unfair, drawing lines in any arbitrary way can also do this, even if it is not malicious.  \n\n\nLet's simplify things and assume that we are going to have 2 districts in a given area, and there are 2 cities (and rural populations) in the area. If you just drew an arbitrary grid system you could end up with:\n\nGood Scenario: District #1 contains City A, District #2 contains City B. Each district represents a cohesive interest group (the residents of one city), and the representative that gets elected will have an easier time serving their constituents\n\nBad Scenario: District #1 and District #2 each have 1/2 of City A and 1/2 of City B. This is kind of a terrible situation where each representative will have to try to balance the residents of each city against each other. \n\n\n\nUltimately, geography is messy, and this is why 'simple' fixes are usually not a perfect solution.

Making individual districts get representation based on their voter share, or making sure that the total roll-up in whatever body we're voting for has overall representation share? The US is set up so that in individual states each district gets represented based on itself and itself alone.

Anyone with tails sits down and is done; anyone with heads stays standing and flips again. There are people in the crowd who would get lucky and get ten heads in a row.\n\nQuantum immortality is tied to the Many Worlds theory - the idea that every quantum decision spins off a parallel universe. A universe where a flipped coin landed heads, and a universe where it landed tails. Obviously we ourselves only see one universe at a time, but these other universes exist and are just as real (according to the theory).\n\nQuantum immortality is then specifically built by building out a Schrodinger's Cat type of experiment where your own death state is \"translated\" into a quantum mechanics event, where you don't know what's actually happened until you look. The idea with Many Worlds theory is that then once you DO look, there's a universe where you survive and a universe where you don't. Extrapolate out, there's a universe where you ALWAYS live; a universe where you never die.\n\nIt's like that sports stadium, but if you flip tails you die.\n\nThe reason it's most likely not true is that it sort of depends on a slight misunderstanding of the idea underlying Schrodinger's Cat. That was originally meant to be a way to show how ridiculous a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics is, but over time it's become accepted among non-physicists as \"totally what quantum physics is you guys\".

Yes, tone is important, but it's not like language was specifically engineered to be as efficient as possible upon its inception- tone is efficient, but how do you intuitively convey it in written form? If we need to capture something expressed through tone, we can use words that incorporate inflectional or formative morphemes, add descriptive adjectives, or visually modify the text to imply tone.\n \n    On paper (pun intented), this might seem like a decent enough hinderance that you'd think we'd address it, but the rules, technics, and conventions we use to help us communicate better have mostly came along organically for a reason. What's managed to stick around the best throughout generations has been what works best intuitively or proves the most versatile for general use.\n\n  Perhaps we've came far along enough now that we can fix certain fringe cases, but language and the genesis of its written forms predate the modern era of studying and teaching it. With that in mind, it\u2019s easy to see why our current approach is to simply use the tools that have evolved in language if there's any issues.
