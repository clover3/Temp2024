Q cut his teeth playing jazz trumpet in the early '50s, when a few big bands still existed. He had to be a fluent sight reader, and he had a context for knowing how arrangements \"work.\" He was surrounded by surviving big-band-era jazz musicians who were amazing musicians. That kind of incubator hardly exists today.\n\nI just finished the Joni Mitchell biography yesterday. Amazing talent. It's a pity she blew her soprano range smoking four packs a day. And it's a pity she's been so outspoken. In quote after quote, she says hateful things about just about everyone. Knowing when to shut up would have helped her.
