A 401(k) or IRA in the market will produce yields far in excess of what you put into Social Security.\n\nIt's not a self-sustaining program in the way that individual retirement savings are; it assumes that a substantial fraction of the population will not be able to save adequately for retirement and needs help, so it taxes current workers who outnumber current retirees. Well-off people will pay in far more than they ever get paid out, and that redistribution is absolutely the point. In the days before Social Security, the majority of older adults lived in poverty after they couldn't work. Many would have to live with family or in the poorhouse to get by. \n\nSocial Security actually remains the single most effective government program at lifting people out of poverty.

Within this bottom 15 you also have 5 states with 25% or less gun ownership, and 3 with sub 15% ownership rates. So of the 15 states with the lowest gun homicide rates, 10 have very high gun ownership rates, and 5 have very low ownership rates; yet the gun homicide rates in each of these 15 states is very similar and very low.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Idaho and North Dakota are 5 of the states with the lowest gun homicide rates, while all having gun ownership rates which vary from 40%-60%. Their gun homicide rates are similar to those seen in Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, UK, and several others.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yeah this is apples to oranges. I think any sane person would say that violent lawlessness is a bigger problem than loose gun laws. So far we're priveleged in the US to rarely experience the former. \n\nStudies from WWII have found that the bulk of atrocities, civilian deaths etc came in [lawless regions of Soviet territories](https://researchportal.murdoch.edu.au/esploro/outputs/graduate/Lawlessness-in-the-occupied-Soviet-territories/991005542125407891), this offers a good, and horrifying, example of these situation at its extreme: \n\n>  Both the German and Soviet regimes can be understood to have deliberately undermined the restraints that would have helped prevent these crimes from occurring. Judicial restraints were nullified with the war on the frontlines distancing itself from international law and the norms of war. Psychological and moral restraint was undermined with both regimes' official ideologies conceiving of the occupied civilians as innately criminal. Finally, a further aspect of judicial restraint was countered as fighters were not heavily punished for individualistic crimes against the civilian population.\n\n> With these restraints removed, the overwhelming picture of the rear areas is one of lawlessness. Fighters from both forces of the security war had absolute authority over the occupied civilians and often exploited them to a horrific degree. Both forces can be seen as having converged against the civilian population and a full understanding of the occupied experience seems incomplete without recognition of this. This convergence also highlights similarities between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union with both, otherwise-opposed, ideologies manifesting themselves in comparable ways in the rear areas.", "label": 0}

The states that are shaded darker like Missouri (St. Louis) Louisiana (New Orleans, Baton Rouge) Tennessee (Memphis) have higher rates of gun deaths because of criminal activity and gangs clustered in the ghettos.

Do you support this sort of rhetoric?\n\nI dont but trump doesnt and will never have power to actually do it. We also had trump for 4 years and we know what to expect. In absolute worst case scenario, lets say he wants to become a dictator, it is extremely easy to assasinate him and continue with democracy. Democrats are much bigger threat as they actually have the power and are using it. They are well oil machine, like every candidate is basically the same repeating same phrases and sentences democrats also have almost 100% control over colleges, news media and social media. They are also actively importing 100 000s of illegal immigrants in swing states to decide the vote, basically making it democracy only on paper.

{"text": "True and recent polls and the methodology review and deep dive on stats I've been doing off and on shows some significant problems with the current way polls are accomplished. Polls make too many assumptions, rely too heavily on subjective likelihood a registered voter will actually vote. They also suck at reaching a proper demographic of voters. Truth is the voters they have been reaching are older, more conservative, richer, and more vocal.\n\nThe difference between the biased, and in some cases based on the demographics data of some polls, possibly fabricated polling we are seeing right now is something a person could research. Meanwhile betting market data is influenced by a lot of factors. Factors that can be manipulated by donors ... accusations that Musk has been manipulating these markets seems likely. We can't always see what is going on behind the scenes, and even when we can the delay means the damage is already done by relying on these.", "label": 0}
