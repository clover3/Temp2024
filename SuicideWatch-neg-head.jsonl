I don't mean someone who makes posts that get likes on the internet, but someone who behaves and acts in a way that you respect?  \n  There is so much focus on the superficial, and it's leading to mental health crisis.  You've done things to be proud of, but I just see an obsession with appearance in your post (and I know there is more to you than the contents of a short post on reddit), but I think a lot of people have never been tested.  They've never faced difficult situations and prevailed, and the privilege of western society is keeping people from gaining important insight into who they are, so they're stuck focusing on the external.  And it keeps them from practicing active gratitude.  I hope you are able to find the happiness you are searching for someday.", "label": 0}

Some people are jailed for their whole lives for a crime they didn\u2019t commit. \n\nSo these are two things you have going for you. \n\n1. You are able bodied.\n2. You have your freedom. \n\nAnd yes you are at rock bottom as you see it for people who are able and are free. And god knows the difficulties you face tomorrow. \n\nBut you will face it and you will survive. You will have to find some way of getting money together, and only do it legally. \n\nBecause the third thing you have is your character. Your integrity. Your values. \n\nThis may sound abstract but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s absolutely critical to life. Some people have billions of dollars, but they have no character they can respect when they look in the mirror, and end up walking that freeway in an Armani suit. \n\nThe fact is that some people give up everything to get to the reality of life. All the bullshit can be like a weight around your neck. From Buddha to Socrates, the greatest thinkers have put themselves in a situation just like yours, giving up everything and living wild, for one reason: they knew that what is inside is the only thing that matters at all. \n\nWhen you leave that motel room, hell I know it will be terrifying. But remember this: you will be in the same position that some of the greatest minds in history voluntarily put themselves in, because they craved the freedom to be good people unburdened by the world. \n\nI hope you find a way to get back into a home, and sort the practical issues of getting money together.

{"text": "Whatever the reality of what you are living through, there are some things I can say for sure. \n\nFirstly, you are using really extreme language to describe your situation and yourself. Many people don\u2019t realise that extreme language is not just a response of strong emotion, it\u2019s also a cause of it. It can be a cause of false beliefs and extremely strong feelings. Think about how sports teams get themselves fired up with language. By calling yourself a parasite, nothing, saying you have fucked up your whole life, you are doing the same thing but negatively. \n\nIs there any better way of speaking about yourself than absolutely objectively, without any coloured language, descriptions, and especially not absolutes or extreme terms. Maybe write down what is wrong with your life in your view but with absolutely no vivid description, extremity, or even judgment. You have to be absolutely rigorous.\n\nSo for example, instead of someone writing \u201cI totally fucked up my relationship, I am a total fuck up and I\u2019m going to spend my whole life alone\u201d, they might write \u201cI caused the end of this relationship by doing x. I think I did so because of y and z. I might not have another relationship, but if I do I will remember the lessons from this one\u201d. Or something similar. \n\nTake the catastrophe out of your language, and maybe your problems will start to seem more real and tangible, and therefore approachable. \n\nThe second thing is that you evidently care for animals. You have the capacity to love, nurture and care for other lives. That is a truly wonderful thing. So many people don\u2019t care at all about others at all. Those people are truly empty, and have a significant struggle ahead of them. \n\nThis love for your pets is the signpost to a great virtue of yours, it sounds.

It\u2019s like minor inconveniences build up & I explode... and then I feel horrible and even\u00a0\nmore suicidal after because of regret of how I acted. It\u2019s like I know it\u2019s irrational but someone else takes the wheel. I become a villain, a monster. I beat myself up, I feel gross in my skin, I get stuck in loops of negative and nihilistic beliefs. I don\u2019t wanna be this way. I push away loved ones and I make myself feel undeserving of care and love. The thoughts get worse when I don\u2019t eat all day of course, but often I simply forget to due to depression or work...\u00a0\n\nWhen I\u2019m at work distracted I\u2019m a completely different person. I bet no one could ever imagine me having the outbursts I do at home. And the only people who know are my mom bf and sister. They don\u2019t know what to do as they\u2019ve dealt with similar things at a point. But I know that my mood swings / episodes are even more irrational/ intense than they may have ever experienced, \u00a0and that makes me feel so isolated. I wouldn\u2019t wish this upon my worst enemy, being at war with yourself daily and being unable to explain why... It\u2019s like I\u2019m holding guilt for something, but what?", "label": 0}

It was a devastating and helpless feeling because there was nothing I could do about it. I felt trapped in an ugly suit that I couldn\u2019t take off. But then in my mid-late 20s, my bone structure settled and I started suddenly getting compliments on my appearance. Our musculoskeletal system continues to change over our lives, which I didn\u2019t know before. It was very strange to me to get compliments. I rejected many of them in my mind or just thought they pitied me and were being nice. Also, beauty standards seem to change like the wind. When I was a kid, being rail thin was considered ideal, but overtime that has changed and now my figure, which is thicker, is like what people are literally paying thousands of dollars for.
