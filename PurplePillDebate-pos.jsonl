The stigma of women reporting mental illness is not as socially detrimental. So they seek help more. \n\nWomen reporting & asking for mental health services does NOT EQUAL \"women are more mentally ill than men or in comparison to the past\". \n\nYou: Bing AI said from these research articles I never bothered to read the discussions & methods say this about women. \n\nMe: as a one time academic specialist in the past,  AI is not a good tool to look up research articles bc AI is machine learning and gets updated once a year bc it has to be fed information & then tested on its responses (it is not always accurate) even Ai companies will tell you to do independent research. which is why universities do not recommend it for students to use AI as a source to find research articles. \n\nYou: well this one study said lesbians and bisexual are the most abusive. \n\nMe: the study in question asked if women who are bisexual or lesbian have ever been in an abusive relationship. \n\nIt did NOT ask what the gender of their ex partner was from that abusive relationship. Notably because bisexual women overwhelming date men. Bc lesbians are still a minority. \n\nSo it is not accurate to use that study that lesbian and bisexual are abusive. Bc it doesn't specify if they were in relationships with men prior. Just ask if they had experienced domestic abuse.\n\nYou: well liberal/leftist women report 51% on being on anti-depressants. \n\nMe: yes bc these political ideologies enable and foster a space to openly about mental illness. \n\nConservativism/right wing does not foster a space to talk about mental health issues as it is seen as a moral failing. So they are less likely to come forward when talking about mental illness. \n\nIn conclusion you simply do not have the capacity to understand what you are reading bc you do not understand confounding factors and you mistake correlation for causation and use bing ai as a reputable source for your misguided attempts at low level thinking to justify that women are unhappier now then they have ever been but only because they are coming forward with their issues, seeking help and there is less social stigma on depression and other mentally illnesses. \n\nIf you still continue to struggle I suggest you seek help with a special needs tutor (genuinely not an insult) bc you seem to be struggling with fundamental reading comprehension basics.", "label": 1}

Its hard to set boundaries to the level of friendship you want to engage it, unlike sex where everybody understand that no means no.\n\nMany times, I have been in the awkward situations where I was single, friends with a woman, and had to explain to her that while I DO like her as a person, she is asking too much of me. We are close, but not THAT close, unless sex is involved. THere is a whole host of things Im not doing for a woman, unless we are sexual partners.\n\nAnother thing is; if she and I are just friends and not fucking, then she is a dude to me. I do not beleive in treating women in any special way, different from the way I would treat a fellow man, unless she and I are intimate, and intimate a lot.\n\nThe whole \"treat her like a princess\" nonsense feels like moronic sexism to me, but I can do it if the \"princess\" turns into a cock hungry nympho in the evening.

Hear me out, it's the millennials and late Gen Z that seem to have really been hit with a lot of factors that just making dating hard for both of them.\n\nThe first being that average women do have access to casual sex with attractive men who won't date them and while it may be better then having no options it still leaves many women unhappy, not saying certain women aren't happy with just hookups but at least from my personal perspective most want to be in relationships or married to men they are attracted to.\n\nThe next is that the biggest reason many young women don't find men attractive is that young men don't make enough money due to how badly the economy is for new grads. If a man wants to have a good salaried job, house, good car(0-5 years old), and no debt that is a lot of work and only those who went into good fields at the right time or had parental support will be on this track and typically it takes longer for men to hit their stride with most of my older male friends only fully moving out and into their own houses in mid to late 20s and often with support for a down payment or some other support measure.\n\nThe next issue is that third spaces have been eliminated and their is now a lack of grace when it comes to young men showing interest. I'm not talking about guys who are cat calling or sending unsolicited pictures on social media or dating apps, many guys are pretty awkward since they don't have experience with approaching/talking to women and I don't really know how to address this problem but I still think it exists.\n\nAny disagreements or things people would like to add?", "label": 1}

Even after ghosting me come back wanting sex or dates. But all cut me off the moment I started being more serious. Brought flowers? Ghosted. Planned dates that were more than just sex and required more effort? Gone. Talk about being exclusive? Gone. They constantly went back to the exes as well. Or they would go off with some fuck boi bartender that was using them for sex.\n\nIt didnt matter if these women were educated. Didnt matter if they were liberal virtue signalers. Didnt matter if they were clubbers or anime nerds. The moment you start to date with Intention all these women just up and vanish. And continue to complain about men not wanting to commit. Women even complain about men not wanting to get to know them while at the same time not wanting anything serious. Like why would a man invest in a relationship that wont go anywhere?\n\nOne date I wont forget was a woman who started dating because her Ex wanted an open relationship and she didnt. So her solution to that? Was to reject me after our first date because I said Id rather date with intention and treat her with respect from day one. Build good habbits from the get go. But she just wanted to date and sleep around. Which begs response... Why break up with your ex? She couldve stayed with him and did EXACTLY shes doing now. She tried to hook up with me that night and I turned her down and went home.\n\nOver that timeframe of dating I went from wanting to get to know people. Going on actual dates and doing activities. Doing hobbies together, planning nice things. Taking the time to reply and make time to spend with them. To just going over for sex and not really even talking to them. Not caring about their lives because it was all meaningless conversation. And doing so I was rewarded 10 fold when it came to getting laid.\n\nI stopped dating about a year ago because i got tired of bothering. Tired of shallow sex.

You can spend years doing akin to what I did in the gym, never really making any progress and doing it all on your own.

{"text": "This tactic isn't even unique to the left. In 2012, in a last-ditch effort to shore up her unpopular campaign, Josefina V\u00e1zquez Mota, then presidential candidate of Mexico's conservative, anti-abortion National Action Party (PAN, which, ironically for a right-wing party, means \"bread\" when said as one syllable) made the following cringe exhortation:\n\n\n\"All you ladies, go out to vote, but don't go alone, go with 15 or 30 other votes, go to the polls early before anyone else, invite your children, your friends, and your partners; woe to any partner who doesn't go because we won't give him hanky-panky for a month!\"\n\n\nBy the way, in Mexico this year in June, there were three major candidates, two of whom were women. Men actually voted one of the two female candidates slightly more than women did (90% vs 88%), and 62% of men voted for the winning left-wing candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, as opposed to 56% of women. In other words, men\u2014even those in a country that's still much more old-school on gender roles compared to much of the West\u2014will happily vote for a left-leaning woman with a genuinely populist agenda whose party doesn't consistently scold and bash men.\n\n\nMaybe the Democratic Party will finally learn that treating men as horrible sinners who need to grovel and beg for forgiveness for the original sin of maleness is not a winning strategy (nor is enabling a genocide). It didn't learn this lesson in 2016, and now it's paying the price.\n\n\nBy the way, I'm a proud hardcore leftist who despises Trump. I am appalled by the overturning of Roe v Wade. However, I'm also appalled by the fact that the first reaction among the feminist left was to blame men, despite the fact that polling consistently shows that men and women have practically identical views on abortion, and that these are determined entirely by one's political orientation and not at all by one's own gender. The issue is certainly not going to be solved by scolding sympathetic left-leaning men and giving right-leaning women a pass.", "label": 1}

Aggressive/sociopathic traits- I dont really need to explain this one. Look at true crime and worship of violent criminals/womanizing assholes etc..\n\n2. Height- they will select height to an extreme, even above other traits like intelligence,kindnjess,and other virtues\n\n3. Brawns over brains\n\n4.Brain wiring- their brain wiring is designed to process emotions more than logic. I am not saying a woman cannot be logical but even within a margin, that's how their brains operate. They are about what's makes them \"feel\" instead what makes \"logical sense\".\n\nI can keep going on and on, but in general, this is accurate. \n\n if women where given absolute power in every from of governance, the only positive would be probably, I mean probably, less violence but that's a big iff.
