{"text": "Pointing out that someone's relationship with their long term prostitute vs. their barber is a lot different does not mean I think Shae isn't capable of causing the execution of Tyrion or Sansa. What I'm saying is how you feel about your barber committing perjury in a trial against you is not the same as the person you slept with damn near everyday for months or years. Sex work is not an equivalent service to hair cutting. If Tyrion's barber told on him he wouldnt be anywhere near as mad at them as he was with Shae. Anyone who refused to testify could've been tortured or killed, and Tyrion knew that. If he was in that situation he would've saved his own ass too.\n\nAdditionally, while She's testimony did help convict him, he was already going to be convicted once the trial started whether she testified or not. And yes she was given money for testifying, but if you think she could've just said no and walked away you are being naive. That is coercion.\n\nI'm not making up what you said, I'm just making the barber do the same shit Shae did, and one of the things in her situation was coercion. You can claim all day she wasn't coerced, but she was coerced. That happened. Think what you want but I'm not arguing with you about facts just because you don't understand the definition. And I don't agree with you that committing perjury in a trial is the same thing as helping kill someone. It just isn't. If it was, a lot more people who've committed perjury in death row or life imprisonment trials would be getting charged with attempted murder. Lying at a trial is not the same thing as physically killing someone yourself. It just isn't. \n\nAnd yes! I still think killing the barber is unnecessary, cruel, and evil. It is not morally justified to kill someone because they humiliated you or committed perjury. It is understandable why Tyrion did that, but it isn't justifiable. It is not good or right. It is unnecessary, cruel, and evil. That is my OPINION. It's okay if you don't share it. As I said before, if you're not getting joy for seeing a woman murdered then you're not the fucking problem.", "label": 1}

I'm not going to add their username but it's from this thread so you can find it. \n\n-\n\n\"Insecurities as a man\"\n\nHe just got mocked, villainized and sentenced to death in a speech that ended with her stating that she forced him to say words that were originally meant to comfort him, now meant to disgrace him.\n\nI can imagine many would snap for instance if their partner complemented them on their \"aquiline features\" or \"regal disposition\" in quiet moments of comfort, and then turned it on them in a criminal trial by calling them a \"vulture looking freak with a weak stance and features\". While Tyrion probably does feel this makes him less of a man, I don't think the fear that your insecurities *as a person* being turned on you by the people you care about at the worst possible time is unique to any race, creed or sex.\n\n-\n\nI don't think this person actually enjoyed Shae's death, but the attempt to justify killing someone by saying many people would snap in that situation is concerning. Just about everyone would be upset, but strangling someone to death over it is NOT normal nor is it justifiable. Everyone has experience humiliation in their lives and most of us do not kill the person who humiliated us. So I was bothered by the implication here, but I'm not saying this commenter actually thinks killing people is okay. \n\n-\n\nThese two comments are why I commented.

{"text": "Retrospectively I can see why some are interpreting this as a shit-post, but no, I did intend this question genuinely. I think it\u2019s a relatively straightforward and appropriate question to ask given the context and George\u2019s obvious left leaning. George did make progress on TWoW during Trump\u2019s first term, but mainly because he had nothing better to do during Covid. There\u2019s no Covid this time. I expect George will be stewing in political ire, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say this may affect his productivity. Give me your thoughts! How would Harris winning have changed the course of TWoW releasing, if at all?", "label": 1}
