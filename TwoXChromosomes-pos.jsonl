'be less angey' is not a discussion, and for reasons I outlined in a different comment I have serious doubts that that's how it went and there was no reason for him to say it.\n\nI in no way presented this as truth, I brought forward a scenario with roles reversed and supplied a different issues so as to not influence the current discussion. I can see how a single line could be interpreted as such, but that is not the intent. Everything else stands, especially when you include my response to OP calling it a straw man.\n\nThis scenario was created because OP provided no context.\n\nAnd I take serious issue with your 'pro tip'. 'calm down\" and 'anger is not conducive to solving this issue' are not the same thing and you fucking know it. And there's a huge difference between \"I'm angry about this thing that just happened \" vs. \"I've been seething about this for days/weeks/months/years\". That's not healthy and you *should* know that.\n\nIf the OP has been raging about these issues for months and it's having a negative effect on her or others, the husband was in the right to try and show her that. As her partner, theoretically he would be able to see these changes better than anyone else.\n\n I'm not saying he did a good job, because again, WE HAVE NO CONTEXT, but I seriously doubt that the husband of someone who appears to be a staunch women's rights supporter has 0 emotional intelligence and doesn't understand why she feels the way she feels.\n\nIt is MUCH more likely that he understood he would upset her by saying it, but believes that he should for x, y or z. \n\nYou, and apparently everyone else in this thread, are perfectly content with ignoring everything else that could have influenced this or how much harm anger over social issues actually causes to the psyche. Brains are plastic, they more you use a specific groove the easier it is to fall back into it\n\n I find it much more likely that the husband could see that happening and tried and failed to communicate that vs. he just offhandedly told her to calm her tits because he's tired of her asking for the right to vote or have an abortion.", "label": 1}

So we spent 6 months of hell where he went back to not being able to sleep at night. I kept asking the pediatrician to renew the prescription and that he wasn't sleeping. She kept telling me things like 'make sure he gets enough physical activity, limit screen time, try magnesium or melatonin, etc.' Things we had tried in the past and tried again during those six months.

I also think that we need to have more stringent laws for the father, too, so the mother is not bearing all of the pressure alone. I would also be for extending benefits for a child in the womb as well (redefining when the baby becomes a citizen). \n\nFor people who are pro-abortion, how do you get around the life argument?

{"text": "Why is no one here discussing the third option\u2014 adoption? Here\u2019s my two cents, for what it\u2019s worth:\n\n1) First, I want to preface this by saying I am vehemently pro-choice. The anti-choice brigade can go kick rocks. With that said, abortion is (barring freakish, rare complications) a final decision that can\u2019t be undone. \n\n2) Putting adoption on the table allows time for OP and her partner to actually sit down, have adult discussions, consider their finances, and if they can make adjustments in their lifestyle over the course of the pregnancy that will allow them to support the new baby in addition to their toddler. If OP leaves her partner (see my next point on *that* topic) it likewise allows her time to consider if she can raise two children as a single parent. If, at the end of the pregnancy, she realizes bringing the child into her home (with or without her partner) isn\u2019t feasible, then adoption is there as an option that OP could consider as in the best interest of the child. Going for an open adoption where she is still in the child\u2019s life may also be an option. \n\n3) OP, your fianc\u00e9 is a piece of work. Do you use condoms to prevent pregnancy? Leaving aside other forms of contraception, that is the ONE thing that the guy has control over (subject to the minute failure rate). If he didn\u2019t wear a condom, ask him (and yourself) this: would we be in this situation if you had used a condom? Get him to see that he has a part to play in this predicament. Tell him that he doesn\u2019t get to forego a condom and then also threaten suicide when the inevitable consequences of that act happen. Say you do choose to get an abortion this time and you choose to stay with him. Will he continue to act irresponsibly and forego protection and then ask you to get an abortion any time you end up pregnant? Like I said before, I\u2019m pro-choice, but repeatedly using abortion as your form of birth control is awful. It\u2019s not good for your health, physically or emotionally. \n\n4) You both really need to sit down, probably with a neutral third party present, and have discussions about your relationship and family plans. His abusive behavior in threatening suicide if you don\u2019t terminate your pregnancy is repugnant and absolutely needs to be addressed. He needs therapy to address that behavior. It\u2019s not something you want to bring your 3YO up around. If you decide to continue your relationship, insist on therapy, for him and for you, especially if you decide to go forward with abortion. (This is probably another thing to consider in your decision-making\u2014 can you afford the cost of therapy if you follow his wishes?) Discuss family size and if/when you guys think would be the right time to expand. Then insist on contraception (it\u2019d be best if both of you use it) for the time period that you\u2019re not willing to have a baby. If you choose to get an abortion this time and stay with him, tell him FIRMLY this is his one \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card and that you will NOT be having another abortion to \u2018fix\u2019 an oopsie that he doesn\u2019t want. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "label": 1}

That was when household incomes for average workers started flatlining. The 70's and early 80's also had high inflation and low growth. It was called stagflation. Boundless opportunities, not quite. Also, the most prosperous time in the US is now. We have the highest real incomes ever, low unemployment and boundless opportunities for young people to get ahead due to a labor shortage that will last for the foreseeable future.\n\nI do acknowledge that it's harder now to buy a home because not enough affordable housing is being built. Also the cost of education and medical care are proportionally higher. So young people do have some struggles that Boomer had less of. But young Americans are the most educated generations ever.

I thought this forum is more about empowering women not makeing each other victims. Stop accepting things that make you feel uncomfortable. Stop accepting being a victim. Be proactive in the way you are treated.   If people dont know they make you feel uncomfortable how are they suppose to know to stop that behavior.

It was a situation where i feel she was safe and speaking up would be warranted.  I do actually believe that women should be heard at all times. Wether the creepyness was intentional or not.  I know the world is stacked agains women in a lot of ways.  I just think its not going to get any better unless women band together to deal with these issues.  As a man i know that things are stacked agains women. I dont want women to accept it. Women need each other.

So far ive been attacked with nonsence but nothing much informative.  I appreciate the civil conversation. I do try to hold myself and other men accountable for bad behavior.  I am the old guy that talks to much. I do however check the vibe before starting conversations. Most the time its apparent when someone just wants to be left alone.

She asked again for them and I said no, not until its time to go to the OR.  At this point people were still introducing themselves and it is disconcerting to have people you cannot see talk to you. A few minutes later, under the guise of checking my IV, she administered Versed.  I was looking to my left at the time while speaking with Malek, she was on my right. I asked what are you doing, she just replied Versed and grinned at me.  She and Malek were the only other people in the room at that time.  I was not combative nor overly anxious.  from records: Respiratory: Respirations are non-labored. Cardiovascular: Regular rate, Regular rhythm.  Neurologic: Alert, Oriented. Psychiatric: Cooperative, Appropriate mood & affect.\n\nThe anesthesiologist came in the room briefly and asked if I wanted a Tap block.  I said I dont know what that is, he replied its for pain.  I said ok.  He never explained to me what it was nor did he come and discuss anesthesia with me.. that was the only time I met him.  Tho he said in the records: counselled patient on the indication of TAP block and risks ie bleeding, infection, hematoma, local anesthetic toxicity 20cc of 0.375% Ropi injected into each side .\n\none sentence I dont understand tho.. do surgeons usually request tap blocks for patients?  Indication: postoperative analgesia, specifically requested for management of postoperative pain by surgeon.\n\nWhen I woke up in PACU, the pain was extreme. I started climbing the bed rail.. the nurse a few feet away said Where ya going honey.. all I could say was pain pain.. she said that she had just given me a dose and it would be a few minutes before she could give another.  The tap block never did anything for the uterine area pain.. instead it settled around my belly button.  its been 6 weeks since the surgery and about 3 inches north and south of belly button is still fully numb and about 5 inches to either side.  His resident did the block and I think she nicked my liver because there was a lot of swelling for weeks after the surgery..  especially whenever I would take a pain pill.  the liver would press on my ribs and while not painful.. it was definitely uncomfortable. \n\nhere is the rest of the excerpt from records about the tap block: Preparation and technique: procedure risks and benefits explained to patient, who agrees to proceed, positioned supine, sterile preparation of site with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate/70% isopropyl alcohol, technique (injection through needle, ULTRASOUND used to optimize block success. Local anatomic landmarks identified. Needle seen approaching target nerve(s). Local anesthetic observed surrounding it/them.), initial bolus ropivacaine 0.375 % 40 ml. Procedure tolerated: well. Complications: none; easy and well tolerated. Success: complete. counselled patient on the indication of TAP block and risks ie bleeding, infection, hematoma, local anesthetic toxicity 20cc of 0.375% Ropi injected into each side . \\~  There is a timestamp for this. 11:09am, I was put under anesthesia at 9:24.  So when he explained the risks and benefits.. I was just waking up from anesthesia after surgery....???", "label": 1}

You can be upset about all those things, without telling another woman that her suffering isn't as important, because she isn't being called a child molester. Also, so many women are fetishized. Just look at porn, you can get any flavor woman you want. Big titted Asian? Thousands of tags. Skinny white girl om scrubs? Done. Part of being a woman is that assholes will only look at you and see a sex object. And that really really sucks. \"What were you wearing when you got raped?\"  Is really the same as fetish, because clearly the woman wearing a skirt and walking home wanted to fuck, of she didn't, why was she wearing that? Anything a woman wears can and has been fetishized, despite the wearers intentions. I have definitely been told that I'm only wearing something or interested in a male hobby for the attention, which is really just a subtle way of being told I'm a fetish. \n\nYou get to be upset that people don't consider you a real woman. But Let's not forget that literally right now people are trying to strip away female rights in a way to dehumanize them, make them completely reliant on men, and don't even consider their lives more valuable than a dead fetus rotting in their womb. My grandma couldn't get a house or credit without a man, despite working her entire life and being the strength that held their family together when her husband died young. Family annihilators do so because they see their wives and children as extensions of themselves that they get to treat however they please. Right now, men are forcing their wives and daughters to vote the way they want, because they don't trust them to be smart enough to choose for themselves. \n\nSo maybe don't come here and act like your new found criticism is coming out of nowhere or is specific to you. Women as a whole have been dealing with it since the dawn of time. To an alarming amount of men we are barely considered human and aren't worth more than livestock. \n\nIt is new to you, just like painting your nails is new to you. And it's going to be painful to work through all of those feelings. But maybe don't argue with your allies that your criticism is worse. We've dealt with it since the womb. My grandma was disappointed I wasn't a boy. I was told as a child I was too fat for a 2 piece swimsuit. My hair wasn't thick enough, I had too much tummy, my nose was too big, my boobs too big, my hips too big, my interests not girly enough, my interests were too girly, I didn't eat enough, I ate too much, I don't wear makeup, I wear too much makeup, at the same time I was a prude and a slut. I'm a bad driver because I'm a woman, I'm bad at math because I'm a girl, and on and on and on.

{"text": "Misogyny. So much of what was written in your post is absolutely 100% something cis women experience on a regular basis. You are very very wrong about the cis woman experience. Here is the thing - you are just now stumbling through the forest like a fawn - all of this most cis women have known our whole lives. It's just now that you are being perceived as a woman that you are becoming aware of it. I have seen three of my MTF friends through transitions, and they all experienced this, and I spoke with all of them about how much of it seems wildly unfair, rude, and horrible... but... it's what you (we) get for being a woman. \n\n90% of your perceived value is your appearance and the effort you put into it - and no matter what you do, it's going to be WRONG. Period. Forever. You will be picked apart to no end for the rest of your life and there really isn't anything you can do about it. It will have a real, meaningful impact on your career, personal relationships, the money you make, and how you are treated. It's what people will remember about you and it's what they will care about. Some people might fling a \"because your trans\" in there as an added insult, but when you boil it all down, it's just misogyny. Do you think FTM trans men get treated this way?\n\nOn hormones - All of your emotions, no matter how legitimate, will be blamed on hormones. You will be taken less seriously. You will be told you are wrong. You will be told that you are being dramatic. You will be told that what you are feeling isn't real. You will be told that your pain is somehow an insult to someone else. You will be told that you are INFERIOR because of your hormones. People will use it as an excuse to deny you things they never would have before. Again, no matter what you do, someone will diminish you and tell you that you are wrong. You will be scolded for your hormones. We all are - even by women. Remember, misogyny is not just something men do women. Women do it too.  \n\n\\>On top of this all, I don't believe this stuff is as pervasive as cis people want to say it is.\u00a0\n\nYou're right. It's worse. You just don't have any idea because you have just barely scratched the surface. It's been done to us since we were little girls. Most of us have just had to learn how to live with it and we don't complain too often because when something is done to you your whole life, it becomes normal. You just got to experience an existence where it didn't happen to you since childhood, so it seems so unfair because it is. \n\nAnd female relationships? We are all individual people and can't be generalized. Every friend group is wildly different as far as what the level of openness is. I've been in groups where talking about your period or sex at all is taboo. I've seen some of my friends' assholes. There is not going to be a standard for female friend groups. You need to ask what people are comfortable with. You need to ask what people's boundaries are. You need to have conversations about this stuff, and if you don't like the vibe, find other friends. \n\nHere is who you REALLY need to talk to - FTM trans men. Ask them what their experience going from female to male are. Compare notes. I think you are going to find a very true but uncomfortable reality is that females are just treated.... worse.", "label": 1}

Trump may have backed off the messaging, but he started that mess and will go right back to it the moment the algorithm isn't in his favor.  It's just like people making economic arguments for him that simply do not match his stated policies or what he did in office - they just sub in whatever they wish he did, somehow.  I have family that voted for him, and not one thing they say they want does he actually support.  That poll that asked about policies without labeling them as Democrat or Republican was downright depressing, with so many Republicans preferring Democrat policies but not voting that way - people don't want to actually read what the policies are anymore.

You have issues you win on, but you've created the intersectionality monster of ideological purity. You need to actually elect your candidate in a primary process, you need to look at the demos you lose and provide something for them to hope for, and you need to adopt a loose alliance model like the Rs have, so you can have people come together on what they actually want from you, even if they have major issues with other parts of your platform.\n\n\nReproductive health care is a winning issue for Dems, many on the right aren't Bible thumping evangelicals anymore, religion has waned there as well. Many of us don't want to increase the birthrate in only the segment of population that can't seem to manage birth control much less raise intelligent successful kind children, not to mention the human suffering of women with unviable dangerouserous or profoudly disabled fetuses.\u00a0\nSome economic and tax policies could be successful by dems, tax burden needs shifted to the top 1%, much more, and the middle and lower need relief. Child care cost reduction, improving educational results, and Dems getting back to any form of protectionism to help the working/middle class all could be winners.\n\n\nCrying about how everyone's dad and grandpa is a dirty nazi and acting like your going to\u00a0 be sent to a camp for zyklon B showers if your party doesnt win is not a winning strategy. The constant cycle of deny an issue is happening, then downplay said issue, then admit the issue is happening but that's a good thing!* is not a winning play.\u00a0\n\n\nYou guys want to be the party of equality and inclusion then you gotta care about EVERYONE, even the males and the straights and the whites. Otherwise you alienate those people and leave them the options of R, no vote/independent, or vote for you for social good boy points but actually get nothing for your demographic.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd the attitudes holy shit. You can't post a contrary opinion here without being censored by mods or getting down vote brigaded and a stream of shitty often personal attacks in response to opinions.\u00a0\n\n\nYou all have value and good ideas to add to the pile. We have to get past D and R and come together to discuss and hash out ideas as a people. Putting up walls and shitting on each other just leads to ugliness and poorer political outcomes for all of us. Otherwise the ultra wealthy continue to divide and conquer the rest of the 99.9% of people.

{"text": "Ok you are going too far back. I specifically chosen the timeframe that I wanted to discuss as racism that was previously huge problem was getting addressed through the efforts of generations and around year 2000 it was at its lowest. People got along with each other finally.\n\nAnd then identity politics came and erased all the work society done in 30 years before. Racism is at all time high and is only being incited more and more by the woke squad. \n\nIn terms of misoginy it is the same pattern. Problem was recognised, people were being educated about it, feminism movement was making huge progress and then it backfired again. You are 63 and I bet you remember that feminism in the past was much different to what it is now. Equality was achieved but it was not enough,feminists wanted more and so feminists are now as sexists as men used to be when it all started. It is hate club. No wonder that genders are falling apart yet again. \n\nAs for majority argument you are projecting a bit too much. Average people would want to share wealth, would want to help those in need. But you cannot take money away from them by force and give it to other group and expect they will be happy about it. When there are no houses and government is giving them away to refugees who illegally entered the country, people will fight back. Even if they are sympathetic to those refugees they will fight back. You can give when you have enough for yourself, not when you are struggling. \n\nIt is very simple concept that democrats fail to understand. Citizens and their problems are always first priority. Good government simply needs to check what most of society wants and follow it through. You can educate people in the matters they might be wrong to change their mind and then do what needs to be done. It is this step that democrats failed to implement, they have never convinced society about their agenda and instead enforced it and silenced and ignored any pushback. That may work short time but come elections and you have a big problem.\n\nYour argument may contribute a bit too, I allow such possibility. But its definitely not half a country being racists and misogynists. This is just wrong.", "label": 1}
