I don\u2019t know if people never knew or just forgot, but the home button's `escape`-like behavior in some situations was so great.

You'll run into the issue of having it properly activate though. Not sure if you can check for the existence of a specific app's notification and choose a workflow based off that\n\nif I remember correctly, you might have a bigger issue with this method, which is that the home button (even emulated through Activator) doesn't function the way it does on home button phones. I think I tried to use it to dismiss banners before, but it acts like a swipe up rather than a home button. I could be wrong though.\n\nYou could also try PowerCuts combined with Activator. PowerCuts should be able to check if the notification exists and close it along with the volume down (whole shortcut activated through vol down in Activator) . Issue there would be the running of a shortcut every time, so there would probably be some noticeable lag on your vol down events. It would accomplish this though.
