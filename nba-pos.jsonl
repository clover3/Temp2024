I don't have one book in my library that I'd say is a must read for everyone and neither does anyone else alive.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what's a few amazing books out there for you? And, to poke a bit.. Have you actually read it? And if so, where did it fall short in your opinion?\n\nTo show i mean it to have a discussion, I'll list 3 books (or series) that many think are amazing and one of them is another one that had a much bigger impact on me than many pedestalized works, recent or not:\n\n* Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens, Homo Deus and 21 lessons \"trilogy\" wasn't all that much new for me as I've been interested and read apparently enough about \"the time line\"\n\n* Thinking Fast and Slow from Kahneman is a great introduction to what is now a volatile field of economics connected to human behavior. Back then it seemed revolutionary, now? I don't think I'd recommend it outside of someone wanting to go into that specific field of academia, we keep learning about things at such an increased pace and it is an anchor to a field but hardly the seminal one anymore.\n\n* Survivor by Palahniuk is a fairly simple, fun, weird and straightforward story but having read that around web 2.0's explosion as a young person, it had more impact on me than the two above (later) and a ton of other highly regarded works throughout the millenia.", "label": 1}
