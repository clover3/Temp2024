I mirror traded with a side account as that gives you candy for the trade as well as the transfer, and transfering during a two times candy spotlight hour gives you more as well. You can also trade for distance Pok\u00e9mon, like from 7km eggs, then you get four candy for each trade. The pokecoin bounty ticket thing that allows you to open more gifts makes it go quicker.

So I now know my Mud Slapper has a great matchup in the back, and I can play shields accordingly to try and trap it later. \n\n(Morpeko-Azu-Altaria also isn\u2019t really an ABA team, they don\u2019t share a type at all?)", "label": 1}
