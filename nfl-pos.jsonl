And the assignment wasn't to full-on block Reddick, it was to chip him. And it actually worked. Reddick was out of the play long enough for the QB to get rid of it, but Purdy - by his own admission - held onto it too long.\n\nSo it in fact....did not work. Got it. What do you think Purdy is going to do in that situation? \"Ah yeah, well, the protection sucked so I kinda got blown up\". \n\n>And no, what he did was put his hands on an opposing player.\n\nSo after Greenlaw suplexed a player out of bounds ( a penalty btw), and was standing on the sidelines jawing at Eagles players, a staff member inserted himself inbetween them. In response the undisciplined player (while on the Eagles sideline) proceeded to jab his hand towards the staff member. \n\nThanks for clearing that up, my guy.  \n\n\n>And the assignment wasn't to full-on block Reddick, it was to chip him. And it actually worked. \n\nMy guy, this is a straight up block. He's not chipping in this. A chip block would indicate (shocking) chipping a player and continuing on a route. He is full on blocking. He in fact continues to try to block as Reddick rushes past him.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcZgvUzIc7w\n\nlmao, bro just take your witty one liner W and bounce.", "label": 1}
