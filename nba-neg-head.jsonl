From purely a \"how can we maximize our chance of winning more games,\" this was likely a smarter decision.\n\nThat being said, there's simply no way that the locker room dynamics would allow for this.  You get Harden, you play him.  That's basically what you'll abide by, just like you give Russ a shot at starting with your stars.\n\nAll that being said: what gets forgotten in a lot of this is that Plumlee getting injured made us insanely small, and we waited for Theis to reach a buyout before making any moves. I'm not sure anything was fixable, but LAC's approach to last season was always going to fail because the roster composition was janky and it was 1000% reliant on Kawhi being healthy.

The 2nd apron rules make it extremely difficult to keep a championship core together.\n\nThey had to pay Jamal, MPJ, and AG to keep the core intact, which didn't leave enough money for a competent 5th starter - they had to let both KCP and BB walk or they would've been over the 2nd apron. Once you're over that threshold it's not just expensive but handicaps your teambuilding - no more sign & trades, no more multi-player trades, can't include cash in trades, no signing players who were bought out. It's crazy prohibitive.\n\nThe only alternative was letting either MPJ or Jamal walk, but Denver's a small market and there's not a lot of chance of attracting stars to replace them.\n\nThe T-wolves made the conference finals last season and still traded KAT to dump salary and stay under the 2nd apron. The C's are over the apron and will need to dump salary next season; they won't be able to keep Tatum-Brown-Porzingis-Holiday together long-term.

Was not a fan of everyone standing around on the perimeter while Jokic gets triple teamed in the post.\n\nFor Russ it's pretty simple, when Jokic is out, you play shooters around him and let him grab and go to push pace, defense collapses, pass to open shooter. They did this a couple of times and Russ found Murray for a wide open 3.\n\nBut the most common line up with Russ and without Jokic was Russ, Murray, Strawther, Watson and Saric. Porter wasn't in any of the line ups with Russ and no Jokic. They should be trying Russ, Murray, Strawther, Porter, Gordon. Defense isn't great but that's their best shot in theory. Also no Murray dribbling isos in that line up (happened a few times).\n\nWith Jokic and Russ, I'd want to see a lot of DHOs between Jokic and Russ to get Russ putting pressure on the rim. And you can also fake the hand off and the defense will still guard Russ going to the basket. It just creates movement which is something that was very lacking in the game against the Thunder.\n\nI think they should also put Russ in the dunker spot like the Celtics and OKC do with their guards.

That's a better roster than what they have right now and there was a reason they went like 10-1 together. \n\nI dont think Bridges and KAT bring enough diversity to the offense considering there's even less passing/playmaking on the roster now.
