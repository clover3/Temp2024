If it wasn't possible to perform consistently in spite of high pressure at all, why do many top athletes, soldiers, etc. keep doing it? \n\n> It's not some certain guarantee that just because they have exposure previously that they will 100% be able to remain emotionally stoic for the rest of their career.\n\nNobody said that, you're building a fun strawman for yourself there.

One would expect from a seasoned competitor to realize the game was entirely in their hands and if it wasn't for that one mistake, they'd have won. If they got stomped throughout the entire game in a hopeless fashion like TES was, it would be more understandable, but they had complete control over their fate in Game 1 and then won game 2 resoundingly. If Game 1 still affects you at that point going into Game 3, that's a terrible performance.\n\nAnd Canyon and Kiin have never played for GENG at worlds before.\n\n> \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13 you reek of being both terminally online and insecure\n\nThis is basic stuff you hear from anyone who does competitive sports or anything where money is on the line in high pressure situations.

{"text": "People aren't being gleeful about him losing because they hate him as a player and like seeing him lose.  The glee is coming because of how utterly obnoxious his stan base has been, to an unhinged degree.  Calling him the next goat, hyping him up as the best in the world bar none for several years, and always blaming his team when he fails to win worlds.  *You people asked for this*.\n\nYou should be more than familiar with this sentiment.  You have enough history of talking down to T1 fans and claiming not to hate T1, but that you hate their rabid fanbase specifically.  Are you perhaps beginning to understand a little bit of how irritating that platitude is now?  Does it feel a bit irksome when suddenly you're the one who is part of the rabid fanbase whose player is receiving criticism?\n\n> So few people say that compared to the massive amount of people who shit on Chovy. The proportions are not even close to comparable.\n\nThis is such an egregious lie that I would think you were trolling if I didn't already know that you're a hardcore Chovy stan and T1 anti.  This has been Faker's worst year in recent memory and there has been no end of people calling him washed and saying he should retire.  Meanwhile you and the rest of the GenG stanbase has spent the entire year jerking each other off about how amazing your team (well, player in this case) is and aggressively squashing anyone who disagrees with your vaunted analysis.  Just a totally dishonest remark from you.\n\n> I think some introspection is in order for you.\n\nThis irony is *palpable*.  You've spent so long sitting pretty on your pretend throne of maturity lauding over how Chovy is amazing and T1 isn't, while deflecting criticism away as you disliking T1's fans specifically.  Now the shoe is on the other foot and you're trying to pretend like you're the victim here?  My comments aren't even defending T1.  I've spent a large portion of yesterday trying to defend Lehends from the likes of you, who would constantly trash him to protect Chovy from receiving any criticism at all.\n\nYou people seriously have no accountability, and no self-awareness.  You legitimately cannot recognise your own hypocrisy and when you are treated the way you treat others, you start kicking off.  This isn't just a clash of fandoms, and it is the height of arrogance to think that the only people who disagree with your opinion are doing so because of ideology and not reason.\n\nI don't care if you don't respect me, you long ago showed your true colours about pretending to a level of objectivity that you don't actually believe in.  It's very clear that your pretend objective analysis and faux intellectual theorising about this situation as an ideological clash makes you incapable of actually weighing in without bias.  This will always be a \"everyone hates Chovy because he challenged Faker\" situation for you.  Nothing anyone says or does will ever convince you that maybe, just maybe, there is some legitimacy to the criticisms levied at him.", "label": 1}

The bug report has been made by other players long before him, so he's not doing that. That's not the goal of his thread.\n\n>The idea would be to give a general area then.

That simple.\n\n>Didn't OP say that this bug has been there for quite some time now?

No. The priority for mobilization was people who'd completed military training prior to 2016. Meaning at youngest 25. A lot of the people fighting in Ukraine at the start of the invasion were the older population. Outside of volunteers ofc. \n\nWithout conscription the allies would have lost both the first and second world war. Your take here is perfect for peacetime.

Disregarding half the entire population as a whole because of average cases and then proceeding to conscript extreme edge cases seems very contradictive to me.\n\n2.
