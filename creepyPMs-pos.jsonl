{"text": "That went on for FAR too long. Should have blocked him after the first few messages. He\u2019s gonna try again you know, since he got you to engage this time. \n\nImmediate block next time! And if it persists, file harassment charges. Dude sounds unhinged.", "label": 1}
{"text": "So why did you keep talking to him for two pages then? Why not just block him after first no thankyou? Or better yet just block him and don't reply?
