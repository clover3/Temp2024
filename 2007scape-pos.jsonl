All I'll say is if you don't find value in something, you shouldn't be subject to make the transition when there are already viable alternatives in place. If you find value in jagex accounts, that's great, but dont purposely ignore the flaws that were addressed in this post about jagex accounts that remain to be addressed or fixed. I do not wish to transition to a jagex account on my main and would like to be able to bank without having to close the jagex interface every single time you bank. This was implemented a few days ago and was not something that was discussed with the player base beforehand. People who are opposed to the idea of Jagex accounts are also paying customers, and potentially losing even a small percentage of them over miniscule forceable interface changes seems nonsensical, especially considering they felt the necessity to recently raise rates and dont put much value into providing support for the authentic complaints. If jagex valued account security, constructive criticism, or providing support to their player base, they would have implemented a viable support team years ago. When Jagex makes changes and addresses people's trepidations about the product, or actually provides worthwhile incentives that would actually entice a maxed main account with already 100 empty bank slots that are readily available, I would be happy to switch. I have 2 alts on the same jagex account and despise switching between them on mobile as a result of the poor design flaw associated with said Jagex account and purposely opt to only play my main that is not on the Jagex Account. The fact that you mentioned filing a support ticket and actually believe that's a viable method to achieve a resolution for an issue on osrs means you have apparently never had to do so, lucky you.", "label": 1}
