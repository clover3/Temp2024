But let\u2019s keep it real: NASA is the one doing the real science, tackling the hardcore physics and logistics of actual space survival, while SpaceX is out here selling the dream.\n\nAnd speaking of lofty dreams, look at some of Elon\u2019s Earth-bound promises that fell a bit short. Remember the Cybertruck? It was hyped as a bulletproof, futuristic tank, and then\u2026 well, we all saw the glass shatter during testing. Or the fully self-driving Teslas that were supposed to be on the streets already, still TBD. It\u2019s a pattern\u2014grand promises that often end up bumping against pesky things like physics.\n\nNow, take that pattern and apply it to Mars. Elon talks big about a Mars colony, but who\u2019s studying the actual feasibility of humans surviving there? NASA. If Mars turns out to be unlivable, SpaceX isn\u2019t going to shoulder the cost of that learning curve. NASA\u2019s the one doing the groundwork, spending public funds on hard science to answer questions a private company wouldn\u2019t touch.\n\nSo yeah, SpaceX has the edge on efficiency, but when it comes to serious space exploration? NASA\u2019s the legend, taking on the risks and the physics that can\u2019t just be hacked. Bottom line: don\u2019t trust Elon to rewrite the laws of physics or rush the timeline.

Either admit you were wrong or stand by it.\n\nSwarm is/was an IoT constellation (i.e., low bandwidth, and no pizza-sized dishy required), so the tehcnology isn't even applicable to Starlink's primary purpose of broadband staellite internet. The most likely application to Starlink is in the direct-to-cell service--which is what Swarm's website now redirects to.\n\n>It was shit tho and faced a lot of controversy.\n\nThere were a lot fewer satellites then, so the service was poorer quality, and had limited and discontinuous coverage. That has been gradually solved by launching more, and larger (so higher bandwidth) satellites. That, let alone Starlink constroversies (astronomy, Ukraine, etc.), has nothing to do with the Swarm acquisition.\n\n>In fact, the whole launch was such a big failure, that they had to request new orbits in 2020. They launched 4400 satellites to an altitude of 1,100-1,300 km only to find out that they couldn't operate their systems, had broadband and security issues and were forced to halve their orbits to 540-570km. \n\nUtter bullshit. And Starlinks were *never* launched to 1100-1300 km altitude orbits. There were not \"security issues\" either. The grain of truth is that SpaceX at one time *planned* and received an FCC license to have 1/3 of their Starlink satellites ([4400 out of a 12,000 satellite constelltion](https://spacenews.com/spacex-seeks-fcc-permission-for-operating-all-first-gen-starlink-in-lower-orbit/)) at ~1200 km. But from 2019-2020, SpaceX requested and received FCC permission to transfer that license to the ~500-600 km altitudes used by the rest of their constellation. This is about lowering latency, and reducing the risk from and orbital lifetime of failed satellites--physical issues unrelated to any alleged changes in technology on the satellites. This was done *before* the Swarm acquisition in 2021, and Starlink has not been changed back to use 1200 km orbits post-acquisition.

For example, they were pulled out of the capsule, through normal spot check medical evaluations - and as is typical after long stays in space, one or more of the crewmembers was showing off-nominal vitals but nothing notable enough to think that anything unusual was going on. They did the conference, shared the information that everyone was doing great (which is accurate when you're talking about things in the context above). \n\nAs is normal, all were transported to the hospital for thorough evaluation, and one of them was found to have a new issue, or additional issues related to something they found in the spot check which is normally not an issue, but was enough for them to hold one of the astronauts for evaluation.\n\nSo again, this is all speculation but just one of quite a few scenarios in which \"The crew is doing great\" at the time of the conference would be accurate, while the contents of this article are also accurate.

{"text": "> lower latency\n\nAt LEO, satellite can compete with some fiber latency. As you start using higher orbits, latency starts to really suck though. \n\n> with enough satellites, it\u2019s possible to compete on bandwidth\n\nWith smart network management \u2014 caching on the LEO satellites, handoffs of streaming from LEOs to higher-orbiting satellites (for latency's sake, they can go back to an LEO orbit satellite when they switch to a new stream or jump around in theirs), you can add bandwidth from a much greater range of orbits. I don't know if anyone has run the math on that, it's not what anyone is talking about building right now.\n\nThis is relevant, because there are already some major known issues/questions (dark skies, particulates in upper atmosphere), from the scale of just Starlink's ambitions much less Bezos', China's, India's, the EU and Russia will want their own, etc.\n\nReminds of Jessy Kate Schingler's [epic talk on the commons in space](https://www.ted.com/talks/jessy_kate_schingler_civilization_on_the_moon_and_what_it_means_for_life_on_earth).\n\nFiber will continue to be a preferred option \u2014 where it is available \u2014 for a long time over satellite, maybe forever. And so the pressure to keep building it out *now* will continue, it just drops off at some point in population density enough that it doesn't get built out. Whenever someone with a big budget has a non-population reason, such as a cluster of sensors generating terabytes of information a day, they have reason lay a fiber line to a new place and a bunch of new communities will be closer to that fiber line and might extend it over to them. (It would help if jurisdictional issues were bridged more often to make this possible.)\n\nIt's not like hard drives vs. solid state drives (although even there, hard drives are about to start growing again, finally!). Fiber tech is mature but still has plenty of headroom to improve just from figuring out how to use each existing fiber better, last I checked. That includes faster chips at the ends of each fiber improving the capacity of the fiber.", "label": 0}

In order to then get to the tower, the Starship will need to do a cross-range-belly-flop, steering itself around the southern edge of Matamoros/Brownsville, before being caught.\n\nI've mapped out this trajectory here:  https://long-haired-git.github.io/\n\nIt's a working map - so you can zoom in on the last part of the red line for the landing, or look at the first part of the launch for the trajectory I propose.\n\nIt is a 31 degree inclination with a period of 94.2 minutes, and a landing on the third lap of the planet.  You'll notice it doesn't overfly reasonable populations during re-entry....\n\nWhat I'd love to see from IFT5 is:\n\n* Launch at dusk, so that the landing in the Indian Ocean is at dawn, and thus can be tracked by a flotilla of camera buoys and perhaps even drones.\n* De-orbit burn because I think this indeed is critical to prove works.\n* Hockey-Stick trajectory/cross-range-maneuver during the belly-flop (or even starting earlier) to practice skirting around a big population centre.\n\nHopefully we won't have to wait long to find out.", "label": 0}

But given the rate that SpaceX is producing Starships, they might even be able to achieve Artemis\u2019 mission goals without re-use (or only re-using the booster, like on Falcon)", "label": 0}

{"text": "The current OLM has the [20 Quick Disconnects](https://x.com/RyanHansenSpace/status/1783888781034021284) on the inner side of the ring, they use them to provide the start-up (I believe helium) for each of the outer 20 engines directly, saving mass on the booster. They retract along with the launch clamps at launch, and is why those engines can't relight in flight. For the old OLM, those + their associated plumbing inside the mount actually takes up a lot of room and adds complexity as a whole. With the new OLM, it's looking like those are gone (no room for them inside), and they may start all Raptors from the single Booster QD which also loads propellants (it is speculated they already do this for the remaining 13 engines). This is also partly why it's speculated that V2 boosters aren't coming until the new pad is online, the interfaces might be incompatible with the current pad. But the trade off would be the OLM is much simpler, I think post-Flight 5 was the first time they didn't have to replace parts of the 20 QDs.\n\n>Do you mean the bidet water jets will emerge from the raised region where the two ramps meet in the middle\n\nBy top deck bidet, I mean the [very top surface of the new OLM](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZeHXxXaAAAaezJ?format=jpg&name=large), so it would work like the current steel plate, with holes on the top to spray water out. The OLM gets torched by the 33 engines at lift-off, so they want to protect that surface a bit better than currently, since eventually you have to replace the eroded steel plates.\n\nThat bit where the ramps meet does look like a weak spot, though I haven't seen many ideas around that yet. Maybe the water will come out the top of each of those channels and form a \"blanket\" of high pressure water, maybe such a piece would itself have water flowing in it and spraying out. Assuming it'll end up looking like that, of course.\n\n>Presumably they will wait to do this after booster catches are routine (so no need for back-up OLM) but before the launch frequency really picks up\n\nProbably yeah. I feel like the sooner the better. Launch cadence will pick up, but I don't really see it getting that high next year that they need two pads, provided this new OLM+trench can reduce turnaround time significantly. I mean having two might be convenient, but not a must. So as soon as the new pad is operational sounds good.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The breakthrough came last month, about 600 miles above Earth.\n\nFor the first time, the Pentagon\u2019s Space Development Agency used lasers to more securely transmit data at light speed between military satellites, making it easier to track enemy missiles and if necessary shoot them down.\n\nIt was a milestone not only for the Pentagon. This was a defining moment for a certain up-and-coming military contractor that had built key parts of this new system: Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX over the last year started to move in a big way into the business of building military and spy satellites, an industry that has long been dominated by major contractors like Raytheon and Northrop Grumman as well as smaller players like York Space Systems.\n\nThis shift comes as the Pentagon and U.S. spy agencies are preparing to spend billions of dollars to build a series of new constellations of low-earth-orbit satellites, much of it in response to recent moves by China to build its own space-based military systems.\n\nSpaceX is poised to capitalize on that, generating a new wave of questions inside the federal government about the company\u2019s growing dominance as a military space contractor and Mr. Musk\u2019s extensive business operations in China and his relations with foreign government leaders, possibly including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nMr. Musk is also unpredictable in a sector in which security is often perceived to be synonymous with predictability. He chafes at many of the processes and rules of government, saying they hold back progress, and wants to make his own calls.\n\nElon Musk is unpredictable in a sector in which security is perceived as synonymous with predictability.\n\u201cThe complication is that you\u2019re incredibly dependent on a company that is privately held, meaning we have very little visibility into their finances,\u201d Todd Harrison, a former space industry executive who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said. \u201cAnd it is controlled by the richest man in the world, who has gotten heavily involved in the politics and heavily involved with some foreign leaders who are adversaries of the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s company has already proven itself a category killer of sorts in two other chunks of the rapidly growing commercial space industry: satellite launches, through its Falcon 9 rocket family; and communications, through its Starlink system, which has more than 6,400 satellites in space and already communicates using lasers. This latest move involves selling the federal government what are called satellite buses, the satellite bodies without their internal components.\n\nThis new line of business brings Mr. Musk\u2019s company into an even more sensitive area of military operations, as SpaceX-built equipment is now integrated directly into spy agencies and military networks that defend the United States against missile attacks and allow the military to monitor enemy forces and equipment on the ground.\n\nThe Space Development Agency contract, so far, is relatively small: $149 million for the four SpaceX satellites used to test the new system. But the agency has just started the competition for the next stage of the system.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do this with hundreds and hundreds of satellites,\u201d said Derek Tournear, director of the Space Development Agency, at a SatNews conference in California last week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get these new capabilities in the hands of the war fighter.\u201d\n\nBut this new military work comes as Mr. Musk has increasingly embraced and circulated conspiracy theories in the name of partisan politics \u2014 and is actively campaigning on behalf of former President Donald. J. Trump \u2014 in contrast to the military and spy sectors, which have traditionally leaned conservative but value decorum.\n\n\u201cElon Musk appears to be very self-interested and that is something that we have to really pay attention to and be worried about,\u201d said Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nMr. Musk and representatives from SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor the Defense Department, it is a matter of conflicting imperatives, several senior Pentagon officials said in interviews.\n\nAs China has moved rapidly in recent years to build up its presence in space, which will allow it to closely monitor the movement of U.S. warships and troops and potentially to disable American satellites, the Pentagon has intensified its effort to radically revamp its own such networks.\n\nSpaceX has proved itself to be a fast, reliable and relatively cheap supplier of many of the tools the military and spy agencies need, answering the call from the Defense Department to provide what it calls \u201cinnovation at the speed of threat.\u201d\n\nBut three Pentagon officials said there was growing concern that the federal government might be unintentionally subsidizing the creation of a vertically integrated monopoly \u2014 a business that controls the entire supply chain of an industry \u2014 making it increasingly difficult for other companies to enter this fast-growing market. The officials spoke with The New York Times on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the matter.\n\nFor example, the Pentagon committed funding to SpaceX as it was developing the next-generation satellite bus that it will use on its Starlink satellite system. These advanced satellite buses are being used by the National Reconnaissance Office to build its new spy satellite network, which had its fourth launch on a SpaceX rocket last week. That contract is worth $1.8 billion, as was first reported by Reuters.\n\nPut more simply, SpaceX is building hundreds of the satellites for the spy agency and then putting them into orbit on its own rocket.\n\nSpaceX competitors said that Mr. Musk deserves credit for the many innovations that have significantly cut the cost of getting to orbit, effectively creating a modern commercial space industry that the company now dominates.\n\n\u201cWe can all fling arrows at SpaceX for being the 800-pound gorilla,\u201d said Adam Spice, the chief financial officer of Rocket Lab, one of SpaceX\u2019s launch competitors, also speaking at the conference last week in California. \u201cBut they kind of earned their way into that, right, I mean through execution.\u201d", "label": 0}
{"text": "A series of recent moves by the Pentagon illustrates the reach SpaceX now has as a military contractor.\n\nA year ago, the Space Force, which oversees most of the Pentagon\u2019s efforts in orbit, opened bids using a new pathway for rocket launch companies to get a piece of its business. It was meant to encourage growth among smaller, emerging companies that might offer SpaceX some competition. Space Force said it would give out $5.6 billion in launch contracts through 2029.\n\nBut when Space Force this month disclosed the first batch of these task orders, all nine of them, worth $733.6 million, had gone to SpaceX. In explaining the choice, Space Force officials noted that it was the only company with a rocket ready to handle its payloads. They added that other companies including Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin could compete in future rounds.\n\n\nAll nine of Space Force\u2019s first new contracts, worth $733.6 million, went to SpaceX.\nWithin the last year, Space Force also agreed to buy up to $900 million worth of communications services over the coming decade from companies that have satellites in low-earth orbit, including SpaceX and 15 other vendors.\n\nOnce again, SpaceX was there to reap the rewards.\n\nWithin the first year of this deal, more than $500 million in spending commitments were made \u2014 much faster than expected \u2014 with the \u201cvast majority\u201d of that money going to SpaceX, Clare Hopper, chief of the Space Force\u2019s Commercial Satellite Communications Office, said in an interview.\n\nThe agency responded by increasing the cap on the contract value to $13 billion.\n\nThe new line of business is the satellite bus itself, which is the spacecraft that carries sensors and other equipment that do the surveillance or targeting work, providing power to this equipment and maneuvering the satellite to keep it at the right orbit. Other vendors typically manufacture the sensors that are placed inside the SpaceX satellites and sold to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX generally no longer owns these military satellites once they are deployed, and access to data they gather is tightly controlled by the government. But the company does at times play a role in the operation of the satellites themselves, Pentagon officials said.\n\nThe Defense Department recognizes the risks of relying too much on a single vendor.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of vendor lock, or dependence upon a sole vendor, has the potential to negate the strengths of the market by stifling innovation and inflating prices,\u201d a Defense Science Board report issued this year on the commercial space industry concluded. \u201cThis can culminate in a de facto monopoly, cementing a stagnant and wasteful anticompetitive paradigm.\u201d\n\nWhen SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets were briefly taken out of service on three occasions this year by the Federal Aviation Administration as a result of minor mishaps, it meant that during those periods the Pentagon had almost no way to get medium or large payloads to space. (Its other approved vendor, United Launch Alliance, was until recently still testing its own new rocket.)\n\n\u201cTo have a large launch family down, and kind of a pause on launches, it\u2019s definitely not a good feeling,\u201d said Richard Kniseley, the head of the Space Force\u2019s Commercial Space Office.\n\nMr. Tournear, director of the Space Development Agency, and Troy Meink, deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, both said this month that they see signs of growing strength and diversity in the commercial satellite marketplace.\n\nThe National Reconnaissance Office \u201cis working with a much broader set of industry partners than really any time in our history, large and small companies,\u201d Mr. Meink said.\n\nBut others said SpaceX now had such a large scale and role in so many key aspects of the space industry, it would often translate into a major advantage over other bidders.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a launch or a spacecraft competition that SpaceX can\u2019t walk into and completely warp and run the table,\u201d said Mandy Vaughn, chief executive at GXO, a space-industry consulting firm, and member of the Defense Science Board. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s operations around the world also raise concerns.\n\nPentagon officials said they most frequently engage with Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief operating officer, not Mr. Musk, and have been told by SpaceX employees that they attempt to wall off Mr. Musk from highly classified details of the military and spy agency contracts. (A Pentagon official declined to address if Mr. Musk has a security clearance.)\n\nBut the worries persist, including at NASA, which has awarded SpaceX $4.4 billion in contracts to use its new Starship rocket for two rides to land astronauts on the moon. This rocket, the largest ever built, will be used to launch even bigger satellites and also reduce the cost of fights to orbit, most likely giving SpaceX greater dominance in the market.\n\nBill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said late last week at a Semafor conference in Washington that the government should investigate whether Mr. Musk has had contact with Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cIf the story is true that there have been multiple conversations between Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then I think that would be concerning,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, \u201cparticularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.\u201d", "label": 0}

Everyone else (ULA) was buried in wallstreet buyouts, mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, and government profiteering that engineering skill went from a 10/10 in the US to probably a 2/10. Elon Musk brought it back to a 5/10 and that was enough to build SpaceX. Gwynne Shotwell is probably the person that took SpaceX from 5/10 to a 8/10 engineering company. \n\nAnd his engineering approaches have lead to failures (solarcity). So it's not like he found some secret sauce. \n\nHe has a couple of skills: he is decisive under crisis and he does have a good ability to understand engineering problems. But neither of those are unique to him and neither are things that make him good at managing a large organization. In fact, they probably make him bad at managing a large organization. Large organizations are about two things, purpose and people leadership. Elon was good at purpose (although that skill seems to have disappeared with his twitter addiction) and has always been terrible at people leadership (firing people on whims is always bad leadership). But SpaceX has Gwynne. Tesla does not. So we are seeing some major problems at Tesla (queue the robotaxi event which was not just bad, it was probably illegal). \n\nMy bottom line, for SpaceX to do well in the future, Elon Musk should probably be removed from direct leadership and put into more of an advisory role. Otherwise, Elon is likely to engineer a crisis at SpaceX. A crisis that SpaceX might not be able to recover from.", "label": 0}

Prop transfer in LEO - maneouvering to dock and stay docked, mitigating boiloff, tons and tons of prop transfer in microgravity, undock and depart. This requires three types of Starship: a depot, several tankers, and HLS. And of course, a fast-ish launch cadence for the Tankers with Booster reuse and maybe Tanker reuse. And lots and lots of props produced and delivered at the launch pads in a short-ish period of time.\n\n2. HLS travelling to an NRHO around the Moon and docking with the Gateway module/station - actually walking the walk, maneouvering to dock and stay docked with the Gateway, which is much smaller an lighter than HLS, boiloff mitigation in Lunar NRHO so HLS can stay there up to 100 days, all of the life support systems in HLS to receive astronauts, maneouvering to undock and depart NRHO towards the Moon.\n\n3. Moon landing - HLS landing gear and legs, finding a flat-ish spot to land, new engines/thrusters to safely land on the Moon (Raptors are too powerful and would send regolith flying all around at unacceptably high speeds, Super Dracos have been discarded), landing maneouver.\n\n4. Moon stay - HLS airlock and elevator for astronauts to safely step on Moon's surface and go back to their living quarters without spreading too much regolith around, boiloff mitigation so astronauts can stay at least a week on the Moon.\n\n5. Moon departure - safe reignition of new engines and liftoff, maneouvering to enter NRHO and dock and stay docked with the Gateway, allow the astronauts to leave HLS without spreading regolith all over the Gateway.\n\n6. Disposal - Maneouvering to undock from the Gateway, leave NRHO around the Moon, and travel to some heliocentric orbit or landing (not crashing) on the Moon again and stay there until it can be refueled or dismantled or return to Earth and be safely destroyed by the atmosphere - whathever the remaining prop allows.\n\nPublicly, we don't know how far ahead internal work has progressed to solve some or all of these challenges so they can quickly cross each bridge once they get there.", "label": 0}

Today I can walk into an airport hungover and fly anywhere in the world for very little, comparatively, and I don't even bother to notify my next of kin because I have no expectation of dying on the plane.\n\nI expect this to be like any other mode of transport: dangerous at first, statistically very safe later. I don't think it will ever be as safe as air travel but it might approach it. People will die, of course. But it will be worth it. Would I get on one of these things? Nah.

Any new mode of transport carries significant risks as it develops. How many people died traversing from the Old World to the Americas? How many people died on the journey to Australia? The Hindenberg fire was a major object lesson in not using hydrogen, but the fire itself didn't kill the airship \u2009\u2014\u2009 economical planes did. \n\nIn general, I don't think people underestimate how dangerous space is. Falcon 9 might have a failure rate of 1%, but the failure mode in that 1% is not catastrophic. Crew has never been lost.

{"text": "I think \"gross incompetence\" is a little strong.  But I agree that often times we vastly overstate peoples' expertise in particular realms in two ways:\n\n1) breadth - folks are hired in to FWS because they know a lot about fish and wildlife, which probably means biology or ecology backgrounds and an interest in wildlife.  But they won't know about rocketry, noise suppression systems, or even the impact of space operations in other venues like Canaveral.  They'll have to research that.  Like in everything else, the internet can give them a quick read.  We answer questions on this stuff all the time here.  Many people have questions, they will too.\n\n2) depth of knowledge - they're in an office, just like many of us, and have varying levels of experience and expertise.  They say it takes ten years to become expert in something.  If that something is \"FWS regulations,\" that expertise is built against a moving target as Congress and executive branch leadership/meddling changes those regulations.  They're trying to figure out the regulations just like us here in an interest community.  Sure, I'd rather they knew them cold.  But they probably don't.\n\nThat means they are figuring it out like the rest of us, and may get it wrong sometimes as initial guesses are put out for review and scrutiny.  Occam's Razor - don't assume malevolence when incompetence will do.\n\nBut also, they don't want their rulings to fail.  One way to do that is to make sure you've read a wide range of objections to account for them in your ruling.  If they weren't reading ESGHound I'd be more concerned, not less, because making a bad ruling is going to create 10x the delay the ruling itself creates.", "label": 0}

Thoughts?\n\n> **IFT-6** (B13/S31) official date not yet set, but launch expected before end of 2024; technical preparations continue rapidly. The [FAA license for IFT-5 also covers the IFT-6 mission profile](https://x.com/BCCarCounters/status/1845153328210018448) as IFT-6 changes are \"within the scope of what has been previously analyzed.\" [Internal SpaceX meeting audio](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1849914261482652113) indicates IFT-6 will focus on \"booster risk reduction\" rather than \"expanding Starship envelope,\" implying a similar scope to IFT-5 and prior. Additions to the approved IFT-6 scope that trigger FAA review are unlikely because SpaceX asserted the timeline will \"not be FAA driven.\"", "label": 0}
