{"text": "I would say maybe talk to this mother more directly about what you're worried about. I am a parent and also have dealt with CPS getting called on my family by one of my psychotic neighbors. I've also had CPS investigate my parents when I was in my late teens. Neither of which I believe were even remotely warranted and both instances really screwed up our lives for a good part of 6 months. I remember thinking how crazy and stupid it was when I was a teenager, it put a ton of added stress on our lives. My weird psycho aunt who lives across the country was the one who called on my parents when I was a teen. I was 17 and about to move out on my own. When we had a visit from them as an adult it was over the dumbest stuff. My kids were super afraid of them coming by and they worried they would take them away. I had no doubt that we did not deserve getting them called. The case was eventually dropped but it still had a horrible impact on everyone involved. I would say if your roommate is going through a divorce, you must realize this could basically upend her life. It could have some real drastic repercussions on the parent and the child. That would be a real shame if the kid has zero abuse and you accuse an innocent person of it. If the mother is in bed with the child and in-between the man and the child, then that should hopefully be enough. In the end, I absolutely despise the thought of people abusing a child so if the kid seems like she's abused, then I suppose it's better safe than sorry. Just understand the gravity of what you're accusing this person of is all I can really say. It's a very emotional and stressful process having random visits from an agent who may or may not be the right person to judge. Thankfully the CPS agent we had when I was an adult was very helpful and understood that some people report things with not much merit.  I hope it all works out for your roommate, her child and yourself.", "label": 1}

She was high and tried to later deny it and say he was climbing on the tv.

His brother was sexually abusing him on the daily. Verbal sister told what was happening and she got removed because a foster home was found for her. Lucky. Oh and these kids were adopted by the abusive parents even though there were multiple cps cases on the parents previous to the adoptions of these kids, they\u2019d been abusing their biological kids. Another example, parents who do visits while kid is in a foster placement and the parent abused the teen kid during the visit, all documented while investigation is taking place and 2 days later is placed back with abusing parent. Those all rose to the level of investigation, \u2026..eventually. And most were still not protected. Parents who refuse to cooperate with the court ordered family plan and still get the kids back.

If it helps you feel any better, my guess is your company did not offer paid maternity leave anyway given their response to your announcement. Federal law only guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave. I don't know what state you live in but only 13 states require private companies to offer paid maternity leave, which is only partial pay and ranges from 1 to 12 weeks depending on the state. \n\nWhile it sucks to lose your job so early in your pregnancy your job was not going to support you during or after. Start looking for something else. Look up laws in your state to find out if you have any state leave mandated and ask during the interview process about the benefits package (if maternity leave is included they will state that). Figure out what is being offered and what you can afford to take and then create a plan with your employer, ie I plan to work until delivery, I plan to start leave 1 week before my due date, I plan to take 6 weeks maternity leave, I plan to take 12 weeks maternity leave, etc.... have it figured out before you tell your next job you are pregnant.

The twist was that all the food she bought was stuff for her to eat, like tv dinners, several tubs of rocky road ice cream, grape crush drink packets and cartons of menthol cigarettes, knowing full well my wife was allergic to cigarette smoke. She demanded i hand over 1,200 to pay for the things she bought for herself, but that we had no choice but to eat. The only things we asked for were spaghetti pasta, sauce, and mild sausage to make actual food. We told her to get F'd cause the stuff she bought was her food and cigarettes, the internet was her idea, and the r3nt she claimed was not valid cause she owned the house and the two on either side of her, while living on a fixed income. so she called the cops to have us removed from the premise.

Many of them are probably parents themselves who might be concerned with the frequency or *intensity* of the tantrums.\n\nAs I commented elsewhere, I lived in a townhouse and had a similar situation with neighbors who had a toddler they'd leave screaming for hours on end in the middle of the night with the windows wide open. We'd also often hear tantrums when they'd leave to go places, and I think the sheer intensity of these tantrums and length they'd go on for seemingly unattended was concerning.\n\nEventually the neighbors called the cops and got into a fight with the dad over it. Not too long after, all the noise stopped. The people who called the cops ran a daycare center in their house (and you never would have known if it weren't for the cars coming in and out to grab their kids) so it goes to show that even people who love kids and tend to them for a living can get worried and call the cops.\n\nThat being said, I empathize with both OP and the neighbors because it's not easy as a parent, and it's not easy to deal with as a neighbor trying to sleep.", "label": 1}

{"text": "1. Document Everything\n\nEvery request you\u2019ve made, every time they\u2019ve refused\u2014it\u2019s time to get it all in writing. Start by emailing your landlord or sending a formal letter that lists each repair needed and politely reminds them that, per your lease, it\u2019s their responsibility. Include specific sections of the lease that outline their repair obligations. This not only serves as a polite nudge but also creates a paper trail if you need one down the line.\n\n2. Check Local Tenant Laws\n\nMany places have laws that mandate landlords to handle necessary repairs, especially for things that affect safety or livability (like that window lock). A quick look at your local tenant rights can confirm whether these issues legally fall under their responsibility, even beyond what\u2019s in the lease. This gives you extra leverage if they\u2019re dragging their feet.\n\n3. Propose a \u201cRepair and Deduct\u201d Option in Writing\n\nIt\u2019s smart that you didn\u2019t jump right into deducting from rent\u2014while that\u2019s tempting, it can be legally sticky if your lease doesn\u2019t allow it. Instead, email your landlord (again, in writing) with a request to repair and deduct. Mention that, since they\u2019ve refused to handle these issues despite your lease terms, you\u2019re willing to have the repairs done and deduct the costs from next month\u2019s rent if they agree in writing. This could nudge them into taking action to avoid paying for repairs later.\n\n4. Consider a Repair Escrow\n\nIf they continue to refuse, check if your area allows tenants to pay rent into an escrow account when landlords fail to make essential repairs. This way, you\u2019re not withholding rent entirely\u2014you\u2019re just setting it aside until they handle their responsibilities. This can often get landlords moving, since they don\u2019t want to miss out on rent payments.\n\n5. Be Prepared to Escalate if Needed\n\nIf your landlord still won\u2019t budge, you can file a complaint with your local housing authority or seek help from a tenant advocacy group. Sometimes, just mentioning you\u2019re prepared to file a complaint can work wonders for a landlord\u2019s attitude.\n\nRemember, you\u2019re well within your rights to expect what\u2019s in your lease\u2014don\u2019t let them convince you that \u201cbasic maintenance\u201d covers their negligence.

Take photos of injured animals, vet reports, and if you have a way to record the dogs on your property, do that. The more documentation, the stronger your case will be.\n\nStep 2: Talk to Animal Control\n\nContact Louisa County Animal Control ASAP. They can enforce regulations that prevent hunting dogs from trespassing and harming animals on private property. Explain the issue and provide all your evidence. They might be able to identify the owner and issue warnings or fines.\n\nStep 3: Fencing and \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d Signs\n\nIf possible, reinforce any fencing or boundaries around the property to help deter dogs from coming in. Also, post \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d or \u201cKeep Out\u201d signs, especially if you have any designated areas near the barn or outbuildings.\n\nStep 4: Defending Your Property\n\nIn Virginia, you generally have the right to protect your property, but force is tricky. If you\u2019re dealing with a threatening animal on your property that\u2019s actively causing harm, you may be justified in using reasonable force to defend your animals. \u201cReasonable force\u201d can vary\u2014it\u2019s best to avoid lethal measures unless it\u2019s an absolute last resort, as this could lead to legal challenges, especially if the dogs are considered hunting or working animals.\n\nStep 5: Civil Claim for Damages\n\nYou may also have grounds to file a civil claim against the dog\u2019s owner for the damage caused to your property (your cats are considered property under the law). If you can determine who owns these dogs, you could potentially seek compensation for vet bills and other damages.", "label": 1}

A parent who\u2019s been absent for nearly a decade, never met his child, didn\u2019t sign the birth certificate, and lives out of state starts with strikes against him.\n\nNow, about that claim that he \u201cnever knew\u201d about his child?

{"text": "First, because you\u2019ve been living there for three years, paying rent directly, and they haven\u2019t had you sign a lease, you\u2019re considered a month-to-month tenant under California law. In California, if they want you out, they can\u2019t just give you a verbal \u201cheads-up\u201d; they\u2019re required to give written notice to terminate your tenancy. As a month-to-month tenant who\u2019s been there longer than a year, you\u2019re entitled to at least 60 days\u2019 written notice to vacate. No written notice, no clock ticking.\n\nAnd if they refuse to give you anything in writing? You can politely ignore their timeline. They\u2019re legally stuck until they follow the proper procedure.\n\nNow, if they finally get around to putting something in writing and you still haven\u2019t found a new place by then, here\u2019s what could happen:\n\n1. If you don\u2019t leave after the 60 days\u2019 written notice, they\u2019d have to go through the formal eviction process in court to remove you. This takes time, and if they try to lock you out or cut off utilities, that\u2019s considered an illegal \u201cself-help\u201d eviction, which could land them in trouble with the law.\n\n2.

You\u2019re facing both a medical mishap and an academic nightmare, so let\u2019s break it down.\n\nStep 1: Getting to the Bottom of the Medical Side\n\nYou\u2019ve been led down a questionable road by both your surgeon and physical therapist, which may have caused you harm. You trusted the \u201csimple, quick recovery\u201d advice, only to find yourself with a recovery plan that was flat-out wrong. Here\u2019s what you should do next:\n\n1.\tDocument Everything: Gather every single medical record, including the surgeon\u2019s notes, physical therapy records, and any other documents related to your treatment. Write down every detail you can remember about what the surgeon and physical therapist told you. Your sister-in-law\u2019s testimony as a doctor who reviewed your situation may also help.\n\t\n2.\tFile a Complaint with the Medical Board: Texas has a state medical board that investigates claims of malpractice and misconduct. A doctor misleading a patient about the severity and recovery time of a surgery could very well constitute negligence, and the board can take disciplinary action if they find fault. This won\u2019t necessarily lead to compensation, but it could help establish that you weren\u2019t given proper care.\n\t\n3.\tConsider Consulting a Medical Malpractice Attorney: You may have a malpractice claim if you can prove that (1) the surgeon misrepresented the surgery to you and (2) the physical therapist\u2019s actions harmed you. A good malpractice attorney can review your case and determine if you have grounds for a lawsuit. Since you\u2019re new to legal action, find a lawyer who offers a free consultation, so you can weigh your options without cost or commitment.\n\nStep 2: Holding Your College Accountable\n\nYour college\u2019s handling of this situation reeks of inflexibility and, frankly, a lack of care for students with legitimate health issues. They are offering you two terrible options: drop out and owe money or continue in a way that could damage your academic record. Here\u2019s how you fight back:\n\n1.\tPush for Reasonable Accommodation Under ADA: Colleges are required to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities or medical conditions under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Your injury and surgery recovery certainly qualify as a temporary disability. Not all colleges are as proactive as they should be with ADA accommodations, but once you invoke the law, they\u2019re legally obligated to respond. Contact the college\u2019s disability services department and formally request accommodations for remote learning and extensions due to your recovery.\n\t\n2.\tEscalate to the Dean or Administration: Since you\u2019ve been hitting roadblocks with departments and professors, go higher up. Submit a written complaint explaining your situation in detail, emphasizing that you are not asking for special treatment but for necessary accommodations to continue your education. Include copies of your medical documentation. When they realize you\u2019re serious about ADA protections, they may become more cooperative.\n\t\n3.\tConsult an Education Lawyer: If the college continues to dig its heels in, consider reaching out to an attorney who specializes in educational law. Colleges are bound by federal laws to support students in your situation, and an education lawyer can often help apply the right pressure.\n\nNavigating this maze might feel overwhelming, but taking it step-by-step, as we outlined here, can help you take back some control. You\u2019re strong, and your health and education are worth fighting for.", "label": 1}

I can take it on face value that you were written up for reasons that weren\u2019t your fault, but your coworker also being written up doesn\u2019t make for much of an illustration as to why.

There seems to be key omitted information here.\n\nI will clarify, but note that this is not the basis of reason of my claim; I only included this part so that people on Reddit didn't say \"Shouldn't have gotten written up!\"\n\nThe reason I was written up, along with my coworker, were that we got a new supervisor who micromanages and threatens that we will get in trouble because a customer told the representative xyz when cancelling, which caused us to be obsessively cautious and not meet quota (it's usually that the customer said they never placed the order, but every representative gets these claims during audits because EVERY department is a sales department, including the cancellation department, and the only damned way to cancel service is to say \"I never ordered it\". The supervisor has said \"When I call these customers they always have a totally different story to tell and they always say you were great and did nothing wrong but canceled because they changed their mind, or the service was bad, etc.\" yet he was calling me multiple times per week to say something came up and make me think I'd get fired). Additionally, the company is no longer competitive whatsoever and EVERYONE is struggling except for people who seem to lie. The coworker and myself were both top sellers who frequently hit 3x quota.\n\nMy basis for my claim is that I was given false information about what happens when you're in corrective action, and to what point I was funded. \n\n\\> Are you being reprimanded for being combative?

{"text": "I'm sorry to hear you\u2019re going through this. Here are steps you can take, including relevant U.S. laws that may apply to this unauthorized enrollment:\n\n1. **File a Complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**: Since this involves unauthorized enrollment and deceptive practices, you should file a complaint with the FTC. This agency enforces the **Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR Part 310)**, which prohibits deceptive telemarketing practices. The rule protects consumers from unauthorized charges, and this situation may violate the rule since you explicitly stated you weren\u2019t interested and did not consent to enrollment.\n\n2. **State Insurance Commissioner**: Each state has a Department of Insurance or an Insurance Commissioner who regulates health insurance companies. Contacting them can help escalate the issue. They can investigate unauthorized enrollment or billing practices. This could prompt an investigation into United Health Care's practices regarding deceptive enrollments.\n\n3. **Right to Cancel Under Federal Law**: Under the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** and **Medicare and Medicaid services regulations**, consumers generally have rights to cancel health insurance within a specific timeframe if it was unauthorized. You may be able to argue that your enrollment should be canceled immediately without penalty, as it was made without your consent.\n\n4. **Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA)**: Since this involved a bank transaction, you may be able to dispute the charges under the FCBA. If your bank initially reversed the charge but United Health Care has responded with threats to charge you again, report this to your bank as unauthorized.\n\n5. **Consider Reporting to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**: If United Health Care attempts to collect additional payments or issues a penalty, this could fall under unfair debt collection practices, which are regulated by the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)**. This would be relevant if they use aggressive tactics to collect payments.\n\n6. **Document Everything**: Keep all emails, voicemails, and records of calls where you stated you were not interested in enrolling. Documentation could support a claim of unauthorized enrollment if you escalate this legally.\n\nTaking these steps should help get attention on the unauthorized enrollment and potentially lead to cancellation without additional charges.

For instance, if you are on trial for DUI first, yet had a DUI twelve years ago that is ruled inadmissible, if you do something that allows conviction of a DUI twelve years ago into evidence, that is going to be very very bad. If the person accused of DUI testifies they never drank and drove or have never got behind wheel and drive drunk before, the previously ruled inadmissible 12 year old dui may become admissible.

There are cases where the parent gets found in contempt, lose custodial rights, and the children get treated as delinquents. \n\nEventually, you want to get to the point where you can prove to the judge that even though you may not like the custody order, you respect the judge's authority.

That\u2019s not to say they couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t, but it seems pretty unlikely.  \n\nI think the hotel is morally wrong and probably legally right.  If having a particular form of ID is their policy, and they make this information available in advance of your booking, then it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you actually saw it; by booking the room, you entered into the contract and couldn\u2019t fulfill your end.  \n\nNow, I think it\u2019s stupid that the hotel wouldn\u2019t check you in anyway.  I mean, we technically required one of a few specific forms of ID, but as long as you had SOMETHING, I probably wouldn\u2019t refuse to rent to you.  In fact, I only really want your ID to make my case stronger in the event you attempt something like a CC chargeback, which you\u2019re doing anyway.\n\nIf the hotel is absolutely married to adhering to this policy 100% of the time (which is dumb), then you also entered into a contract that specified cancellation terms, or couldn\u2019t be canceled, depending.  \n\nThus, the hotel is legally correct and are entitled to whatever the no-show terms you agreed to are.  From experience, I can say the hotel wins this chargeback dispute about 80% of the time.  \n\nThat all said, I don\u2019t blame you for attempting the chargeback and find that, while contract law might be on their side, they are being unreasonable.

As some suggested, it is not about money but unethical practices by the Dr who withheld vital facts about the surgery to be performed.  \n\n\n\nFor everyone saying these organs have no function, here is what they do. Though you can live without these organs, they are important, and their removal can cause complications in as much so as them remaining can.\n\nThe human appendix is a small, tube-like structure attached to the large intestine, and for a long time, its purpose was not well understood. However, research suggests that the appendix may play a role in immune function, especially early in life, and it serves as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of its potential functions:\n\n1. Immune Support: The appendix is rich in lymphoid tissue, which is involved in immune responses. It may help the body identify and respond to infections, especially in the early stages of life when the immune system is still developing.\n\n\n2. Gut Flora Reservoir: The appendix might act as a safe harbor for beneficial gut bacteria. If the intestines are cleared of these bacteria due to illness (like diarrhea), the appendix can help reintroduce them to the gut, aiding in recovery and maintaining gut health.\n\nThe human gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located just beneath the liver. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver. Here\u2019s a closer look at how it functions:\n\n1. Bile Storage: The liver continuously produces bile, which is essential for digesting fats. However, the body doesn\u2019t need bile all the time, especially when no food is in the small intestine. The gallbladder stores this bile and holds it until it\u2019s needed for digestion.\n\n\n2. Bile Concentration: While stored in the gallbladder, bile becomes more concentrated, making it more effective in breaking down fats when it\u2019s eventually released into the small intestine.\n\n\n3. Release of Bile: When you eat a meal containing fats, hormones signal the gallbladder to contract and release bile through the bile ducts into the small intestine. There, the bile emulsifies fats, breaking them down into smaller molecules that enzymes can further digest and absorb.", "label": 1}

There are a lot of details that would help paint a clearer picture of my family dynamic as well, but truthfully it\u2019s not really about any of that. I came here to get perspective on if this was legally blackmail. If I was trying to have my character assessed by strangers I would have gone to that other sub. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m that afraid of my parents knowing\u2014I just wanted to have control over how they found out. \u201cAlienate\u201d was a poor choice of words. Probably more just fear that they would see me differently? My parents are elderly. They have traditional values. I didn\u2019t want to upset them. That\u2019s all. The facts here are that I didn\u2019t want to tell them until we were 12 weeks in and I wanted to tell them myself in my own way. Knowing that, she tried to use it as leverage to make me do something that I don\u2019t want to do: have a personal relationship with her that goes beyond caring for this child. I wanted to know if that met the standards of blackmail. That\u2019s all. \n\nIt\u2019s irrelevant now because I made a few phone calls and now everyone knows. It wasn\u2019t the way I wanted to do it, but my hand was forced.\n\nBelieve me, this is not some sweet little naive young girl and I\u2019m not some dumb kid running away from my responsibilities. I made a dumb decision, but I made it under false pretenses. The birth control that she told me she was on was Nexplanon, which is the most effective birth control available. If she had actually been on it and it wasn\u2019t expired, the chances of a pregnancy would have been effectively zero. My mistake was trusting that someone I didn\u2019t know very well was telling me the truth. \n\nIf we\u2019re being blunt, I\u2019ll be blunt too.

I will of course be doing everything in my power to do best by this kid in a very unfortunate situation. I do not believe that growing up with parents that are venomous toward each other is the move. I believe that if one party has to disengage with the other (with exceptions for things directly related to the pregnancy and the child) in order to keep the peace, then that\u2019s what they have to do. \n\nWould you feel differently if somebody limited their communication with the mother of their unborn child after said mother threatened to use her powerful legal connections to bury the father in the legal system until he severed all his rights and his only connection to his child would be paying child support? If not, what if she had used her experience as a therapist to reassure him and get him to open up about his fear of fatherhood and how he didn\u2019t want to be a dad. Then, weeks later, said she was going to use those things as evidence to pressure him into giving up his parental rights? Would you think that maybe there was some justification at that point to severely limit communication? Because guess what. \n\nDo you think that those things pertain to my original question?

{"text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experience; that sounds incredibly distressing. Here are some steps you might consider taking:\n\n1. Contact Law Enforcement: Since you were drugged and your well-being was compromised, it is essential to report the incident to the police if you haven\u2019t already. Provide them with as much detail as possible, including the timeline, location, and any witnesses who can corroborate your story.\n\n2. Document Everything: Write down a detailed account of everything that happened, including the timeline, descriptions of the bartender and owner, any conversations you had, how you got home, and any interactions with your neighbors and roommates. This documentation can be useful if you pursue legal action later.\n\n3. Seek Medical Attention: If you haven\u2019t already, consider seeing a doctor. They may be able to test for drugs that could have been used on you. Getting medical attention is essential for your health, especially if you experienced vomiting and disorientation.\n\n4. Legal Advice: Consult with an attorney who specializes in personal injury or premises liability. They can provide guidance on your options, including whether you may have a case against the casino for failing to provide a safe environment.\n\n5. Witness Testimonies: If any of your neighbors or friends witnessed your state after the incident, ask them if they would be willing to provide statements. Their accounts could strengthen your case.\n\n6. Contact State Regulators: You mentioned contacting the gambling commission and ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control). It may be worthwhile to follow up with them or inquire about filing a formal complaint regarding the establishment.\n\n7. Preserve Evidence: If you have any physical evidence (such as the clothes you wore that night), keep them in a safe place. They could be crucial in supporting your claims.\n\n8. Monitor the Situation: Keep track of any further incidents that might happen at that casino, as this could establish a pattern of unsafe behavior.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this situation, and it\u2019s important to seek support, whether that be through legal means or emotional support from friends, family, or professionals. Stay safe.", "label": 1}

If you have mutual friends, tell them you would prefer they do not say anything about you to her and that you don't want to hear anything about her.\nResources that will help you move forward in a safe way are usually found via your local domestic violence resources or online.

{"text": "I\u2019m not a lawyer or a Canadian, but Here\u2019s what Chat GPT says: In Ontario, Canada, the concept of community property does not apply. Instead, Ontario follows a \u201cseparation of property\u201d system within marriage, governed by the Family Law Act. When a marriage ends, either by divorce or death, property division is handled through a process called \u201cequalization of net family property\u201d rather than community property division.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic breakdown of how it works:\n\n\t1.\tEqualization of Net Family Property: When a marriage ends, each spouse calculates their \u201cnet family property\u201d (NFP), which is the value of all their property (assets minus debts) on the date of separation, minus the value they brought into the marriage. The spouse with the higher NFP owes the other spouse an equalization payment to achieve a fair division.\n\t2.\tExcluded Property: Some assets, such as gifts or inheritances received during the marriage, may be excluded from the equalization process, provided they haven\u2019t been co-mingled with marital property.\n\t3.\tOwnership of Property: Property acquired before or during the marriage belongs to the spouse who acquired it, and this ownership does not change upon marriage.\n\t4.\tMatrimonial Home: The matrimonial home, however, is treated differently. Both spouses have an equal right to live in the home, regardless of whose name is on the title. Upon separation, the entire value of the matrimonial home is included in the equalization process, even if one spouse owned it before marriage.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a legal matter regarding property division in Ontario, consulting a family lawyer would be helpful, as specific circumstances can affect property division.", "label": 1}

If the student has a horrible peanut allergy, or must carry an inhaler for asthma (bc all meds must have a script & med plan), maybe someone has epilepsy and could have a seizure in class & the instructor must know how to respond-that is pertinent for a teacher to know. Really depends on the medical plan and the need for it. As you can see, it really does become important for teachers to know about med plans for students. Especially when medical providers aren\u2019t on campus.", "label": 1}

The relationship must not be exploitative of the younger person.\n\nIn addition, Sections 375, 376, 376A, 376AA, 376EA, 376EC, 376EE, 377BL and 377D criminalize sexual activity with individuals below the age of 18 if the relationship is deemed exploitative of the younger person. Section 377CA stipulates that the court can determine if such a relationship is exploitative depending on the \"circumstances of each case\" - including age gap between the accused and the youth, the nature of the relationship, and the degree of control or influence exercised by the accused person over the minor. It also stipulates that - unless the accused is married to the younger partner - such relationships will be deemed exploitative until proven otherwise, if:\n\n(a) the accused person is the parent, step-parent, guardian or foster parent of the minor;\n(b) the accused person is the de facto partner of the parent, guardian or foster parent of the minor;\n(c) the accused person is a member of the teaching or management staff of the school or educational institution at which the minor is a student;\n(d) the accused person has an established personal relationship with the minor in connection with the provision of religious, sporting, musical or other instruction to the minor;\n(e) the accused person is a custodial officer of an institution in which the minor is detained;\n(f) the accused person is a registered medical practitioner, a registered traditional Chinese medicine practitioner or a psychologist and the minor is a patient of the accused person;\n(g) the accused person is an advocate and solicitor or a counsellor and the minor is a client of the accused person.\nIn addition, Section 376B criminalizes commercial sexual activity with youth under 18 - regardless of whether it occurs within or outside Singapore. Section 376D also further criminalizes attempting to travel outside Singapore for the purposes of committing such actions outside Singapore.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Most importantly, do you have a written contract?  If so, did it specify start time of 4 months?  Any start time documented at all?  Any/all time requirements listed in the contract?  In any event, it is now time for you to send him a letter, VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, insisting that he comply with the contract.  If the terms of the contract permit you to cancel (hopefully without penalty) at this time, I suggest you explicitly cancel and insist upon prompt return of your deposit (within the time-frame hopefully set forth in the contract, or, alternately, perhaps 2 weeks).  Give notice that you will file a lawsuit.  I suspect your causes of action would include, at least, \"breach of contract\" and/or \"unjust enrichment\".  Perhaps \"fraud\" as well.\n\nDue to the sums involved, you may be best off to engage a lawyer.  Yes, it will likely cost you at least several thousand dollars, but based on your post, I would not expect his contractor to return your money absent legal action.\n\nIf you cannot afford thousands of dollars of attorneys fees, you could always consider representing yourself pro se.  There is an excellent course online called \"The Pro Se Playbook\" available at [diyincourt.com](http://diyincourt.com) and this course covers the entire process from drafting and filing your summons and complaint through discovery, motions, and preparation to win at trial.  The course will also help you identify all of the causes of action you may have against this contractor.\n\n\n\nI hope this information is useful to you.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Hi, could not help but see that your cup runith ovr with a-holes , and thought maybe I can give you a few ideas to get you inspired to fight on. I KNOW all to well that feeling you have right now , aas far a s the judge not giving a shit, you are made to feel stupid because your RELAVENT PROOF , is suddenly NOT RELAVENT , and its like \"where /who do I go now?\" I still feel like that every time its a different injustice, and it takes me alot of energy to keep telling the story, to people who you realize 1/2 way through DO NOT care, which IS fine, but i wish they would just say it so you know where you stand with that person, and can move to the next one etc.. \n\nAnyways I wish to ask , you do not have to elaborate, but you hinted it out already. You were homeless ,and now you are not (ii.e. this apt is a Sec 8) and , you scored some transport(scooter/metro combo maybe?) and final big piece of the rebuilding was A GIG , or another , or better GIG , right? Well if this is correct, PLEASE know, that you have my congrats, respect, and my hand in BEATING the #$@& out of anyone who attempts to devalue your success , sabotages your continued work , or tries to remove , derail your current stabily .Now that was kinda a Joke, BUT I am kinda serious too, as I  am /have been / lived through the \"unhoused\" witch trials , and I feel that  people like your neighbor, TRUE EVIL,( as I said the dcooter guy , just a mental moron if at alll)\n\nAnd so there is alot of variables unknown to me to make a detailed recourse for you, and I cam NOT a lawyer, BUT I have oddly enough spent more time in COURT, for any illega events , to which I was never  rich enough to make go away , or guity enough for a slam dunk against me. So in appeared ALOT for myself and over time was witness to how the court works, and lots of mental notes of people  with way more fucked up problems etc, And I could take a guess as to the whole deal with her ,but I reelly dont want to make assumptions as to her story etc, her motive etc. , so if you would like to elaborate a bit on the situatiuon, a bit of backstory, how long u have been there, are there others in the shadows that stand with her? Sorry if I am rambling , but as i wanted to write some ideas , I am already basing her reasons from my own exp with neighbors., an I am bettin that she views you as previously homeless, however she found out , and forever will see you as the scourge of the Earth, which is like an epedemic here in L.A. Or she knows about the Sec 8 which means you pay less than her so she bitter, OR she hates cats and the above two making her a true AHOLE, BUT A PROBLEM non the less. AND as far as the Judge, againcould be many factors, BUT I you feel like taking a moment and think of ANY reason he may NOT findyou pleasant during court in session, or your own case,with himmaybe becoming irratated with your words actions or lack of, etc I say this because often those who spend all day in a court room , they tend to get  really bent out ofshape, if at time , a bright , resourceful, defendant comes in gonna self represent, and know nothing as to THEIR daily protcol ,The Ettiquite used, not to mention proper legal language used . A burst out loud, and out of turn , although innocent can put that Judge into a  mindset for the rest of your case .Hope to her more and i hope to help you turn this shit around \n\nSteven", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm not admitted to practice in either FL or TX so this isn't legal advice, but it's an interesting problem so I do want to comment.\n\nFirst, go hire a local LL/T lawyer.  You need boots on the ground to represent you.  And you can get his/her help in finding a management company if you're not going to sell it (and if you're going to sell, get your cpa on board and deal with the tax implications ASAP.)\n\nStrategies that are probably available to you: \n\nOne: pretend he might be telling the truth and send a notice/demand for the unpaid back rent (want a lawyer's advice for this since wording in the letter matters) that reads something like \"I don't believe that you actually have an agreement with my late father since Florida law requires, even for oral agreements, that any notices to or from the landlord be in writing and you've provided no documentation of any kind, it would appear that you're not being truthful.\"\n\nI might add something about the lack of documentation and payment history post death making it also unlikely but that you had been willing to work with him until he threatened you (the idea here is that the court needs to see you as the most reasonable person on the face of the earth.)  \n\nFL law says unwritten agreements (if the were actually to exist) can be as short as week to week:\n\n83.01\u2003Unwritten lease tenancy at will; duration.\u2014Any lease of lands and tenements, or either, made shall be deemed and held to be a tenancy at will unless it shall be in writing signed by the lessor. Such tenancy shall be from year to year, or quarter to quarter, or month to month, or week to week, to be determined by the periods at which the rent is payable. If the rent is payable weekly, then the tenancy shall be from week to week; if payable monthly, then from month to month; if payable quarterly, then from quarter to quarter; if payable yearly, then from year to year.\n\nSo, presume that the squatter was \"paying\" a market rate and say that he owes $x and that he needs to pay immediately.  This might also help with...\n\nTwo: just take the step of evicting him.  If you're the executor and the probate isn't closed, that's part of the job the estate probably will need to do (since the estate is the \"owner\" until a new title is recorded under your name.  This is likely to need to happen either way, so get started now.  Actually this is true even if you're not the executor.  Make the executor start the proceedings and name you as a co-plaintiff.\n\nI have heard that in similar situations, someone that has a legitimate lease agreement (and has taken the step of changing the utilities billing (and address)) could go onto the property when the squatter is out, throw out the squatter stuff, and call the police when the squatter tries to force entry.  Ive even heard that there might be services that help with doing this sort of thing.  This is just internet rumor type stuff and absolutely not any sort of a recommendation, legal or otherwise.\n\nOnce you recover the property, I'd seriously think about how much work you want to put into owning and maintaining the property.", "label": 1}

They'll get the same offer and same settlement range, unless they provide additional information. When they don't have new information to provide, they typically settle within that same range I had before they got in line for their contingency. \n\nI have no idea who you are and, perhaps, this doesn't apply to the way you practice. There are plenty of decent, honest attorneys out there and maybe you're one of them. However, anyone that makes blanket statements about an entire industry, painting all insurance companies as dishonest, unfair, well that should be a red flag to the claimant about who's trying to profit from their misfortune. There are some shady attorneys with sweet deals in place with even shadier doctors. What's an unnecessary injection or even surgery among friends, as long as they are getting their 30-50% of your settlement?  \n\nThere are good and bad insurance companies out there and the same is true of personal injury attorneys. Most attorneys put themselves out there as white knights, but regard them all with as much distrust as you have for the insurance company. If you are seeing a doctor they are paying for it sent you to and they are recommending surgery, experimental and expensive treatments, get a second medical opinion.", "label": 1}

{"text": "So I was driving from the border in Southern Arizona on the highway on a dark night from visiting a friend in a border town and I see 4 people on the side of the road 30 minutes into my drive in the middle of the highway hitchhiking in the middle of the desert. I pull over and I pick them up. I think nothing of it. I'm headed to Phoenix Arizona I tell them.that's where I live. They told me in Spanish yes please take us to Phoenix. I told him okay no problem. I stop at the next gas station buy them food and water they hadn't eaten in 10 days. They told me they were illegals that had crossed the mountain s 10 days ago. Two of them got stung by scorpions. They were in a group of seven. But three of them died crossing the desert. Six or seven hours later we make it to Phoenix. I take him to my house. Get them showered get them changed give them clothes. And let them use Facebook to contact the person they need to contact in Phoenix. They stay with me the next 3 days until the person they contact can come get them. 3 days pass and they're off in a whole new world living a better life than what they had in Mexico. About a week later. My door gets kicked in by US Marshals and I get taken in to federal prison. Little did I know. Along the highway they had cameras that take pictures of license plates and they had taken my license plate picture and that's all the information they needed to get me. They had charged me with trafficking illegals for profit. And they had charged me for working with the cartel for profit. I was looking at 15 years in federal prison. I hired a damn good lawyer and about $40,000 later I got 10 years supervised federal probation. The court case was dragged out for a year and 9 months. They go through your whole personal life. They go through your whole social media life. They subpoena all your phone records. The feds don't play. If I ever felt hopeless in my life it was against the feds. They had nothing on me except for a license plate picture and I was staring down the barrel of 15 years. They investigated all of my family members. It was disturbing. They brought it up in court how some of my family members were felons and I must be working for the cartel. When I finally got released on probation. I went to log into my social media. And everything that was attached to my phone number, or my email address was completely wiped off of social media. Like I said the FED don't play.", "label": 1}

{"text": "You\u2019re going to need to join the new Suboxone court case because that claim has to be post dated I think back in September. I\u2019m trying to send it post dated now but anyways people have gotten settlements you do however need to come across medication by indivior. There the ONLY MANUFACTURER THAT HAS BEEN HELD LIABLE. all of them do the same this is true but the reason they are being sued is because of the patent which prevented generic medication for years after it first came out. I used to pay 100 for a doctor and 300 for a script every month. Methadone is so much more effective for opioid tolerant and  experienced patients and intially chronic pain sufferers who suffer 2016 cdc old guidelines on oxy. But that clinic can be a bitch cdc just changed the guidelines where doctors at clinics can prescribe 28 days of methadone from the start of the medication  depending on cross addictions  fyi. Methadone is going to actually save the day once we can get refills and got to the doctors office which is also allowed pharmacies have to catch up but the final rule passed oct 2024 cdc final rule. Check it out. \n\nAnyway while you were taking them most insurance companies would pay for both it was really dependent on what brand your pharmacy carried. Unless insurance only would pay for name brand which I\u2019m fortunate but I think if you look close through your record you\u2019ll see you\u2019ve gotten a few scripts by that company. The bills you\u2019re going to get paid from are your dentists bills. You need to say your were prescribed to those but you don\u2019t have those records or something. You have to have had that brand before 2022 to be considered you\u2019ve just misplaced the record that what you\u2019ll have to say \n\nAnyways people are getting money depending on if they really took the long term and quit doing drugs as the medicine was intended. Obviously if they ask you did meth say no if heroin user which I know it\u2019s fucking absurd it\u2019s a stipulation but it can hurt your case so say no. The ok oxy script filled for years is what they want to hear and you lost and started to take subs because the clinic was a pain in the ass. That\u2019s the MO folks, if your not willing to play ball then your right your not going to get anything. I have 15 years of records with every script being brand name and losing a tooth or two every year for 15 years , abscesses 4-5 times a year at least. Shit load of pain bills and all that good shit so I\u2019m confident and have been told I\u2019m going to have no problems", "label": 1}
