Many of these variations have completely removed any weakness to silver, but kept vampire\u2019s non-reflective properties, even in non-silver mirrors. Even the weakness to crosses has become much less popular lately.\n\nThey have also gained and lost abilities. For example, you rarely see vampires turn into wolves anymore. Vampires and werewolves used to be much more closely related. It seems that, when their myths decoupled, werewolves took the silver weakness with them.\n\nInterestingly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of a werewolf not having a reflection.", "label": 0}
