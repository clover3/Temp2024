{"text": "Won a regional science fair as a 9 year old, 60+ years ago building crystal radios. I started with a germanium crystal in a  tiny metallic cup and used a safety pin as the moveable contact.  The coil was a paper towel tube wound with #24 lacquered copper wire.  To contact the coil, I used a metal strip from a Campbell\u2019s Soup can.  Luckily, a neighbor had a pair of headphones from a WWII aircraft.  I experimented with different antennas.  The best seemed to be a single wire ( old cloth-covered automotive) strung from the basement to a clothesline pole.  It was grounded to the galvanized plumbing of the house.  Thus, four terminals: antenna, ground, and two for headphones, all wired up with fahnestock clips, sitting on a chunk of 1x10. Received several AM stations clearly. No power needed.  In the pictures, the clip that looks a little like a telegraph key would be a great crystal holder.  Oh, the simple pleasures!", "label": 0}
