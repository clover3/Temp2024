{"text": "Cooking beef, chicken, and pork thoroughly is essential for food safety, flavor, and texture. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the reasons why each type of meat should be cooked to safe internal temperatures:\n\n# Chicken\n\n* **Risk of Harmful Bacteria**: Chicken commonly carries bacteria such as *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter*, which can cause serious foodborne illnesses if consumed undercooked.\n* **Temperature Requirement**: Chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to kill these bacteria.\n* **Texture and Flavor**: Properly cooked chicken is tender, juicy, and has a pleasant flavor. Undercooked chicken can be rubbery or mushy, while overcooking can make it dry and tough.\n\n# Beef\n\n* **Risk of Pathogens**: Whole cuts of beef are less likely to contain harmful bacteria inside, but surface bacteria, including *E. coli* and *Salmonella*, can pose a risk. Ground beef is more susceptible to contamination because bacteria on the surface get mixed throughout during grinding.\n* **Temperature Requirement**: Ground beef should be cooked to 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), while whole cuts, like steak, can be cooked to 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) with a 3-minute rest.\n* **Texture and Flavor**: Cooking beef enhances its flavor and tenderness, releasing the rich flavors and juices that people enjoy. Raw or undercooked ground beef poses a higher risk and may taste metallic or unpleasant.\n\n# Pork\n\n* **Risk of Parasites and Bacteria**: Pork may carry bacteria like *Salmonella* and, though rare, parasites like *Trichinella spiralis*, which can cause trichinosis if the meat is undercooked.\n* **Temperature Requirement**: Pork should be cooked to 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) with a 3-minute rest to ensure safety without overcooking.\n* **Texture and Flavor**: Properly cooked pork is juicy and tender, with a mild, savory flavor. Cooking also reduces toughness and improves overall palatability.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I doubt many places are allowed to treat livestock as bad as the industrial cattle farms in the US. And as far as Japan goes, cattle raised for wagyu meat are treated very well, comparatively. Here's an AI generated rundown:\n\nWagyu cattle are raised with a high degree of care, attention, and specialized management to ensure the quality of their beef. The practices can vary depending on the farm and region, but here are some general aspects of how Wagyu cows are treated:\n\n1. Breeding and Genetics\nWagyu beef comes from specific Japanese cattle breeds, with the most well-known being the Japanese Black (Kuroge Washu). The cattle are often carefully bred to maintain the desirable genetic traits associated with high-quality marbling.\nFarmers might use selective breeding to ensure the lineage remains pure, leading to the distinctive marbling and texture.\n2. Diet\nWagyu cattle are typically fed a high-energy diet that includes a mix of grains (like barley, corn, and wheat) and sometimes rice straw. This diet is designed to promote intramuscular fat, leading to the marbling Wagyu is famous for.\nThey may be fed this special diet for up to 600 days, much longer than typical cattle. The diet can be adjusted to each cow\u2019s needs, ensuring optimal growth and fat distribution.\n3. Living Conditions\nWagyu cows are often raised in a low-stress environment. They are given ample space and are sometimes raised in small herds to avoid competition and stress, which can affect meat quality.\nSome farms pay extra attention to cleanliness and comfort, ensuring the cows have soft bedding and are protected from extreme weather.\nIn Japan, farms might go to great lengths to ensure that the animals are calm, such as playing soothing music.\n4. Care and Management\nFarmers closely monitor the health of Wagyu cattle, checking their diet, weight, and general well-being. If a cow is stressed or unwell, it can affect the quality of the beef, so maintaining their health is a priority.\nThere\u2019s a belief that some Wagyu farmers massage their cattle to relieve muscle tension, although this is less common than popularly thought. However, it is true that some farms take extra steps to ensure cattle remain relaxed, including providing shade and comfortable living conditions.\n5. Longer Rearing Period\nWagyu cattle are often raised for a longer period compared to other beef cattle. While typical beef cattle are slaughtered at around 18-24 months, Wagyu may be raised until 30-36 months. This longer rearing period allows the cows to develop the characteristic marbling and flavor.\n6. Regional Differences\nDifferent regions in Japan (e.g., Kobe, Matsusaka, and Omi) have their own standards and traditions for raising Wagyu. For instance, Kobe beef comes from cattle raised in the Hyogo Prefecture, where strict criteria must be met to label the beef as \"Kobe.\"\nOverall, the treatment of Wagyu cattle is centered around minimizing stress, providing a balanced diet, and maintaining ideal living conditions to produce the highest quality beef.", "label": 1}

But I guess at least the first stage needs to burn out, so there is a minimum velocity.\n\nIn addition to lofted trajectories, another way to hit close targets is a \"depressed\" trajectory, where it flies on a low-altitude path. In that case there *is* some limitations on how short you can make it, because flying through dense atmosphere will put too big loads on the missile so you can't make it *too* low.\n\nI would guess if there is a limitation in how close you can launch it, it would mostly be in assumptions in the targeting software.\n\nYou often see stated that the ICBMs that Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union had a minimum range of 5,000km and therefore could not hit Moscow, but I have never seen any explanation of what this is based on.

{"text": "Even in stable atoms, there's a lot of uncertainty in what the actual configuration of the nucleus is. So that alone answers the question. But this is an especially pertinent factor when it comes to radioactive element decay chains. You see, after a nucleus flings off an alpha particle or an electron/antielectron and an antineutrino/neutrino to flip a nucleon from a neutron to a proton or vice versa, the nucleus you end up with afterwards, while lower energy than its predecessor, is usually not arranged in the most stable configuration for that isotope. So it reshuffles itself to minimize the electrical strain and energy levels of each individual nucleon. Much like how an electron going from a high to a low energy state emits a photon, this process also emits a photon - except since the particles here are jammed much closer together, the amount of strain reduced is much greater, so the energy released is greater as well. Hence, you see really high energy photons released in the process, which are gamma rays.", "label": 1}
{"text": "They are, and relative to their size the \"smearing\" is even more radical than it is for electrons. \n\nThe shell model of electrons treats full shells as basically being multiple copies of the single-electron orbitals. This works quite well because electron-electron interactions in most atoms are relatively weak compared to the electron-nucleus interaction. That lets you treat individual electrons as being like a \"smeared out\" version of themselves, regardless of what the other electrons are doing. \n\nIn a nucleus, there is no heavy central object whose location roughly organizes the behavior of the nucleons. Instead, you have to treat all of the protons and neutrons on equal-footing with each other. This ends up looking more like the collective behavior of condensed matter physics than the individual electrons of atomic physics.

{"text": "Yes, atomic nuclei can shift between different configurations, though it\u2019s a bit more complex than simply \"ordering\" protons and neutrons in specific ways. This behavior is governed by the principles of nuclear structure and quantum mechanics, and it can affect nuclear stability and energy levels.\n\nNuclear Shell Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe nuclear shell model describes how protons and neutrons in a nucleus occupy specific energy levels or shells, similar to electrons in an atom. In this model, protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons) fill discrete shells based on their energy. Certain configurations, particularly those with \"magic numbers\" of nucleons (like 2, 8, 20, 28, etc.), are exceptionally stable because these numbers correspond to completely filled shells, which minimizes the nucleus's energy.\n\nShape and Configuration Shifts\n\nSome nuclei can shift between different configurations or shapes due to internal nuclear forces:\n\nSpherical vs. Deformed Shapes: While some nuclei have nearly spherical shapes in their lowest energy state, others can adopt deformed (prolate or oblate) shapes. This shift between shapes can happen as nucleons interact within the nucleus, particularly when it\u2019s excited by energy (like from collisions or radioactive decay processes).\n\nIsomeric States: In some cases, nuclei can exist in isomeric states, which are long-lived excited states with distinct energy configurations. For example, the protons and neutrons may adopt different arrangements with respect to spin and pairing, resulting in higher or lower stability in each configuration.\n\n\nCollective Modes and Vibrations\n\nNuclei can also undergo collective modes of motion:\n\nVibrational States: Some nuclei can oscillate or vibrate, where nucleons move in collective patterns. This often occurs in heavier nuclei with many nucleons.\n\nRotational States: Deformed nuclei (those that are not perfectly spherical) can also exhibit rotational states, where the entire nucleus rotates, leading to specific energy levels associated with the rotational motion.\n\n\nNuclear Transitions\n\nThese configurations and shapes can affect how nuclei transition between energy levels, emit radiation, or undergo decay. For instance, a nucleus might shift between shapes or configurations as it moves to a more stable, lower-energy state, releasing energy as gamma rays in the process.\n\nIn summary, while nuclei don\u2019t have a simple, fixed set of configurations like a crystal structure, they do have preferred arrangements and shapes that correspond to minimum energy levels. These configurations and shapes can shift based on the nuclear forces and energy levels, resulting in the complex and fascinating behavior we observe in nuclear physics.", "label": 1}

Repeated vibration of the surface results in repeated compressions and rarefactions, which we hear as sound. \n\nThe amount of pressure difference between the compression and rarefaction is related to the volume of the sound. The speed of travel of the compressions and rarefactions is the speed of sound.\n\nA sonic boom is created by a surface moving through air at the same speed as sound.

However, these data have limitations in constraining certain aspects, like longitude or types of tectonic boundaries, and the available rock record becomes sparser with age. Advances over the past decade, including improved paleomagnetic data, quantitative tools like GPlates, and new methods like seismic tomography, have helped narrow uncertainties and allowed for more consistent reconstructions, even up to a billion years ago, as shown in recent studies.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Pressure scales linearly with depth, liquid density, and gravity. Water is essentially the same density in both examples, and Europa has \\~13% of earths gravity so the pressure would be roughly 13% of whatever it is on earth at the same depth. According to NASA Europa's oceans go to a depth of \\~150 km (you incorrectly used the depth in miles and labeled it km), which is equivalent to a earth depth of 19.5 km almost twice the depth and by extension pressure of anything on earth. There is only one submarine that has even gone to the bottom of earth's oceans, and based on it's tests it could make it to roughly \\~14km on earth if such depths existed or \\~105km on Europa. The vast majority of submarines on earth can only go a few hundred meters down on earth. \n\nNote that I ignored the ice crust for my initial calculations. This is because ice in that volume is structurally different than the ice we are used to on earth. In practice this probably means that it is slightly denser than typical ice and actually quite close to the density of water. You can probably just add it's depth to the water's depth for pressure calculations but this will give a slight over estimate. (max \\~8%)", "label": 1}
