If we go further back, GTA, Splinter Cell, Zelda, Sly Cooper, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, etc.\n\nGamers were able to get entries in these series very quick compared to today. This allowed the IP to create a foundational impression in consumers, so when GTA suddenly starts taking 10 years to develop, no one minds because the franchise has already proved itself with tons of prior entries.\n\nTLOU is kind of an anomaly because it was an absolutely amazing stand alone game. The sequel didn't come around for 7 years, but it didn't even need to come around to be remembered for decades to come. There are obviously other stand alone games that are fondly remembered, but most fall under the category where people WANT more. TLOU, I feel people were content with just the 1, which is honestly super rare when you think about it. No one wanted more from that IP, but not because it was bad.\n\nRed Dead is another. I think people were perfectly content with it being the only one (even though it technically was the second in the franchise). And it didn't really need the sequel 8 years later.\n\nTry to think of a new IP trilogy starting from the PS4 and I think you will realize the difference in how IPs struggle to gain that same foothold as IPs of the past.\n\nThe 2000-2013 era of games was absolutely insane when it came to production quantity and quality.

Seriously, even from a materialistic standpoint you only get like <10% less Adam when saving the girls, and you get special plasmids and tonics and other goodies to boot.

Or at least make it very late in the game when you are given the gifts, at least that would sort have had a \"it was worth the trouble\".

{"text": "While I agree that attention to detail can really drive home plot points and character development, I don't think characters wearing the same outfit for the game's entirety can affect story immersion or quality. And even if it did, it depends on the game and the character's current situation. Like, does the character even have the time to go out and buy a new set of clothes and the time to put them on? The Kingdom Hearts series has a great story (to accompany great gameplay) and the main character doesn't wear different outfits very often. For example in the first Kingdom Hearts game, Sora has exactly one outfit throughout the entire game except for when he enters Halloween Town (From Nightmare Before Christmas) and Atlantica (From Little Mermaid). The former he has a Halloween inspired variation of his default outfit and the latter he's shirtless with a merman's lower half. Although he has the one outfit for majority of the game, the story is still very good and hits you right in the feels at the end. The lack of varying outfits doesn't affect the quality of the plot. However, if different outfits truly mean that much to you I recommend the Persona games. Sometimes the outfits are just that, outfits, with no real connection or deeper meaning, there's a lot of them in each game, some are references to past games and others are goofy and silly. In Persona 5, they get a bit more creative with the outfits. When entering a dungeon, each party member's outfit is inspired by their metaphorical hearts or as per the game's wording \"Will of Rebellion\". Each character has a winter and summer uniform for school days, and a winter and summer casual outfit for days off. They're great games with amazing stories and well written characters. The games run long though, the most recent one, Persona 3 Reload, is roughly 90 hours so it's certainly a time investment. Definitely worth it though.", "label": 0}

{"text": "That's the problem, this is starting to become pay-to-win, as in \"you can't remain competitive without this\". Even if the company doesn't want to do this, and really wants to keep the game playable, it will fail. Because it'll notice that a huge chunk of its players are running out of content and stuff to do (because of the time savings in not having to go back to a city for the AH or access their mail) so they'll have to keep adding content, at a point that the only way to access and enjoy all the content is to have the mount. And then it becomes full pay-to-win.\n\nPersonally, if I were in the room, I'd propose instead a \"pay-to-recover\" mechanic. Basically you can pay a small amount of money and get a boost that lets you move quickly through content that is a bit stale and \"catch-up\" to where the average is, but the new competitive content still requires the challenge. I can see a lot of players that want to play and see all the content, but also cannot have consistent playtime, they're parents and can't play over the summer, or they're grad-students and can only play over the summer, etc. etc. So you pay a little extra, and it lets you play the past dungeons and raids with a much more generous drop-rate, that lets you get a lot of the previous season's items and armor and be able to be competitive. Or you can choose not to pay, grind through the lower-tier dungeons and then use that to catch-up, though you won't be as good as you would be with the drops from previous raids. Something like that. So there's an incentive to pay (in order to catch up) but the end-game remains a very egalitarian situation.", "label": 0}

You know what harvesting gets you, and you know you are promised extra rewards if you choose save instead.  Choosing to at least see what her first reward is before making the decision going forward is pretty normal behavior, and you don't need a spreadsheet of the long run versus short term rewards.  The *very first* gift is 200 ADAM and an extreamly powerful plasmid you cannot get otherwise.  You know from the *first zone* that the actual difference is less than 10%, not half, and honestly with the very first plasmid being able to control a big daddy, I know I wasn't exactly questioning if the extra loot would be worth that <10%.\n\nI don't mind the prospect of being paid back, though I do think you effectively just getting that ADAM back does feel kinda lazy.  But even if they are going to give it back, it probably shouldn't be so soon.
