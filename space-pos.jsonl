Turning the wheel moves a gate or disk inside the valve, which either blocks or allows water flow. Turning the wheel clockwise typically restricts or shuts off water, while counterclockwise opens the flow.\n\nKey components include the handwheel (usually metal or plastic), a stem connecting the wheel to the gate or disk, and the valve body, made from materials like brass or PVC. Gate valves are ideal for fully open or closed positions, while globe valves offer more precise flow control.\n\nThese valves are widely used in household, commercial, and industrial plumbing, as well as irrigation systems. The wheel design offers leverage, making it easy to control or completely stop water flow as needed.", "label": 1}

The Space Force was\u00a0established in 2019\u00a0by then-president Donald Trump, who is vying for re-election next week.\n\nThe US military has long been using space-based assets for communications and missile targeting. For China, space has become an\u00a0increasingly crucial domain\u00a0in its quest to put one of the US military\u2019s traditional strengths at risk.\u00a0\n\nBeijing has dismissed US claims its increasingly sophisticated space programme poses any danger to other countries. The foreign ministry accused Washington this year of \u201crepeatedly hyping up China\u201d as a threat as \u201can excuse for the US to expand its forces in outer space and maintain military hegemony\u201d.\n\n\ufffcUS Air Force Academy cadets before they were commissioned into the US Space Force. The space force was established in 2019 by then-president Donald Trump \u00a9 Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\n\nAs part of\u00a0large-scale military reforms\u00a0started in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping combined space, information and cyber warfare operations under the Strategic Support Force, a new arm of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nIn April Xi launched another restructuring that in effect dissolved the SSF and puts its functions under direct control of the military leadership, in a sign that he seeks to enhance space, cyber and information operations.\n\nBoth Russia and China have\u00a0tested satellites with capabilities\u00a0that include grappling hooks to pull other satellites out of orbit and \u201ckinetic kill vehicles\u201d that can target satellites and long-range ballistic missiles in space.\n\nIn May, a senior US defence department official told a House Armed Services Committee hearing that Russia was developing an \u201cindiscriminate\u201d nuclear weapon designed to be sent into space, while in September China made a third secretive test of an unmanned space plane that could be used to disrupt satellites.\n\nThe US is far ahead of its European allies in developing military space capabilities but it wanted to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the continent\u2019s space forces, Saltzman said. Last year UK Air Marshal Paul Godfrey was appointed to oversee allied partnerships with Nato with the US Space Force \u2014 one of the first times that a high-ranking allied pilot has joined the US military.\n\nBut Saltzman warned against a rush to build up space forces across the continent.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is resource-intensive to separate out and stand up a new service. Even\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009in America where we think we have more resources, we underestimated what it was going to take,\u201d he said.\n\n\ufffcFor China, space has become an increasingly crucial domain in its quest to put one of the US military\u2019s traditional strengths at risk \u00a9 Adek Berry/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe US Space Force, which monitors more than 46,000 objects in orbit, has about 10,000 personnel but is the smallest department of the US military.\u00a0Its officers are known as \u201cguardians\u201d.\n\nThe costs of building up space defence capabilities mean the US is heavily reliant on private companies, raising concerns about the power of billionaires in a sector where\u00a0regulation remains minimal.\n\nSpaceX, led by prominent Trump backer Elon Musk, is increasingly working with US military and intelligence through its Starshield arm, which is developing low Earth orbit satellites that track missiles and support intelligence gathering.\n\nThis month, SpaceX was awarded a $734mn contract to provide space launch services for US defence and intelligence agencies.\n\nDespite concerns about Musk\u2019s erratic behaviour and reports that the billionaire has had regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saltzman said he had no concerns about US government collaboration with SpaceX.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable that they\u2019ll execute those [contracts] exactly the way they\u2019re designed. All of the dealings I\u2019ve had with SpaceX have been very professional,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Kathrin Hille in Taipei", "label": 1}

The tidal force on a body at a black hole\u2019s event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole\u2019s mass: a person at the event horizon of a 10 million M\u2609 black hole experiences about the same tidal force between their head and feet as a person on the surface of the Earth. Unlike with stellar-mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole\u2019s event horizon.", "label": 1}

We had an army and navy then created the marines. We never suspected we would have any other forms of conflict. And then planes came into existence and proved we would need another form of military. Now we have Space flight and other countries, at least 2 that are antagonistic towards us, have spaceflight capabilities. It was in this thread I found out China has its own space station.

Following the birth of the universe, the Noo lived in the moments where there was no order in the cosmos. When the universe came into existence there was only chaos when matter did not follow the laws of physics. In this cruel world there was only inferno and pain with the Noo being the rulers of space. They were considered the actual condition of primal space itself and ruled the universe through terror where they created slaves for themselves. This period was described as being akin to Hell with shadows and pain spiraling around with the only emotion given to the conscious being fear. At this time, from the chaos of shadows, came the first signs of order in the form of the Twisted Rope which was DNA that was born. \n\n>As time passed on, the clan of the Twisted Rope were unable to bear the control of the shadow of the Noo. Thus, they began a revolution and used the chain of space and the arrows of time against them. The actions of the Twisted Rope led to the lords of shadow being sealed at the very edge of dimensions. Bound in chains, the spirit of the Noo was sealed away within the far reaches of space whilst the remaining body was shattered by the arrow of time that spread all over the universe.\n\n> Since that moment, space was able to move forward and flowed along the flows of time. All these events occurred in a single instant in less than one-tenth of a second after the creation of the universe namely within Planck time. This was when the universe was smaller than elementary particles and was a horribly dense place. These moments were a time when the laws of physics could not be applied. These seconds since the creation of the universe was an incident dense enough in importance to match billions of years worth of time.", "label": 1}

Go ahead and list his credentials related to Tibet. \n\nWe can ignore his inherent bias and that he had a conclusion made up before writing or researching anything else. But we can\u2019t ignore the fact that he made basic mistakes that an undergraduate student wouldn\u2019t make (origin of the Dalai Lama) or his sources relating to slavery.\n\nWhen he makes this slavery claim he can only relies on and cites two \u201cSources\u201d: Gelders and Strong. They were some of the first foreigners in Tibet after China invaded. They were invited by the CCP as they were pro-CCP sympathizers and already showed their support beforehand. They knew nothing about Tibet and needed to use CCP approved guides for their choreographed trip. Strong was even an honourary member of the Red Guards and Mao considered her to be the western diplomat to the western world. There are reports of Tibetans being told what to say when Strong came. They aren\u2019t regarded as credible or reliable and yet the only sources Parenti has for this slavery claim. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Parenti doesn\u2019t mention Alan Winington who was a communist and supporter of the CCP,  but maybe that\u2019s because he makes no mention of slavery or the other supposed abuses that Gelders and Strong write about.\n\nParenti also cherry picked so badly from Goldstein that he dishonestly represents his work. But should we talk about what Goldstein writes on the matter?\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why no one in this field takes this seriously.
