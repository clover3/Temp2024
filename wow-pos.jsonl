That is probably the worst thing to have happened in this game since it's inception which I've been playing since.  That is also not the current bug in the current patch which is what the overwhelming majority are crying about.\n\nIf I had been subject to losing everything and being told there was nothing that could be done... I would have quit the game.  I wouldn't have an opinion on this mount because I would have quit and never played again.  When I don't get what I expect at any business I don't go back.  I'm not making excuses for them, I'm simply saying that if people lost everything and continued to subscribe they were apparently less bothered by it than they claimed.\n\nThe current bugs aren't that insane.  Yes Rogue has issues, Does that mean nothing can be played? No.  Do I think they will fix the game busting issues quickly? Yes I do.   Do I think it'll be quickly enough for people to not scream about it? Not even if they found a time machine and went back and fixed it before it happened would that satisfy some people.  This game and most mmos are always a cycle of new content, bugs, fixes, new content.  At any point that someone feels like it's too much they can easily remove themselves from the content.

You can't just join a random group and play and have fun anymore. For example, there is an addon called raiderio, it basically tracks your performance in dungeons & raids (something like that, I have never used it, someone else can explain it better). But basically, if you don't have a HIGH IO score, teams will not even let you in. So all the mythic & raid teams in the dungeon finder that you request to join will see that you either a) don't have an IO score (Like me, cuz I refuse to use the stupid addon), or b) you have an IO score that is not in the top 10% percentile, and they will ignore all your requests to join the team. You might also be refused admittance to a team if your ilevel is too low, in their opinion. If you just join a random normal dungeon team, people will kick you for any reason, including: a) they don't like your name, b) you're character is a void elf c) you make a single mistake like aggro something d) they fucked up, but they blame it on you and call a kick vote for you. Everyone automatically votes yes for all kick votes btw, whether you did anything or not, especially if you are dps. \n\nIf you want to do the highest level endgame raiding and mythics, you'll quickly hate life. If you just truly casual though, the game can be perfectly enjoyable to play solo. You'll just never get the highest ilevel possible.

But since I've been polite and there's been dialogue up to that point, if you get aggressive and act like an asshole, then you're in the wrong.\n\nTo move back to what happened here though? That's not what I got. I got told \"Shouldn't use pawn anyway.\" even though I didn't ask for feedback or imply it was welcome.

{"text": "It's crazy to me how quickly this conversation turns to \"You just want Blizzard to give you rewards/you just want participation trophies for everything/Do you have a problem with prestige and good players having nice things\" whenever this topic comes up.  \n\n\nLet's be real for a moment: It's a digital commodity, and FOMO tactics aren't put in place to make you the player feel rewarded for your hard work. It has nothing to do with the game's philosophy and how players feel they should be rewarded, because at the end of the day:  \n\n\n**LIMITED TIME CONTENT IS NEVER ABOUT SKILL AND IS ALL ABOUT PRESSURING YOU TO PLAY MORE AND PLAY NOW.**\n\nThe developers are totally happy for taking recolors away, because it's bait. Bait to make you play more. Bait to keep you subbed and engaged. It's never been about prestige, and if we're being honest with ourselves, we'd be more frank about it.\n\nLet's talk about the pandaren phoenixes since that was being discussed fairly frequently during remix. People wanted these to come back because they didn't have the opportunity, while a vocal group came out and spoke widely against it. Even some people who didn't have the phoenixes started talking about how their prestige would be lost if they were added to MoP Remix.\n\nAs someone who has the panda phoenixes, I have to ask: **What prestige are we talking about????** \n\nGetting the **SILVER RANK TIMES** across the board wasn't really all that bad. Hell, taking harder CMs into account (Stormstout Brewery, uhg, even getting all *GOLD* wasn't that bad. The only thing that ever made it rough was if you were playing one of the few specs that got absolutely RAILED by the scaling (Boomies were pretty low performing in CM due to haste scaling), and even then, that was easily circumvented if you wanted the armor set. But we're talking about **the silver rank.** Not even the best of the best. Silver could be accomplished fairly damn easily if you knew a basic rotation and how to play WoW.\n\nBut oh my god, Billy's going to have a stroke if he sees another player outside of he and I riding a Crimson Pandaren Phoenix.\n\nMy 'prestigious' reward right now just feels the same as a promo T-Shirt I got for showing up, and yet someone is way too defensive over theirs. \n\nI don't think it's weird that other people like your cool T-Shirt or my cool T-shirt and maybe want to also wear the cool T-shirt. I DO think it's weird that other people have to go on this long-winded diatribe about how 'your generation' just wants everything just handed to them or have everything reduced to a participation trophy' while getting weirdly defensive about my T-shirt. \n\nI will never think it's weird to want something.  \nI will think it's weird as shit to get mad at the thought of others having an opportunity to show skill and earn something you feel should stay 'exclusive'. \n\nYou're not special for being \"good at WoW.\" No one is.

{"text": ">Ad Hominem attacks all because you're struggling to use your words?\n\nOh internet debate buzzwords activated.\n\nIt's mostly to do with the fact I've repeated the same thing 6 times and you're still having real difficulty. That isn't ad hominen that's an actual observation of what's happened. Nice try though.\n\n>No, you're trying to backtrack now \n\nCan you point to where EXACTLY I said anything but the spirit healer was intentional? Like can you point that out for me? I FULLY believe you misunderstood me, but that isn't the same as me backtracking.\n\n>they're trying to fix the obvious bug. You even said there in plain text where you qualified your statement with meaning, \"it's trendy to be mad at bugs that aren't bugs\". You were clear enough in your meaning.\n\nI've been nothing but completely explicit babes. That's the issue I've now explained it in plain black and white for about 4-5 posts and your comeback is basically \"nuh uh!\".\n\nI said, that being ressed by the spirit healer in Brill, was an intentional thing. Whether it's a temporary workaround, or laziness I don't know (nor does anyone) however that behaviour is entirely intentional. We know that because the BG spirit healer **was placed there by a fucking human**.\n\n>I can't comment on the spirit healer as I think it was added back in Shadowlands, however I really don't care\n\nYes you only care about your little mouthpiece soapbox moment. I've been pretty clear about that. That's a shame because **that is exactly what I've been talking about the entire fucking time**. Again I'm sorry you misunderstood plain English.\n\n> but that was never my issue with what you said.\n\nYour issue, and I cannot overstate this enough is that you think that I said \"OH YOU DYING IN UNDERCITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTENTIONAL\" and again, I didn[t say that. I said you ressing in Brill was intentional. I also said it is more convenient. Which on both counts is completely accurate.\n\n>You're extremely unclear and your thoughts are all over the shop.\n\nCan you point to literally anywhere I have said anything other than the spirit healer in this entire post top to bottom?", "label": 1}
