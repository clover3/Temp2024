Surprisingly, this \u201cbirth time\u201d isn\u2019t a fixed moment. Instead, it\u2019s a quantum superposition, meaning the **electron essentially exists in multiple moments at once**\n\n> \u201cThis means that the birth time of the electron that flies away is not known in principle. You could say that the electron itself doesn\u2019t know when it left the atom,\u201d highlighted Joachim Burgd\u00f6rfer.\n\n> \u201cIt is in a quantum-physical superposition of different states. It has left the atom at both an earlier and a later point in time.\u201d\n\n> The energy of the electron remaining in the atom is also uncertain. If the remaining electron has higher energy, the escaping electron probably left earlier. If the remaining electron has lower energy, the escaping electron probably left a bit later (on average, **232 attoseconds** later, which is incredibly fast).\n\n> \u201cHowever, these differences can not only be calculated, but also measured in experiments,\u201d concluded Joachim Burgd\u00f6rfer.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1gc2l8i/billionth_of_a_billionth_of_a_second_quantum/ltqgfu9/", "label": 0}

But so are these:\n\n\u2022 The spins are set as opposite, but the spins of each particle are undefined. You will always get opposite spins, but it is **not** true that either particle has a specific spin already. That is randomly decided when you measure it, and whichever one you measure second will have the opposite spin to the one you measure first.\n\n\u2022 This effect appears to be instant. As in, faster than the speed of light, which means faster than something should physically be able to cause an effect. And it does so seemingly without actually sending any kind of force carrier through space to reach the other particle.\n\nPeople like to use the analogy of putting a pair of shoes into two boxes and then handing each box to someone else to look at. In that case, the person who gets the left shoe will instantly know that the other person got the right shoe. \n\nThat's a flawed analogy, because which box had the right shoe and which had left was pre-defined. That's not how quantum stuff works. In the quantum world, the universe itself doesn't know which shoe is in which box, and as soon as someone opens a box it just picks one or the other to show them.

That's a 28-day supply, 1x injection each week for 4x weeks. So you have 4x pens, 60mg total, 200 units of fluid. Now imagine a compound pharmacy taking a 15mg pen/dose and splitting the fluid into 3x 5mg doses. So now that 1x 15mg 50 unit dose is 3x 5mg 16.6666 unit doses. Now let's say you add other ingredients such as B12 to each shot, and maybe some bacteriostatic water which is a sterile solution (I think it adds some preservatives as well). Now each of those 3x 5mg dose shots are more like 50 units of fluid due to the added ingredients. Scale it up and sell thousands of these compounded shots and you have yourself a business. Now, whether they obtain the medicine in the form of those pens like consumers, or they somehow get large dose vials directly from the manufacturer, I would not know.\n\nThat's a compounded shot, it's literally the medicine from the manufacturer split into custom doses and mixed with other ingredients. A generic medication, even though it uses the exact same active ingredient, is absolutely not the same thing.

Now, Balaji says he sees the technology being used for things he doesn\u2019t agree with, and believes that AI companies are \u201cdestroying the commercial viability of the individuals, businesses and internet services that created the digital data used to train these A.I. systems,\u201d the Times writes.", "label": 0}

This has been *routinely* experimentally verified for photons, electrons, and even whole atoms. \n\nThe premise is that you have a detector placed at one end of your setup, something capable of shooting individual photons, electrons, or atoms at the detector at the other, and a barrier with two slits cut into it in the middle.\n\nIf--as you suggest--each particle has a pre-defined state, you'd expect that your detector would light up precisely behind those two slits, as each particle passes through one or the other of the slits (or is blocked by the barrier, and the detector doesn't register anything).\n\nThat's not what happens. Instead, what happens is that the detector lights up in a pattern that can **only** be the result of a *wave* passing through both of the slits at once and interfering with itself. And that can only happen if the particle is truly in a superposition of states--that is, it passes through both slits simultaneously--before detection. \n\nI realize that \"this is what science says\" is more of an appeal-to-authority fallacy than a real argument, but seriously--google it. This *is* the accepted science on the topic, and my relatively-informed-but-still-layman explanation can't do it proper justice.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-MNSLsjjdo) is a PBS Spacetime video that goes over this particular type of experiment.

They're just remarkable for their worth, but not good. \n\nThe reason LLMs \"hallucinate\" \\*\\*so often\\*\\*, is just because they're just text predictors. They dont have reasoning skills - at all. Aside from Transformer-based models like ChatGPT, we have NLNs, GNNs, Neuro-Symbolic Models, which their purpose alone is to make AIs with reasoning. Well, ChatGPT or any popular LLM is not ... that.\n\nIf you convinced/gaslighted an LLM that Tolkien's elf speech is normal english, they would \"believe you\", because they have no reasoning skills. It's just a machine trained to predict what is the right order of characters to respond with.\n\nThe reason it gives the illusion of reasoning or sophistication, is because the AI has decades worth of training data and billions $$$$ were used to train it. It's so much data, that it really has built the illusion that it's more than it really is. We're talking about Terabytes of just text. \n\nChatGPT o1 what it has done to deepen that \"Reasoning illusion\" is to literally re-feed its own output to itself, making it one of the most expensive LLMs out there. That's why you almost instantly get a \"max tokens used\" type of message because its super inefficient, and it still wont ever be able to achieve true reasoning. I still managed easily without hacks to make it mistake the basic \"Wolf-Sheep-Shepherd\" riddle, didnt even gaslighted it.\n\nProving that this whole thing is a hype bubble because the dust has not settled yet. OpenAI is constantly trying to gaslight people, and it makes more difficult for the dust to settle. But it slowly does compared to early days of hype. AI has existed since the 60's. The only reason this super hype marketing is happening now is because we got huge amounts of $$$$ suddenly invested into it and there is so much data \"free\" on the internet.", "label": 0}

Looking at the source for their 'analysis' of Part 4 of the fair use test (\"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work\") doesn't fill me with confidence that this is anything else than a hit piece. It's been known for years that less people visit Stack Overflow (e.g. because it gets more toxic all the time, questions get just closed as off-topic or duplicate for no good reason), that the volume of Stack Overflow questions has been going down (because most trivial questions have been asked and it's not really as good for non-trivial questions as people hoped) and that there is in general an decrease in new people using SO. Taking these existing trends, but trying to frame them as being the result of ChatGPT (by only showing five weeks before the ChatGPT release and fifteen weeks after, so the trend is less obvious) is lying using statistics.\n\nUsing such a weak source is already a red flag, but then the author continues with making assumptions that support the intended result, which is unscientific. If whatever you want to produce should have any scientific value and not just the veneer of scientific language you need to consider all information and not just cherry pick those that support your conclusion.\n\nSo, all in all, as I said above: This is a hit piece. The information contained can be summed as \"I think it is the case. I won't elaborate.
