(Or shortly thereafter).\n\n\n\nMy point that I didn't make was that that none of the Constitution is exempt from being amended, whether it's the Bill of Rights, the original Constitution minus the Bill of Rights, or any subsequent amendments. The idea that the Founding Fathers were omniscient Gods and that none of the stuff in the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights should ever be altered is what I was arguing against.\n\n\n\nI did not know about the Federalists and the history of the Bill of Rights being designed to protect the rights of the people, which weren't enumerated in the original constitution, nor do I know the history of the Articles of Confederation. I appreciate the insight you've added in your comment.\n\n\n\nMaybe my comments implied something that I didn't intend, but my point was that the Constitution isn't the Bible and the Founding Fathers weren't all-knowing oracles of the future.

{"text": "Interesting graph, but the comments are using this to circle jerk unions and that\u2019s a bit silly honestly. Like yeah, obviously union pay is going to be higher. In industries where it isn\u2019t, nobody would join the union and it\u2019d instantly have no reason to even exist. We wouldn\u2019t see those examples on a chart. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean unions are automatically \u201cgood\u201d and have no flaws. They have pros and cons. They\u2019re pretty good for workers who have been in the union, bad for those who aren\u2019t, and obviously costly for employers. They\u2019re only VERY good for union bosses who collect dues. The way unions work is that pay for union workers is higher at the expense of pay for workers outside the union. This happens because non-union workers can\u2019t get hired or paid as well due to the agreements created between unions and employers that force certain employers to only use union labor. Union leaders in these cases are essentially just restricting labor supply for employers, in turn driving up labor costs (in the form of higher pay) for union workers. When you factor in the dues that unions require though, the gap between non-union and union pay has to be large for it to even start to be worth it for the workers in the union, and the workers outside of the union are still worse off because they can\u2019t compete with the same job supply. \n\nPeople on Reddit glaze unions as a blanket pro-worker thing, but they only kinda are. They\u2019re good for workers already in a good union, bad for workers in a shitty union that don\u2019t negotiate well but have high dues, and bad for workers not in a union.
