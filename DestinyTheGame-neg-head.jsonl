The DM rolls the die, and unknown to you or the DM, the d6 has a factory defect; there is a void inside it biasing the die to roll 1s. The rewards aren't weighted to produce more pocket lint than magic swords, there is an equal chance on the table of loot for either.

Directly adjacent perks were still common, but the whole thing seems it inverted- in Forsaken the bands starting at 1/4 and 1/5 were actually hot zones with the outer corners being uncommon as well, whereas now 1/2 and 1/3 and those outer corners are hot zones.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">There is no guarantee that every perk roll/combination will be evenly distributed and there is no way to test if something is \"random enough\"\n\nI didn't respond because this is just fundamentally wrong, there are tests for judging how similar an observed value is to an expected value. You can in fact test a dataset to see if the distribution is sufficiently uniform. This is like the fundamental building block of the entire field of statistics and the concept of probability.\n\nWith that being said, would you like to revisit how bad and unrepresentative the community data is, and how it's definitely a uniform distribution that's just being skewed by bad data collection and presentation?\n\nYesterday from @Destiny2Team: \n\n>We are now investigating a potential issue within our code for how RNG perks are generated.\n\n>Many thanks to all players who have been contributing to data collection across the community. This data has been monumentally helpful with our investigation, and we are currently working on internal simulations to confirm your findings.\n\nToday from @Destiny2Team:\n\n>Our team has been working through community-sourced data and internal simulations to reproduce reported issues regarding legendary weapon perk RNG.\n\nAfter investigation, we can confirm an issue has been found in our code where some random perk combinations are harder to earn per legendary weapon perk set. In some cases, desirable perk combinations are a bit easier to earn as well. While we inspected our content and confirmed each perk is weighted equally, an issue in perk pool RNG is the culprit here.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I completely disagree, personally. To go through your complaints, though:\n\nYes, the bosses have a lot of health, BUT they're also very unique in how you do damage to them. If you decide to just use a rocket or grenade launcher, you won't do good damage since you're not playing to the strengths of each fight. For example, the final boss has a ton of health, but also an extremely long dps phase, so if you bring something with enough ammo to last the whole time, you'll do great.\n\nAs for the softlocks, that one is definitely an issue and needs to be fixed asap, but every softlock is caused by people doing something they shouldn't, so just don't do those specific things and you'll be fine.\n\nNext, the lightning is supposed to be a 1 shot, regardless of being in a Well or Bubble. The whole point is to make you move around during dps, just like Bungie did with the Witness in Salvations Edge. It's something Bungie did very well. Of course they want to do it again.\n\nFor your complaint about the servitor boss resetting when you shoot the wrong number, just shoot the right ones? There's no timer, and you're able to look at the number before you shoot it. Just take the extra second and double-check.\n\nLastly, the armor thing is a valid complaint, but it is far from being an exclusive issue for Vesper.

Most dungeons have been difficult on release (with bosses requiring 2-3 phases). If you are comparing it to stuff that has been in the game for 2-3 years than the difficulty is going to seem like a complete 180. Powercreep is a thing and you can feel it in the older dungeons. That doesn't mean that was how they were shipped.\n\nPersonally, I like the active final boss. By far the most chaotic encounter we have right now. It requires awareness, ad clear and dmg. You can have one person focus on clones while the other 2 do dmg. And he is a pretty easy 2 phase with a handful of weapons. \n\nOverall, there are some bugs but the dungeon as a whole is in a good spot and easily my favorite out of the bunch.

When you roll two dice, the chance of getting a specific sum is not equal (like craps--7s are more common than snake eyes or boxcar). \n\nBut this is a dumb reason to normalize probabilities because the sum of two perks means nothing from a gameplay standpoint. While a dice roll of 4 and 2 is the same sum as 2 and 4, they are totally different perk-wise.\n\nFinally, it looks like this probability normalization appears to be designed for a 4 x 4 combination of perks.

{"text": "> For the last few years, more times than not, it has actually worked in our favor.\n\nI don't think so. Assuming each weapon has one 'god-roll' combo, and that where that god-roll is positioned in the perk slots is uniformly distributed, having a weighted perk combination table will increase the expected number of drops to get a god-roll on average.\n\nFor example, if you take the Perfect Paradox data [here](https://d2-loot-tracker.vercel.app/rolls) and assume that the observed drop rate exactly matches the expected value for any 6x6 weapon, then create 36 new weapons each with their god-roll in a different position, the expected value of the total number of focused drops needed to collect all 36 different god-rolls would be ~4019, while with a uniform drop distribution it would be only 1296.0 drops - a difference of over three times as much.\n\nThe actual historical results might have been different. It's possible that the god-rolls on meta guns might historically have fallen more towards the favorable slot combinations, whether by chance or some quirk of the human-involved design process.\n\nAlso of note is that we have only considered the third and fourth columns, and I haven't seen any data or analysis of first/second column combos and masterworks. First/second column is interesting because for most guns those columns are a fixed pool in a fixed order, so if there is similar correlation it could mean that certain combos of first/second perks are more likely, and if that lands on desirable combos it means more likely 5/5 god-rolls, but if not it would mean the inverse.", "label": 0}

{"text": "3v3 kinda sucks in this game. I don't enjoy being put randomly on a shit team in Trials against either stacks or a much better team. I have no patience for wasting my time that is limited. I thought Trials was okay before the expansion ended. I thought it was improving. They completely fucked it up. I won't even touch 3v3 anymore. It's garbage. 6v6 is tolerable, but I wish we had 4v4 or 5v5 comp. Trials can stay 3v3, but in reality I just don't give a fuck about it. I don't want to commit that many games to that shitty RNG in a 3v3 mode. I just don't really enjoy 3v3 in this game outside of using a stack. I don't like playing solo 3v3s, but I would play Trials if matchmaking was basically random solo 3v3.\n\nThat's the only way. Fuck Bungie and their engagement.

{"text": "I don\u2019t think bad gear is the problem, I think it\u2019s that your new and don\u2019t know what a load out should look like and what makes good weapons. \n\nA good load out tends to have a primary weapon, special weapon (uses green ammo) and a heavy weapon (uses purple ammo). Some people run 2. Special but this is very advanced so I\u2019d recommend to basically never do this but the important thing is 2 primary weapons is very bad, try to always run a special weapon.\n\nWeapons can perform one of two roles in game, killing lots of little things quickly (ad clear) or killing one big thing quickly (damage). 99.99% of primaries are ad clear so the reason you want to run a special is to normally have that weapon good at killing non boss big things like champions, non boss yellow bar enemies etc. heavies are usually used for damage where different heavy weapon types fit different scenarios except machine guns which are used for ad clear and are taken when you don\u2019t need to kill a boss.\n\nI\u2019ll quickly try to fill you in on perks now so you know what to look out for. I\u2019ll refer to 1st column and 2nd column perks, this being the 3rd and 4th column of your weapon as they are the perk slots. For all weapons the 1st perk tends to be a more stat/reload focused perk that doesn\u2019t normally effect damage but might allow you to reload faster. The 2nd perk column normally rolls damage perks and splash damage perks. A great primary can sometimes get damage perks in the first slot allowing you to run both perks that give splash damage and increased bullet damage but these are late endgame weapons.\nAs for primaries generally 1st column perks like rapid hit, feeding frenzy, rewind rounds etc are great as you either reload less or quicker allowing you to kill stuff quicker. Perks that give stats like dynamic sway or killing wind are more PvP focused as you don\u2019t care about laser beam stability for killing a thrall. For the 2nd column damage perks like kill clip, rampage, multikillclip, explosive payload compete with options like firefly, dragon fly, incandescent, volt shot, kinetic tremors that are splash damage or even have elemental synergies. For low light content I\u2019d recommend a splash perks over a damage perk but it\u2019s preference really.\n\nFor heavy weapons perks like bait and switch, explosive light are very good damage perks that are combined with perks like reconstruction, envious arsenal, envious assassin, auto loading holster if your a rocket or grenade launcher or fourth times the charm or rewind rounds if your a linear fusion. Swords like whirlwind blade and relentless strikes, always the god roll on a sword.\n\nFor specials the perk choices are similar to primaries so I\u2019ll quickly explain the what each special weapon does. Rocket side arms are for both ad clear and killing big guys, wave frame grenade launchers are for ad clear, regular grenade launchers are for killing large targets. Shot guns and snipers aren\u2019t popular options unless they are in the artefact but shot guns are killing big guys, snipers are actually used for boss dps some times and arnt normally run in non raid/dungeon content. Fusions are used for boss damage as well. Traces and glaibes arnt commonly used.\n\nI\u2019d recommend looking up a guy called aegis on YouTube, he makes the be all and end all tier lists to get more precise info on this and if you want and particular recommendations on weapons just ask", "label": 0}

So I hang out by the bank, the invader is bound to show up. They never seem to notice that I have zero motes. They just want to get *somebody*.
