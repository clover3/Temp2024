Maybe they can make it by summer but if they're in need of title fights later in the year they start pushing fights back. There's a chance it gets put on a slow track for a fight in abu dahbi or saudi arabia.\n\nThrowing ramadan into this makes it pretty hard for Nurmagomedov to get this fight next unless he sits out for a year essentially. Sure glad we have Omalley orbiting the title picture fucking things up while we have two amazing fighters we could match up. This is what happens when names skip the line.

{"text": "Yup, what Dana was really pissed about was GSP announcing his sorta retirement after the fight. Dana was ranting that GSP owed it to the UFC, Hendricks and the fans to have a rematch with Hendricks.       \nIt was crystal clear Dana wanted to do a rematch, which he hoped GSP would lose, and then he could promote the new Champion Hendricks. Now he had to make somebody else champ and people would question if they were better than GSP or not, hurting their legitimacy as the best lightweight.      \nDana/UFC really hate it when Champs leave while they're still the Champ. He gave GSP a 2nd chance in fighting Bisping under the belief/promise that he wouldn't retire again if he won the belt, but GSP did exactly that. That's why we never got GSP vs. Khabib, he didn't want to give GSP another payday and was probably terrified he'd win and retire a 3rd time.      \nIt's also a reason why the UFC had in their contracts an automatic extension if you were the champ.

Mma fighters have to devote their time to roughly four martial arts (boxing, muay thai/kickboxing, wrestling, and bjj) while submission grapplers put all of that same amount of time into just one martial art. Combine this with the fact that Dern hasn't been a world level grappler for many years (and is simply behind on the grappling meta in current bjj) and it's obviously no surprise Dern had 0 chance, and any former grappler world champ turned mma fighter would have similar chances in the same scenario as Dern.\n\nIt's the same reason even the best boxer in mma would be a MASSIVE underdog against any boxing world champ (in a boxing match, obviously).", "label": 0}
