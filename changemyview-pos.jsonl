I've been a feminist and generally fought for highly progressive views for as long as I've been interested. I'm bisexual and mixed race. I'm a European immigrant that grew up in the US. I've lived all over the country as well as obviously outside of it. I served in the military, and I generally agree with what you have to say. I don't think there is much highlighting of any positive examples of masculinity these days. There are plenty of great examples mind you, people that really exhibit what I think it means to be a mans man, but also a good man.  Not that you have to be that way, I certainly am not by all traditional metrics the most masculine person myself. And I'm fine with that.\n\nBut again, I totally agree that the left has failed men. I think society has failed young men in a lot of ways. And those failings are exactly what leads men into the arms of these misogynists like Peterson and Tate. You know, I sometimes joke that Jordan Peterson is my mortal enemy. Not because he's worse than that walking cum rag, Tate, but because I see where he's coming from, he does seem to see some of the real issues that plague young men. But his ideas, his solutions are just absolutely ridiculous, and ultimately, I actually don't think he even believes everything he says, I think he just thinks that it might be better for him and his if people did believe it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "It's funny. When I was a kid, the focus seemed to be moving past race and gender, and allowing people to be defined as individuals, instead of based on their colour or what was between their legs. It was a beautiful thought, and one that was a great goal for society.\n\nA couple of decades later, and the world now seems to be just as focused on race and gender as it ever was. All we did was replace one type of racism for another. Instead of being racist against women or people of colour, and blaming the world's problems on them, we now get to be racist against white men, and be racist against them, instead.\n\nWas the problem with racism really that we were directing it in the wrong direction?\n\nI don't really disagree with a lot of what you are saying, I just don't like the framing of the argument. I understand the reason for it, as that is how society has framed the argument in recent years, but I really think that the framing should be that we should be looking past race and gender, and judging people on their personal merits, as opposed to arguing over what label should be attached to one identifiable racial or gender group or another.\n\nThe reality is that no racial or gender group is a monolithic hivemind. For every white man through history who has caused problems, there has been a white man in opposition opposing his viewpoints. Some white men are really good leaders, while others are really bad ones. The same will apply with women, homosexuals, blacks, Asians, or any other group you want to name.\n\nYou won't solve racism with more racism.

He argues that asking someone to refer to you with different pronouns is \"the immature toddler\u2019s way of conceiving of and acting in the world.\"\n\nCertainly, it's impossible to categorize someone solely as \"right-wing\" or \"left-wing\" based on just a couple of views that they hold. One is allowed to agree with the right on certain issues and the left on others.

It suggests a fundamental shift within the Republican Party, where divisive narratives may become entrenched and future candidates might feel compelled to align with those ideas to gain support. This could have long-term repercussions on political discourse and the overall landscape of American democracy.\n\nMoving forward, it will be crucial for those who value unity and constructive dialogue to actively engage in countering these narratives and promoting a more inclusive vision for the future.

How did people ever give 144 delta's to you?\n\nI'll admit I worded this quote poorly. Or maybe my premisse is worded poorly as well.\n\nSo beauty products are in essence value perception. Using too many beauty products too often can seriously impact your health, let alone it's an industry based on perception which of course has huge environmental impact as well.\n\nNow let's assume you're some mid chick in the 80s that gets their boobs done and scores a well paying job or a well paid husband. This is where this whole thing goes dumb because we're all identity-conditioned, and why it seems to not make sense but still is if observed closely. The dumb part being the reactions I keep getting and the inability from commenters to look at it for what it, is even though I worded it poorly and can't change titles.\n\nSo you're pioneering for a technology that has no long-term known effects, but we know silicone tits in the 80s were terrible, and you still land a job or a guy that increases your benefit without any immediate harm. In 2024 you'd be a hazard to your self if you hadn't replaced those first generation tits with something technologically superior at this point. So the trade-off of experience over pure body benefit and harm come into play, and apparently our society was already as fucked as it was that it valued tits to make a career out of it that would generally improve your own benefit and lower harm. Even though you'd replace them a.s.a.p. come better technology and available money. Have you already noticed how fucked up society is?\n\nSo moving on, jewelry is expensive and in demand, as well as fake jewelry. This mostly falls in the identity category. Health benefit is hugely perception, there might be some health benefit to certain physical properties, but that's mostly in the realm of pseudo-science.\n\nHow does it relate? Fake jewelry that sells at the same price of the perceived value of jewelry, has a far lower production cost and thus higher profitability. At least when you buy an emerald you have an actual emerald, and don't have to worry about fake jewelry leaving all kinds of irritation or affecting your allergies.\n\nYou should know, it's complicated, more than you can apprehend apparently.", "label": 1}

Might want to check your names and timelines again. Even if you're referring to 2016 just because the DNC failed to support Bernie doesn't in any way make Harris a worse choice than Trump, it's actually completely irrelevant.\n\n3) How? How does the DNC have any influence over Israel, this is just a baseless claim unless you provide some sort of evidence..Again at face value this statement doesn't make any sense\n\n4) On what grounds are you calling the DNC evil and snakelike? Again you're just making a baseless characterization with no evidence to support your claim. \n\n5) Who are you referring to as \"the socialists\"? Do you even know what socialism means? If so, what is sub par about their policies as compared to others? Frankly those are questions that are hardly worth asking given that the phrasing of this claim also barely makes sense. Do you read the things you write before posting? \n\n6) Why are they better choices, without any evidence to support your claim this is a meaningless statement?\n\nOverall you barely made an effort to make a case for any of your claims so you're going to need to provide a clear avenue of what would actually change your view.

Wound up in a hospital for a few weeks after an outburst and was pumped full of meds. She was never the same after that. From there she became unable to walk and would scoot and sit on the floor, and within months was completely immobile, nonverbal, and wasting away in a chair all day. She spent a year or 2 like this. My dad took care of her the entire time, feeding her, changing her diaper, and bathing her. Things that she would have never wanted for herself.

So what is Kamala going to do if that happens?  She is going to start pushing a green agenda to try and win those vote back.  This is what makes the two party system so durable, but i also think its a feature of democracy, not a bug.  Voters should control what the candidates say and do, and voting third party effectively forces their hand.\n\nIts a great way to send a message!\n\nIf Kamala looses Oklahoma by a margined that is much narrower then expected, then that also sends a message.

{"text": "I think there is a lot more to this than just \"Ozempic\" is in low stock.\n\n1. There is more than one drug that does the same thing. Mounjaro (which my husband had better results on than Ozempic) is not currently approved for weight loss. He has had zero issues getting this drug.\n\n2. Saying all the drugs should ONLY be available to those with Type 2 Diabetes is a false argument when we know that MOST people with severe enough weight gain will EVENTUALLY get diabetes. So what you are saying is you AREN'T sick enough YET... get sicker. I am on Ozempic and was pre diabetic when I started. How close to diabetic do I need to be to be a good enough person to take it? Making me wait for this magic number opens my risks to other long-term risks like heart disease, etc that could have additional costs and even death.\n\n3. When we hold the \"supply\" issue as a reason for holding back treatment for people we are presupposing that the companies involved in this are all forthright and ethical actors. These are companies that are charging American over $900 for a med they charge less than $100 in other countries... Seems like this talk shortages is likely to their benefit. Tons of free advertising for them. Also... they are increasing supply so eventually it will not be an issue. Currently the FDA says it's available.\n\nSo we could discuss strategies that ensure that true diabetics have the drug (like keeping Mounjaro for their use only and not approving for weight loss) and forcing the drug companies to offer it at a price that is commensurate with the rest of the world. But no... people seem more likely to want to shame people who use it for weight loss rather let people who need it, and are at risk for serious health problems, get it because it violates some idea in their heads that people just need to do this on their own.\n\nI don't have time today to write a long story about my and my husband's experience with this drug set but beyond weight loss the positive effect on my life has been amazing. I will just briefly state that I gain weight in short spurts of high intense stress. Essentially high stress leads to intense hunger coupled with cravings for fat and sugar leads to overeating. Like having a large Ogre in my head screaming \"Bring me sugar and fat\" all day long. I have recently had some of the most stressful experiences in my life and not having this gnawing hunger during it helped with stress immensely. My husband always felt hungry, and also reports how this \"normal\" sensation of not being hungry has helped him. I have a good friend in the military, who only needed to lose a few pounds for her dress uniform, who also, her whole life has always felt hungry all the time. She was amazed when she went on it. This is what you fat shamers would consider still a \"good person\". She only gained the few pounds she did due to health issues.\n\nAll 3 of us described our experience to my friend's husband and he was shocked. When we describe the difference in our appetites and how we react to food he said, \"Wow what you are describing is just NORMAL for me.\" His relationship with food and his experience with it... is vastly different to ours. One big difference between his life and ours is that he grew up middle/upper class and my husband, my friend and I were all relatively poor. Our food as kids was mostly top ramen, box mac and cheese, etc. Not through choice through necessity.\n\nTL:DR I think that Ozempic and Wegovy should be used to help with weight loss as needed. Weight gain has a host of health risks and concerns that can be eliminated or reduced by losing weight. Holding back on solutions for purely judgmental reasons is not fair, as problems may have started before the person had the right or ability to make good food choices. We can, and should, protect the supply for true diabetics by limiting one or more of this UMBRELLA of drugs to diabetics. Also, we need to hold drug companies accountable for increasing supply and for fair pricing strategies.", "label": 1}

I'm not vegan.\n\nBUT, I do actually understand the point you're making and I kind of have to agree.\n\nThe reason people compare the two is because of this thing called \"leveling\" or \"false equivalence\" argument. Rather it's what you're seeing. As for why they are doing it? Likely to not have to internally deal with the ethical dilemma they are presented with. Perhaps a preference for the perception of \"peace\" and fairness over ethical behavior.\n\nYou have to remember that the default mode of human thought is to avoid discomfort. That's what this is about. It's intellectual laziness (or sometimes dishonesty.) Sometimes what is right and what is just might be uncomfortable to some and people are biased to loss aversion. In their minds, its \"unfair\" because it means they \"lose\" something (even though they really dont.) So it's also partially this factor.\n\nAgain, long way of saying that I understand the point you're making and agree. So if a vegan were inviting me to dinner at their house and was like \"I only cook vegan, and I am morally against preparing meat just for you\" I'd understand.

When summarizing someone\u2019s points, look for the most reasonable interpretation of their words.\n- Avoid moving the goalposts. Reread the claims in your OP or first comments and if you need to change to a new set of claims to continue arguing for your position, you might want to consider acknowledging the change in view with a [delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=changemyview&utm_content=t5_2w2s8) before proceeding.\n- Ask questions and really try to understand the other side, rather than trying to prove why they are wrong.\n\nPlease also take a moment to review our [Rule B](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_b) guidelines and _really_ ask yourself - am I exhibiting any of these behaviors?

Women are most often seen as victims (even when they\u2019re the perpetrators (less likely, but they get away more often or with lighter sentences).\n- And as you already found out, men are mostly unappreciated on the dating scene.

There are too many children stuck in foster care already. A fetus is essentially a parasite until it is viable on its own. There is no semblance of a brain until around the 3rd month. We have no way of telling if it will ever reach a point where it can survive on its own. Child birth can be fatal for the mother. There are just so many factors.

Perhaps the most comprehensive study was conducted 15 years ago, and found that in 2007 nearly three-quarters of surveyed crime laboratories in the United States reported that DNA analysis requests were completed within four months.\n\n>\tThe remaining laboratories required more than six to nine months to complete DNA analysis.\n\n>\tSome states release reports on TAT; for example, Wisconsin [\u2026] decreased from an average of 97 days in 2019 to 94 days in 2020.  \n\n>\tThe average TAT for biological testing in Maryland was 124 days in 2020 , the average TAT for DNA analysis in Delaware was 27.1 days in 2020 (34.7 in 2019) , and in Montana the average TAT [\u2026] was about 275 days (about 225 in 2019).\n\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44237/5", "label": 1}

{"text": "> *\"Islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women\u2019s freedom.\"*\n\nIslamic scripture and hadiths openly prescribe a rigid, deeply controlling system for women\u2019s roles and rights. Take, for instance, **Qur'an 4:34**, which grants husbands authority over their wives, allowing them to *\"admonish, forsake them in bed, and strike them\"* if they fear disobedience. This verse has been cited repeatedly in Islamic jurisprudence to justify men\u2019s \"right\" to discipline their wives, creating a dangerous precedent that is frequently echoed in conservative Muslim-majority countries, where domestic abuse is systematically underreported and legal protections for women remain grossly inadequate.\n\nIslamic law in various countries limits women\u2019s rights regarding divorce, inheritance, and child custody. For instance, a woman\u2019s testimony in legal proceedings is considered half as valuable as a man\u2019s, based on **Qur'an 2:282**. Moreover, **Qur'an 4:11** assigns women half the inheritance of male counterparts. This embedded inequality is not a relic of ancient societies; it is a doctrinal reality that remains enforced in contemporary Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nConsider the case of Saudi Arabia, which until very recently mandated male guardianship over women. Even today, women face limitations in the legal system due to this guardianship, and the modest freedoms they now enjoy come only after international outcry. The \u201cmodesty\u201d codes, whether in Iran, Afghanistan, or other Sharia-based societies, subject women to harassment, violence, and prison time for failing to adhere to religious dress codes. The recent crackdown on women in Iran, who dared remove their hijabs in defiance, is a stark reminder of this misogyny's persistence and institutional strength.\n\n> *\"It teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates.\"*\n\nIslamic doctrine does not merely disapprove of homosexuality; it mandates punishment. **Sahih Bukhari 5886** and other hadiths express condemnation of homosexual acts, often endorsing severe penalties, including death. Traditional Islamic jurisprudence\u2014whether Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi\u2019i, or Maliki\u2014prescribes brutal punishments for homosexual acts, a reality that plays out in the criminal codes of countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Afghanistan, where LGBTQ+ people live in constant fear of imprisonment, flogging, or execution.\n\nThe fate of apostates is equally grim. **Sahih Bukhari 6922** states, *\"Whoever changes his Islamic religion, kill him.\"* Apostasy is considered a capital offense in traditional Islamic law. In countries that strictly follow Sharia, like Iran, Sudan, and parts of Pakistan, apostasy can lead to death sentences or life imprisonment. Even in nations where apostasy isn\u2019t punishable by death, social consequences are severe; families often disown or even harm apostates. Such harsh punishments for dissenting beliefs are a powerful deterrent to free thought and an open society, and they directly challenge the claim that Islam respects personal freedom.\n\n> *\"It encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy.\"*\n\nThe Qur'an contains multiple verses that explicitly call for violence against non-believers. **Qur'an 9:5** says, *\"Kill the polytheists wherever you find them,\"* and **Qur'an 9:29** instructs Muslims to *\"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day.\"* The so-called \u201cSword Verses\u201d of the Qur'an lay out a theology that endorses violence to expand Islamic authority. \n\nThe hadiths further enforce this militant outlook. In **Sahih Muslim 1731**, Muhammad is reported to have said, *\u201cI have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\u201d* This has inspired centuries of military campaigns under the banner of jihad, a concept rooted not just in spiritual struggle but often in warfare for Islam\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis doctrine finds expression in radical groups but also in mainstream rhetoric within conservative Islamic societies. The glorification of \u201cmartyrdom\u201d is not limited to fringe elements; it is celebrated in various communities as an ideal. From Palestinian territories to parts of Pakistan, martyrdom in the cause of Islam is glorified, and children are often raised with stories of those who \"died for Islam.\"\n\n> *\"The goal of Islam, as stated in its texts, is to dominate the world as the true religion.\"*\n\nIslamic doctrine contains a universalist element that insists on Islam's ultimate dominance. **Qur'an 3:85** states, *\"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\"* This, paired with **Qur'an 48:28**\u2014which speaks of Allah sending Muhammad with the *\u201creligion of truth to prevail over all religions\u201d*\u2014underscores Islam\u2019s supremacist outlook. \n\nThe idea of eventual Islamic dominance is not relegated to historical wishful thinking; it\u2019s embedded in modern Islamist ideology, which seeks to impose Sharia law across nations. Groups advocating for Sharia law, from the Taliban to Boko Haram, derive their missions directly from Islamic doctrine. Additionally, Islamic organizations within democratic countries, including Western Europe and North America, often campaign for separate religious courts or allowances that align civil law with Sharia, showing a clear commitment to extending Islamic jurisprudence even within secular states.\n\n> *\u201cWith these factors in mind, I think a critical view or even fear of Islam isn\u2019t irrational.\u201d*\n\nGiven the scriptural, doctrinal, and real-world evidence, a critical view of Islam is not only rational but perhaps necessary. History and data reinforce that where Islam holds sway, human rights for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and religious minorities suffer enormously. Consider global gender equality indices or the prevalence of blasphemy and apostasy laws in Islamic countries. These outcomes are not accidents but direct products of Islamic jurisprudence. From forced veiling in Iran to the persecution of non-Muslims in Pakistan, the real-world consequences of Islamic doctrines are too pervasive and too consistent to ignore.\n\nIn Western nations, where values of freedom, equality, and secularism are foundational, it's not irrational to be wary of ideologies fundamentally incompatible with these principles. This isn't fear born of prejudice; it\u2019s a response to clear ideological and legal principles that prioritize religious supremacy over universal human rights. \n\nTo dismiss this as \u201cIslamophobia\u201d is a rhetorical trap meant to silence valid critique. Just as skepticism of authoritarianism isn\u2019t \u201cdictator-phobia,\u201d questioning Islamic doctrine is a necessary, logical response to protect values of freedom, equality, and human dignity.", "label": 1}

{"text": "As a person who lived most of his life in a Muslim-majority country, I totally agree with you. Peaceful moderate Muslims are okay, all Muslims aren't hateful. But those(Islamists) who want to install Shariah, impose their laws on others, and support forming a Caliphate deserve hate, and people should hate them. Because they support or love a system or cult that allows them to do many inhumane things. For example - Maybe every Islamist won't marry a 13 y/o, but you can't say anything against those who will do it either. Because Islamic Shariah allows it, and talking about anything against halal is punishable in a properly Shariah-installed Islamic state. So, the Muslims who have intentions or dreams to impose that shariah, even a little in their mind deserve to be hated. Infrastructure development is different from social and human rights. There are many Muslim countries, and If you want to talk about mostly Human Rights, the more secular and far away from Islam the country is, the better the situation. The more secular and liberal a Muslim person is, the better and less harmful he is. But the interesting thing is that practicing Muslims don't like these countries and Muslims Most Muslims don't like them. If you are a Proper Muslim, you have to be against these. Because according to Islam, those who believe in a man-made system, ie democracy instead of the laws of Allah aren't Muslim anymore.\n\nI get why the far-leftists, and ultra-libs support and love them so much! They don't realize the threat of political Islam and Islamists yet. Islamists are the masters of re-interpretation. Most of the preachers and practicing Islamists in the West hide many controversial things about Shariah when preaching to the dumb woke people. Brainwashing them is so easy. If the Islamists didn't hide or sugarcoat the controversial laws, the number of people who accepted Islam in the West wouldn't even be half of today. It's a fact. So I would suggest the libs ... be good to the peaceful moderate educated Muslims. Keep talking about the genocide taking place in Gaza. But try to know who is the Islamist, and who will want to behead you when they are the majority. If you want to know about Islam and Islamists, ask the ex-Muslims. Not the Islamists. And If you don't want to do it, that's okay too! Keep creating the space for Political Islam. Time will say everything. REMEMBER, it's just not about some Muslims or some Muslim countries. It's Islam and the Shariah itself. Other religions have these kinds of laws too, but they don't want to enforce them anymore. Meanwhile, most Muslims love Shariah and have the instinct to install that. So, don't let the Islamists here and irl fool you. If you don't learn from history, no one can save you.\n\nI know it sounds harsh, and both \"Western Left\" and Muslims won't like it maybe. But this is what it is.

{"text": ">Notably, Judaism doesn\u2019t try to limit what you can do at all. If you read the Talmud, Jewish restrictions are for Jews only, as they serve primarily to make their nation distinct.\n\nSorry, but this is actually worse when you look at what the distinction is. Your comment implies that the Jews are a nation of love and peace and that their Scripture reflects as much, wishing to be left alone.\n\nIn reality, Jewish exceptionalism and insularity is used to be able to exploit and subvert gentiles whilst keeping themselves safe. Think of it like the immune system, it needs to be able to destroy everything foreign whilst recognising and collaborating with cells from the same organism.\n\nHere are just some Jewish beliefs from the Talmud:\n\n- Jews believe they are the superior race chosen by God.\n\n- Jews believe in world domination and enslaving the gentiles, and that each Jew will receive 27 slaves (number may be different)\n\n- Jews believe they can rape, rob, and exploit gentiles with no divine or legal repercussions.\n\n- Jews believe, for example, that if a Jew rapes a woman, the woman should be put to death for enticing him.\n\nDoes this sound like a nation wishing to be left alone in peace and keep to itself? Or a nation hellbent on world domination of the inferior majority through dogmatic cult behaviour?\n\nCould this explain why criticism of Jews is pretty much deemed unacceptable? Christians and Muslims have billions of members who have been killing each other for a thousand years. It's hard for either side to claim ultimate victim hood. Jews on the other engage in much worse behaviour, and they have been thrown out of 109 different countries as a result. But due to their non proselytising and insular behaviour, they are good at feigning victimhood.", "label": 1}

I think Islam is crock bullshit. Same for religion. I believe in the right of religious freedom but I don't respect religion. I respect your faith to believe in it, but I look down on the church and the act of dedicating your life to it.\n\nI think OP you have the problem of judging a person based on the demographic. I'm not talking about bigotry specifically, but the assumption lfet wingers are stuck in the mindset they cannot criticize other cultures.\n\nThe truth is, they're choosing not to instigate a controversial topic. I have no problem talking about controversial topics. But I don't want to. And I hate it when people just bring these topics up for shits n giggle. Most people don't want to debate heated controversial political topics at the spur of the moment. People who tend to bring these topic up often are instigators and almost always tend to be political extremist trying to rile up the opposition.\n\nTake for example someone who can't stfu about immigration or LGBT.

{"text": "At a fundamental level, this opinion confuses the perspective on the Left.\n\nThe Left tends to have a strong anti-Imperialist bent, which they read as a Western act (ignoring Non-Western forms of Imperialism) and that bent often manifests in an ideological defense of Non-Western states, especially those operating either without Western assistance or in direct defiance of Western demands. This is a support of those countries and their choices, which indirectly supports the elements in power in those Non-Western states. In some cases, like Iran, this results in an indirect (and perhaps unintentional) support for traditionalist reactionaries and in other cases, like PR China, this results in an indirect support for entrenched social revolutionaries who actually have Leftist ideals. However, the Leftist is not supporting the particular result of any power structure in a Non-Western state; they are supporting localized self-empowerment. It could be traditional, non-traditional, or explicitly anti-traditional.\n\nThe problems I would argue with the Left is that they fail to recognize that their support of the elements of power in Non-Western states, especially those operating either without Western assistance or in direct defiance of Western demands, are (1) that this often leads to a support of autocracies that violate the very rights that the Left argues are critical in their homelands (freedoms of expression, rights to vote, gender/ethnic/religious equality, etc.) and (2) it fundamentally ignores that many Non-Western countries, by their own agency, have decided to align with the West because of the governance and economy that the West can offer and assert that these relationships are imposed by the West rather than freely chosen.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Despite what his detractors like to state, he's not responsible for Covid. Prior to covid, he actually did a fairly good job. The only knock on him was his excessive spending. \n\nIn particular, Trump was good in international relations. I'll use Iran as a clear example of this. Obama's biggest blunder in international relations was to treat Iran as a responsible nation and part of the global order. This gave Iran access to greater resources, which it used to fund proxies all over the Middle East, such as ISIS. Trump economically isolated Iran to such a degree that it had less than a billion in foreign reserves by the time he left office; this lack of resources led to a drastic decrease in terrorist activity in the last couple of years that he was in office. \n\nBy siding so strongly against Iran, SA and its faction in the Middle East became significantly friendlier with America, leading to the Abraham Accords. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham\\_Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Accords) If Biden had continued Trump's Middle East policies, there would now be an economic and political alliance between the major Arab powers and Israel. There would be no funding for Iran's proxies (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, etc.).\n\nYou can also look at Trump's tariffs. Despite his rhetoric while campaigning, Biden's administration not only kept them in place, but modestly expanded upon them. And, despite his campaign rhetoric, Trump did not put blanket tariffs in place, but enacted reasonable targeted tariffs. Yes, it instigated a trade war, but one that America handedly won. China's ponzi economy is incredibly unstable and now has lower growth than America. \n\nOther than tariffs, Trump's next 2 primary economic policies that he's been touting the most over the last month has been energy subsidies and not taxing overtime. Both of these are actually surprisingly good policies. Energy is the base for the entire economy. Creating cheaper energy means the cost of basically everything will go down. While not discussed nearly as much as oil, he has also talked about nuclear power, which we definitely need to invest heavily into. \n\nThe no tax on overtime, if implemented in a way to not allow abuse, is actually quite brilliant. It will give incentive for people to work more. More output means an increase in the supply of goods and services, which puts a downward pressure on real costs. Further, it gives greater reward to those working the most, and thereby increasing real demand. An increase in both the supply and demand is literally what economic growth is.\n\nMy primary concern with Trump's presidency is spending, but it's not like Harris wasn't going to be spending like crazy either.\n\nTrump's previous presidency was chaotic, but that was mostly politically and not related to his policies.", "label": 1}

January 6th, when he told his supporters to \"peacefully make your voices heard\"? When he twice suggested to Pelosi to have national guard ready?\n\nSome of what you are saying is too incoherent for me to respond to.\n\nThe Supreme Court recognized presidential immunity. This is not unprecedented, but something that judges and members of congress also enjoy. \n\nThe NY Judge delayed his sentencing because he is going to have to toss the charges at sentencing because of the immunity ruling, and doing so would mean they can't call Trump a convicted felon any more. The judge was openly hostile to Trump.\n\nTrump is winning the popular vote, so your ignorant argument about the electoral college is also irrelevant.\n\nFinally, it is the people, not you alone, who determine who our next president will be.

{"text": "Let\u2019s distinguish between bodily autonomy and financial autonomy. Financial autonomy is about independence in economic matters, while bodily autonomy is about independence over one's physical body and health decisions. Both are considered critical to individual freedom and self-determination, but they apply to different aspects of life. The issue of abortion is rooted in an individual\u2019s right to control their own body\u2014deciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term is a deeply personal choice with significant implications for one\u2019s health and well-being. Financial obligations, while impactful, do not directly affect the body in the same way.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to recognize that financial obligations don\u2019t always require physically taxing labor. While many people do work for their money, others may receive it through inheritance, universal credit, or even lottery winnings. Even if a person depends on their job, it\u2019s not guaranteed to cause long-term physical harm to their body. If the work becomes harmful, the individual can quit the job and potentially rely on benefits\u2014something that would allow them to maintain financial stability without enduring physical harm.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in the U.K., where both the original poster and I are from, maintenance payments are adjusted according to income, providing a degree of financial autonomy while minimizing the risk of physical hardship. If a job is harming someone, they can leave, and the maintenance will be reduced to around \u00a37/week while they are on benefits. This is far from ideal but still represents a flexibility that doesn\u2019t result in permanent or life-altering physical changes, as is the case with pregnancy.\n\nUltimately, while financial responsibility is a serious issue, it doesn't violate bodily autonomy in the same way pregnancy or abortion does. The ability to quit a job or adjust one\u2019s income to minimize harm to the body highlights that financial obligations, even when burdensome, are fundamentally different from the profound, irreversible physical consequences of pregnancy.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Tyson\u2019s boxing skills and peekaboo style are elite within boxing, but MMA and kickboxing demand very different skills to succeed. MMA, in particular, requires proficiency in both striking and grappling, along with ground control. \n\nWhile Tyson\u2019s quick backsteps and counters might avoid takedowns initially, skilled grapplers\u2014who often train chain-wrestling to persist through counters\u2014would eventually take him down. \n\nIn the clinch, MMA fighters rely on knees, takedowns, and submissions, which Tyson\u2019s boxing background doesn\u2019t prepare him for. Defensively, his boxing footwork excels within boxing range, but the wider ranges and leg attacks in MMA and kickboxing create vulnerability to leg and head kicks. \n\nTyson\u2019s movements, designed to close distances for punching, could leave him exposed against kickboxers\u2019 long-range attacks without specific training for checking and defending kicks. Tyson would also face serious risks in grappling exchanges; the clinch, for example, often leads to ground scenarios where his lack of grappling skills would make him susceptible to takedowns and submissions.\n\n High-level MMA fighters today cross-train extensively, with wrestlers adding striking skills and strikers working on takedown defense to become well-rounded. Tyson\u2019s one-dimensional boxing background, though effective in boxing, would leave him exposed without significant cross-training. While cases like James Toney and Ray Mercer are often explained by age or conditioning, they also reveal the difficulty boxers face without cross-training when adjusting to MMA\u2019s multidimensional threats. \n\nAdditionally, boxing conditioning doesn\u2019t equip fighters for the grappling endurance required in MMA; if Tyson is tired on the ground, he\u2019d be highly vulnerable to being controlled or submitted. Tyson\u2019s strength, speed, and explosiveness would make him a formidable opponent in brief, standing exchanges, but without focused training, MMA\u2019s varied demands would likely expose gaps in his game at the highest levels.", "label": 1}
