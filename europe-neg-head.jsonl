You are somehow upset that things were renegotiated **IN YOUR FAVOR**, which is a Russian talking point if I've ever heard one. In fact it is so pants-on-head blindingly idiotic that you basically *HAVE* to be a Russian. :)\n\n>I am interested to know given that I formed my fundamental opinions about the EU at a time when it was called the EEC, and the Soviet Union was in favor of it, thinking it would be a useful wedge between the USA and western Europe.\n\nAnd the Russians were wrong about the level of control they could exert over the EU. The only people upset about that are the Russians, sweetheart. :D\n\n>Your \"Russian talking point\" shtick is just a cheap cop-out to dismiss arguments you find uncomfortable but can't be arsed to actually argue against.\n\nWrong.\n\nI'm confused as to why you are upset that things were resolved A) Peacefully and B) **IN YOUR FAVOR**. And rather than even try to answer that you decided to ignore EVERYTHING else and concentrate on the fact I am calling out your obvious Russian propaganda.\n\nSee, sweetheart, if you were actually from Denmark, or if you were actually interested (or even knowledgeable) in the points you claim to be so important, you would have focused on them, instead you flew right off the handle at the mention of the word \"Russian\"... Just like a Russian would. :D\n\n>We are still interested in democracy, yes?\n\nI mean, you very clearly aren't. The EU is the envy of the world as a pillar of the power of democracy and compromise. But to hear you tell it, they're worse than North Korea.\n\nSo, no, I don't think you are interested in democracy at all.", "label": 0}

And, the overwhelming majority was in favor of \u00a0nuclear exit - Merkel just reacted to that. It would have even been nearly completely ok, if the government didn't kill the renewable at the same time. The gas dependency was discussed and criticized ironically by our current Economic Minister Habeck from the green party.\n\u00a0\nBut what clearly shows the irrelevance of nuclear vs gas is: Germanys usage of gas for electricity was/is rather small.\n\nPeak nuclear was 2000-2006 (around 170TWh), Peak Gas 2020 around 90TWh.\u00a0Renewables: 90TWh in 2007, 170TWh in 2015, and by 2022 we were around 260TWh renewables.\u00a0If you look at CO2 (and pollution), than it's absolutely fine to complain about Nuclear exit before coal.\u00a0\nWe used \u00a0by far the most gas for heating ( another part for the chemical industry). And that was more or less irrelevant to nuclear energy or not. (But obviously not to the high prices).\nThats what also your linked paper (in hindsight) got wrong, natural gas is nearly on the same level as 2008.\u00a0\n>Germany\u2019s decision to be free of nuclear power by 202324\u00a0will greatly increase its reliance on hydrocarbons to generate electricity over the coming decade, in particular natural gas.\nSee here:\u00a0https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_image/public/paragraphs/images/fig2a-gross-power-production-germany-1990-2023-source.png?itok=x1IW2WRw", "label": 0}

Senior EU officials are holding daily meetings to outline where a Trump presidency could cause the most pain for the bloc, said people familiar with the talks. They said topics under discussion included how to withstand a barrage of trade tariffs, offset an end to US aid to Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia if Washington lifts its restrictions. \u201cEveryone is taking everything much more seriously,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. \u201cWe are trying to make sure we will not be taken by surprise.\u201d \n\nThe preparations include formal talks between EU ambassadors and the staff of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, as well as informal groups of senior EU diplomats considering possible strategies. Trump has vowed to impose flat 10 per cent tariffs on all imports and is critical of US support for Kyiv and sceptical of Nato, which underpins Europe\u2019s defence. \n\nPolling suggests he is in a dead heat against vice-president Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election, and has overtaken his Democratic rival as the candidate Americans trust most with the economy, according to a Financial Times poll released this week. \u201cIn my personal point of view, we will be in trouble. Deep trouble,\u201d another EU diplomat said of a Trump win. \u201cThis disruptive element will be huge, and the unpredictability will be huge.\u201d\n\n  \nCharles Michel, the European Council president who represents EU member states, told the FT that a Trump victory would lead to \u201cimmediate decisions\u201d by the new US administration \u201cthat would have an immediate impact, a huge impact in the short term in Europe, for sure\u201d. Michel added: \u201cIf it is Trump, it would be an additional wake-up call that we need to act more to take our destiny in our own hands.\u201d  \n  \nOfficials fear Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs could reduce EU exports to the US by about \u20ac150bn a year. The commission, which manages trade policy, has already drafted a strategy to offer Trump a quick deal on increasing US imports to the EU and only resort to targeted retaliation if he opts for punitive tariffs. Goldman Sachs forecast this week that the euro could fall by as much as 10 per cent against the dollar if Trump were to impose widespread tariffs and slash domestic taxes, while a study by the German Economic Institute in Cologne said a trade war could lower the GDP of the EU\u2019s biggest economy by 1.5 per cent.  \n  \nThe biggest short-term security concern of EU officials is how to continue support to Ukraine if Trump cuts off a flow of weapons that has played a vital role in helping Kyiv thwart Russia\u2019s invasion. The EU has provided more financial support to Ukraine than the US. But American weapons stockpiles and capabilities are far larger than European countries\u2019. Officials briefed on the discussions say there is no possibility EU militaries could match what the US is providing. Officials in the bloc are also deeply concerned that a Trump administration would lift sanctions on Russia. That would raise the question of how much economic pressure the EU could maintain on Moscow without US support, even if Japan, the UK and other allies kept sanctions in place. Trump\u2019s scepticism towards Nato has also exacerbated long-running fears about European reliance on US security guarantees.  \n  \n\u201cRight now we are arguing amongst ourselves about how to raise \u20ac100bn for defence and whether we really need to,\u201d said another EU diplomat, referring to the bloc\u2019s debate about a joint debt issue. \u201cIf Trump wins, we\u2019ll instead be talking about \u20ac1tn and it won\u2019t be optional.\u201d The EU talks to prepare for a possible Trump return to the White House have intensified over the past month. They follow von der Leyen\u2019s decision this year to form a small in-house war room to prepare for the US election result, focused mainly on trade and security issues.  \n  \nNato officials are also brainstorming on how to minimise potential disruption and \u201cTrump-proof\u201d as much Ukraine support as possible. One option would be to give the 32-nation alliance a greater say in co-ordinating weapons supply and the training of Ukrainian troops to reduce US direct control over both issues. The alliance\u2019s new secretary-general Mark Rutte, who maintained good relations with Trump during the former president\u2019s first term, said last week that Nato \u201cwill not lose\u201d its unity on Ukraine. But Michel said there was no guarantee that Harris would maintain existing US policy towards Ukraine, arguing that both candidates would probably identify the US economy as their key priority. \u201cMaybe the tone will be more polite, in one case, less polite in another, more brutal in one case, less brutal in another,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is there is a protectionist trend in the United States.\u201d", "label": 0}

You buy a piece of paper for a certain amount of money \n* the government gets the money and after the bond maturation period (a set amount of time) \n* the government pays back the costs of the bond, but on top of this all you get a periodic income of a percentage of the bond price (the Yield). \n\nThe amount of money the government has to pay over the bond period, or the yield, indicates the trust people have in the government paying the bond back. In developed and stable economies, 20 year bonds can have a yield of 2-5 percent. This can be a very stable form of income over large periods. Now for Russia the bond yield for 20 years is 16% and climbing FAST.

{"text": "> You have to be ABSOLUTELY delusional to think that.\n\nIt's straightforward fact. You have nothing to dispute it with. \n\nWhat you don't understand is that \"more regulation\" or \"more bans\" does not equate to better quality or safety. e.g., the EU has very onerous GMO restrictions and bans in place, however anti-GMO regulation is almost entirely pseudo-science cooked up by poorly educated European football moms. If you ban something that's not dangerous, you're not making someone safer. \n\nThe US on the other hand has extremely practical and very serious food regulations, it bans many practices, ingredients, etc. from Europe. I don't hear you going on about them. \n\n> The US allows hormone-filled beef,\n\nScare words of no meaning or substance. \n\nThat's like saying \"the US allows grass-fed beef\". Totally innocuous. \n\n> pork that is banned\n\nMeat products all over the world are banned for all kinds of (mostly protectionist) reasons. Pork in particular gets the hammer very frequently. It's also banned for import due to reasons like religious issues.\n\nThe US for example bans Iberico ham. \n\nUS food safety and quality is still superior to all of Europe. \n\n> sooooo many things are ultra-processed and even basic stuff like bread has a billion additives\n\nAgain, scare words. \n\nPepperoni is an ultra-processed food, I don't see you arguing to string up Italians for crimes against food safety. Nonsensically banning innocuous things because the latest health fad has made them into a scare word does not actually improve food safety or quality. \n\nThere are endless forms of bread available in the US, you don't know shit to generalize. \"Additives\" is also a meaningless word. All ingredients are additives. European food has just as many. \n\n> one of them being asthma attack-inducing yoga mat material that is banned in the EU even in the mentioned yoga mats because mere skin contact caused asthma attacks\n\nHave you been eating your yoga mat? That might explain your nonsensical takes on food.\n\n> while EU foods have much less and just simple ingredients.\n\nNo they don't. That's dumb dumb false EU superiority complex.\n\nDid you know that the US has FAR MORE strict regulations and requirements for ingredient disclosure?\n\nFor example, one common ingredient in the US is required to state \"Enriched Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Ferrous Sulfate (Iron), Thiamin Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Folic Acid)\"\n\nScary right? Look at all those big words you don't understand. \n\nWell weaker regulations in Europe and elsewhere would list the EXACT SAME ingredient as \"From Wheat\". \n\n>  The US has corn starch and sugar basically everywhere, even where they they shouldn't be.\n\nLol, you have such a delusional understanding of the US. \n\nFirst of all, what do either of these have to do with food quality or safety? Are you saying the EU should ban sugar?\n\nSecond, where should they not be, lol?\n\n> US eggs have a 100 times higher chance to be infected by salmonella \n\nLol, you can't just make up fake numbers to support your shitty points. \n\n> han EU eggs because US regulations demand them to be cleaned, which makes the shell weaker at protecting against diseases and water,\n\nThis is false. \n\nUS egg washing requirements are safer, period. It's an example of a STRICTER US food regulation. It does improve the safety of eggs, unwashed eggs literally just have the bird poop and salmonella directly on them - you have to handle them and wash them yourselves while avoiding cross contamination. Far riskier. \n\n> chicken is also similar, especially since it's bathed in poop water and bleach in the US. \n\nThis is false. \n\nIt's not bleach. The US washes chicken with chlorine. And again, this is another example of a STRICTER US food regulation that directly improves the safety of your food. Europe does the same with vegetables. Are you saying it's not safe / OK when the US washes food with chlorine, but it is safe / OK when Europe does? You're so ignorant. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47440562\n\n> So many things contain dried milk instead of proper one. \n\nWhat things specifically?\n\n> Not even starting with all the things that farmers are allowed to spray their plants with.\n\nLike chlorine? The same thing European farmers spray their plants with?\n\n> US regulations just push the responsibility of not being poisoned on the consumer to prepare the food properly.\n\nNo, they're actually superior at ensuring the safety and quality of US food, and in many cases they're stricter (not dumb strict like EU regulations, but strict as in improving safety strict). \n\n> EU's regulations are good enough for Tatar steak to be safe.\n\nYou're aware that steak tartare is a common dish in the United States, right?", "label": 0}

There\u2019s more services and goods than before, sure. GDP is higher but where it matters, purchasing power is lower\n\nAh, PPP disposable income, an extremely misleading statistic. Let\u2019s break it down. \n\nFirst, PPP is not cost of living. It\u2019s how far that money goes in that economy on a macro level. That\u2019s why costs of construction and bureaucracy are involved in the calculation. \n\nGermanys PPP is rated at 1.25 euros to 1 dollar\u2026  meaning 1.25\u20ac in Germany. give you the same purchasing power as $1 in the US. that\u2019s not cost of living, not even close. \n\nAlready there\u2019s a 30% advantage to the US which is just not accurate. \n\nSecond of all, the \u201csocial transfers in kind\u201d are not measured in any equal way. \n\nWhy would we not measure average wage instead?\nAverage wage in Germany is 50k\u20ac(54k USD).

All of those other things you need to pay for in the US. \n\nNot to mention you need two cars in the US for a family, and associated costs like insurance. \n\nIn Germany you don\u2019t, public transportation is good and cheap. \n\nHealthcare alone will eat up the difference.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the claims:\n\nMember of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PSP):\nThis is true. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is indeed a long-time member of the Portuguese Socialist Party, a center-left political party.\n\nSupportive of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro:\nThere is no concrete evidence that the Portuguese Socialist Party is \"mainly supportive\" of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Venezuelan leader. The PSP generally aligns with social-democratic and center-left values in Europe, which do not mirror Maduro's regime. Guterres himself, during his tenure at the UN, has had to take a diplomatic stance, calling for negotiations in Venezuela rather than overtly supporting any one side.\n\nChatGPT buddy.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The Creators\n\nThe Ozarichi concentration camp was created on March 10, 1944, by order of the commander of the 9th Army, General Josef Harpe (who was captured by the Americans and lived to the age of 80). It consisted of three camps set up along the front line.\n\nThe area was entirely marshland and sparse woods.\n\nThe first camp was located near the village of Dert. It was established by the 35th Wehrmacht Division under the command of Lieutenant General Georg Richert.\n\nThe second camp was near the settlement of Ozarichi.\n\nThe third was close to the village of Podosinnik. The camps in Podosinnik and Ozarichi were organized by the 110th Wehrmacht Division under the command of Lieutenant General von Kurowski.\n\n=Lieutenant General von Kurowski was sentenced to 25 years in prison=\n\nHell\n\nThe territory was surrounded by barbed wire. The perimeter was mined. The surrounding area was entirely marshland. There were hardly any trees. There was no drinking water. There was no food. There were very few dry spots that were not waterlogged.\n\nThere were fifty thousand women and children \u2014 prisoners of the Ozarichi concentration camp.\n\nSince most of the prisoners were intended to survive until our army arrived, in order to infect Russian soldiers with typhus, they were fed bread made of sawdust and oatmeal flour.\n\nThis \"bread\" was thrown over the barbed wire rather than brought in, to avoid infection.
