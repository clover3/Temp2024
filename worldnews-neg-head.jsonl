Or put another way they are so threatened by events that they decide this is the way to go. Of course that is one way to do it. If NATO felt threatened they could just enter the war if they all agreed as well. Before someone starts the \"they haven't attacked NATO yada yada bit\", an attack is in part a political decision. Drones hitting NATO can be used as justification if the countries desired to do so. Or they can not be used that way. But at the present time the perceived threat to NATO appears to be such that neither of these options is desirable at the moment. That could change, but I am not saying it will or is even likely that will change. But if somehow things aligned in the minds of each NATO member that a course of action should be taken they do have these options. But admittedly that would need to be a remarkable political alignment of minds so practically speaking you are right. I mention this last point because I don't want to appear argumentative, not my intent.\n\nBut I can think of scenarios where one of the two options above results in NATO action. A nuclear strike in Ukraine with radiation wafting into NATO territory is one that has been openly mentioned by NATO states as justification for action. Although in that case option 2 would happen, military intervention. Following that Ukraine would end up in NATO most certainly.", "label": 0}

If your neighbor used your house against your will for 22 years, you wouldn't just pretend that they were a fantastic neighbor after they announce that they will stop using your house against your will. Nor would you just ignore them and pretend that they won't do that again. It is human nature to then live in fear of that and prepare accordingly. The problem is that Hezbollah used that fear  on the Shia Lebanese who lived near the southern border to garner control of their vote and to continue to rise to power, and use that power to become the political party running Lebanon, directly and indirectly, and causing a multitude of issues in Lebanon domestically (how can you have an army when there is a political party who is the militia?, or how can you invest in the economy, when a political party controls the access to ports, airport, and some of the neighboring countries.  \n\nMy Lebanese friends love when they see people defending Israel who has been the only foreign entity to enter and attack Lebanese soil over the last 2 decades.", "label": 0}

If you look at polls taken of the American public prior to Pearl Harbor, by late 1940 the majority supported intervention:\n\n\"In January of that year(1940), one poll found that 88% of Americans opposed the idea of declaring war against the Axis powers in Europe. As late as June, only 35% of Americans believed their government should risk war to help the British. Soon after, however, France fell, and in August the German\u00a0**Luftwaffe**\u00a0began an all-out bombing campaign against Great Britain. The British Royal Air Force valiantly repelled the German onslaught, showing that Hitler was not invincible. A September 1940 poll found that 52% of Americans now believed the United States ought to risk war to help the British. That number only increased as Britain continued its standoff with the Germans; by April 1941 polls showed that 68% of Americans favored war against the Axis powers if that was the only way to defeat them.\"\n\n[https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/great-debate](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/great-debate)\n\nThe public had moved away from isolationism before Pearl Harbor.", "label": 0}
