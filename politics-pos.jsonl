They\u2019re counting on our ignorance, but we just can\u2019t plead ignorance any longer. \n\nHere you go: \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all connected. It goes to principles and platforms, NOT personalities.

IF YOU HAD A HUNCH THE NEWS MEDIA WAS SOMEWHAT RIGGED AND YOU COULDN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT, THIS MIGHT HELP YOU SOLVE THE PUZZLE.  \n\nNow you know why no one is investigated.They all have their hands in the cookie jar!  \n\nYou might remember James Comey who investigated the Clinton email scandal and the Clinton Foundation, and made the final decision to not recommend prosecution by the DOJ. \nIt turns out that the Clinton Foundation was audited by the law firm DLA Piper. One of the executives there was in charge of the Clinton Foundation audit. Who was it? Peter Comey, James Comey\u2019s brother. \n\nPeter Comey held an executive position with the Washington law firm that did the audit of the Clinton foundation in 2015.   \n\nPeter Comey was officially DLA Piper \u201cSenior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas,\u201d in 2015 when the Clinton Foundation scandals first broke and Hillary was preparing her Presidential campaign.   Not only was DLA Piper, the firm where Comey\u2019s brother worked involved in the audit of the Clinton Foundation, but according to the foundation\u2019s donor records, DLA Piper has given between $50 - 100k to the Foundation.\n\nIt gets even cozier. \n\nDLA Piper executive Douglas Emhoff is taking an extended leave of absence from the firm. \nWho is Douglas Emhoff?   \nHe is the husband of KAMALA HARRIS! Just a coincidence?   Amazing if it is. You can't make this stuff up! And it only gets worse.  \n\nThis \"Family Tree\" will make your head spin. THE SWAMP IS DEEP!!   \n\nDominion (voting machine provider) serves 40% of the US market.   It is in 30 states - - \nThe state of Texas rejected the machines.   \n\nAdmiral Peter Neffenger is on Biden's transition team.   Neffenger was the President of the board of Smartmatic   \n\n- Smartmatic (another voting machine supplier) entered into an agreement with Dominion in 2009   - Smartmatic counted votes in Venezuela   - Smartmatic is connected to Philippine voter fraud. \n\nSmartmatic is run by Lord Mark Malloch Brown who works for George Soros (he and Brown are life-long friends). Brown chairs the Boards of a number of non-profit boards including the Open Society Foundation,  Brown chairs the Centre for Global Development.   \n\nOpen Society of course is owned by George Soros. Smartmatic partnered with DLA Piper Global   - Douglas C. Emhoff works at DLA Piper Global   - Douglass C. Emhoff is Kamala Harris's husband   \n\nGuess who owns Dominion? \nBlum Capital Partners, L.P.  \nGuess who is on the board for the company? Richard Blum.  \nRichard C. Blum is Dianne Feinstein's husband.\n\nNancy Pelosi's husband is also a major investor   \n\nAn aide to Nancy Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, was hired by Dominion Voting Systems. And it goes on.\nDominion Voting Systems is listed on the Clinton Foundation website.   \nDominion Voting is listed as a $25,000 -$50,000 donor to the Clinton Foundation in 2014 by The Washington Post.\n\nGeorgia Governor Kemp used Dominion Voting after Texas and Florida rejected them.\n\nDominion has a lobbyist named Jared Thomas   - Jared Thomas was Governor Brian Kemp\u2019s chief of staff and press secretary from 2012 to 2015.\n\nYou must remember the Feinstein-Kavanaugh-Soros connections to understand this next information:\nDebra Katz (Christine Ford's lawyer) worked for George-Soros at the Open Society Foundation.   Debra Katz (Christine Ford's lawyer) also worked at Project on Government Oversight (POGO).   - POGO is funded by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. POGO is the co-signer of the letter Diane Feinstein presented against Kavanaugh's nomination.   \n\nKamala Harris did not prosecute OneWest Bank for their fraud when she had the authority.\nSoros owned OneWest Bank. \nNow you know why a woman who placed 7th in own her State when running for President is now VP!

There is always a broad group of ostensibly moderate people, usually on the right wing or even most of the right wing, who believe that, in certain situations, democracy is not preferable.\n\nThis is why governments can get away with supporting brutal dictatorships abroad (e.g. the USA supporting all these \"anti-communist\" dictators throughout the cold war), and why, when certain people think their (real or imagined) privileged position in society is threatened by other groups attaining equality, they will flip to support a strongman to put the latter back in their place. The emotional reaction to a threat is what triggers it, but the underlying reason is that they don't really support democracy and never have. They just told themselves they did.\n\nThe practical answer in the USA is probable that you elected Obama. He was the visible exponent of a (way too slow, but steady) march towards political and socioeconomic equality, and this triggered the usual fear reaction in people who tell themselves they are democratic but are actually just reactionaries.", "label": 1}

{"text": "It was infuriating how clearly the \"stop the count\" demands were manipulative of people that completely misunderstood how elections work. When a network declares a winner it's just a projection, they still count every vote to come up with the official numbers. It's important to do it that way for many reasons, not least of which is that in 2020 Trump repeatedly told his followers only to vote on election day, when some states count election day votes first, and early vote and mail in ballots are held to be counted after, so *of course* his early lead would not hold. Many networks didn't call the race early in those states because they knew this, and were calling it the \"red mirage.\" It was a scheme they planned so they could cry foul, meanwhile the postmaster general he appointed was simultaneously trying to self sabotage the USPS sorting facilities slowing down *all mail*, so that mail-in ballots wouldn't arrive on time to be counted.\n\nIn many states like Texas, not only do they count every vote they do audits of the paper votes to make double extra sure there were no errors with the machines used to tally the votes quickly. This takes time. Every state has different laws for how they carry out the election process and do not need federal approval to make changes. We also had an extra week of early voting in 2020 due to the pandemic, which came as a proclamation by our republican governor Abbott. I wonder if Trump thinks Texas was trying to steal the election? Trump was also using the pandemic as an excuse to call for the election to be postponed indefinitely, gee how convenient for him, so he doesn't have any ground to stand on claiming the states didn't get legislative approval for the process that had to change in response to the pandemic.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First of all, I want to say, since my account will probably be gone tomorrow, that I appreciate the honest dialogue.\n\nIt's not my feelings.  It's an observable reality taken from watching the UK withdraw gender affirming care for minors and the release of the Cass Review.  Which to date was the only comprehensive study done that examined all previous studies and found the 'scientific' foundations they were built on to be extremely weak.  They also availed to what amounts to moral extortion making the claim that if minors don't receive gender affirming care they are more prone to suicide.  But if these minors weren't under the influence of too much exposure to social media or other outside influences, the likelihood that they would diagnose their psychological distress as being rooted in being in the wrong body is extremely low.  Then you have this movement of grade school teachers secretly counseling children without the knowledge of the parents in this line of thinking.\n\nIt has been shown repeatedly that puberty is the primary thing that resolves gender dysphoria.  By blocking it, you are not giving people time to choose, you are confirming them in their trans identity.  Yes puberty blockers have been medically prescribed to minors, but it has been for a serious medical issue.  NOT as part of a gender affirming care regime.  They are NOT without consequences.  Besides potential sterility and osteoporosis, the experience of going through puberty in your 20s after one has decided they are not trans cannot be a pleasant experience.  You acknowledged yourself that this movement might crash.  So how are we to look at the people who regret the decisions made under the influence of adults?  Fodder of an experiment?\n\nDespite this affecting such a small population, the population affected by endorsing it is not small, and their concerns must be spoken to.  Do you think it was only the two girls that had a problem?  No, it's probably the whole league.  Do you support the notion of ANYONE being able to use the bathroom/changeroom of their choosing based on how they identify regardless of what steps they have or haven't taken to transition?  Can you imagine the kind of nefarious people that would take advantage of that?\n\nI just don't believe the stuff with kids is being promoted out of a genuine, legitimate concern for their well-being.  I think it's the new progressive thing that politicians on the left are using as a identity politics banner.  You put it in schools or in other places where it can't be ignored, you inject it into the culture and can label anyone who opposes it a transphobe, bigot, etc.  To me it's all just a big smoke screen to distract people from issues that actually matter.  Now you're probably going to say it's only people on the right that are taking issue with it but again, once it's in schools, it can't be ignored.", "label": 1}

However, they do tend to correlate well with how the House popular vote turns out. That might seem like a rather weak indicator, especially given gerrymandering, but it's the best statistically supported conclusion we can draw from special elections. Of course, that doesn't preclude women from handing Dems a trifecta this year in their fury over Dobbs, it's just that special elections aren't a reliable predictor of that result. What they *do* tell us is that Dems have a pretty good chance of winning the House, even if Trump wins the presidency and the GOP wins the Senate.", "label": 1}

This ideology is fueled by their expansionist policies, leading to the forced displacement and occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nMoreover, they have implemented a system of segregation and discrimination against the Palestinian population, restricting their movement, access to resources, and basic human rights.

They had the numbers but me giving them dirty looks made them look at their shoes.  I thought these jerks were supposed to be so tough.  They were all fucking cowards.  They could have easily jumped me, but they were too busy looking at the ground.  The media portrays them as one thing, but what they really are is scared clowns, waiting for their clown prince to save them.  \n\nIn NY we don't really see true maggats.  A few years ago i saw a few of them in front of the NY times building and they started talking shit about me (dark skinned Latino).  I am born and bred Brooklyn, so I stepped to them.  HAHHAHAHA how quickly they apologized.  Not only am I a Latino, but I am also not a tall dude, I have diabetes, and quite honestly do not look like a threat.  But Maggats are so timid they were actually terrified by me.  There were like 3 of them, and yet they folded so fast.  \n\nToday I probably would have messed with them more, but I was with my family.  I am not a bully, but Stephen Knight (trump's bitch) has basically already said that he wants to march Latinos to enslavement camps.  I love reading WWII history, so does Stephen Knight, while I feel like we should never have internment camps, Knight insinuates Latinos should be in them, regardless of us being illegal, legal or whatever.  So when I see these maggats, my anger rises.  \n\nWhile I am not a fighter, if any of these cowards would have stepped to me I would have tried to handle it as best as I could.

Sadly, I think it will be a fascist blow out which will give Trump and his goons carte blanc to fuck over the nation and rest of the world. All thanks to the dangerous power of stupid people.

These are career statisticians that are doing the number crunching. Independents can help but assume worst case is in red or blue leaning states they tend to drift toward whoever is the majority. If NC and NV are going red then independents will typically follow. It\u2019s hard to catch up to a large firewall of banked early votes on Election day because you have to overcome a large deficit.

Go look at early voting numbers. Every swing state has Republicans crushing records and Dems lagging behind. And guess what the age gaps are? Below 55 are representing about 45%. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m pissed too but I\u2019m also a realist not living off hopium. Our fellow Americans are borderline brain \ud83e\udde0 dead.

The fact that you aren't following sub rules, already shows that you, similar to the writer don't understand how Reddit works on a fundamental level.\n\nDude. If this is about the Federalist's story- it reflects a complete lack of understanding of how Reddit works. And the fact that the story equated this activity to fake reviews on Amazon shows you all you need to know about the rigour-ness of the so called investigation and report. \n\nEven if this was a large scale enough event (something the 'investigation' could not provide proof of in the form of actual number of people involved etc- shoddy and quick investigation this must be considering it shows only a few accounts (profiles) over the period of ONE month! Wow what an expose! ) rather than a few dozen volunteers, it would still not qualify for brigading accusations and violation of Reddit rules.\n\nAnd considering Politics is a liberal leaning sub and the design of Reddit is such that all subs have specific leanings and attract people with common interests (have specific/niches/ audiences etc),  people coming on the sub know what to expect. In the same way, that they expect the conservative sub to have only posts and articles that are negative about Kamala, they know Politics is the place to read pro liberal content. Try checking out the Redscare pod sub for extremely targetted and extremely anti Kamala posts and comments. \n\nAnd and and, far more importantly none of this (even if true) would make a difference of any notable sort cuz all that these volunteers are doing is amplifying content. The stories are neither written by the campaign nor researched by them. They are sharing existing articles written by publications which exist in the public domain. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign is putting up billboards of Kamala sucking cock. So yeah. A photoshopped lie. Versus whatever this bullshit shoddy reporting is trying to cover.\n\nP.s. The fact that the writer of the Federalist article could not even be arsed to provide the link of the discord where this so called activity is happening shows you exactly why no one should take the report seriously. Screenshots can be manufactured- since there was no link on the article, I am going to take this story with a big fat grain of salt. If you are doing an expose- make sure you attach receipts.

{"text": "I posted this in an LGBT thread on another sub recently, but I think it applies to all minorities and really anyone else who isn't on the Nazi's side:\n\nIt sounds bizarre, but the recent rally at Madison Square Garden may have been in our favor, as it had them going so mask-off that it is now undeniable they intend to \"other\" and attack anyone who is not on their side. This is what fascists do to seize and attempt to maintain power.\n\nWhat we know from history is that typically this process starts off slow and gets larger over time. Trans people are unlikely to be the first targeted, it will probably be migrants (legal or otherwise).\n\nAs awful as that is, there are two key things to remember here:\n\n1) They are openly making an enemy out of EVERYONE who is not a straight, white, Christian, Republican, cisgender man. So they're openly making enemies with 70% of the population.\n\n2) It is not 1940. We have the internet, cell phones, guns (and more guns). The United States is HUGE. This isn't Europe where you can drive through four countries in six hours.\n\nIf and when they start pulling shit, even if they dress it up as a \"migrant removal task force\" or whatever it's going to be, people are going to be aware of it immediately and it will be all over the internet.\n\nThey'll try to suppress access to the internet and to apps like TikTok and Reddit. People will get around that quickly, just like they do in countries where these sites are banned. They are severely underestimating the ingenuity and intelligence of the majority of people in this country.\n\nThese fascist policies will affect them, too. Even hardcore Republicans have family members somewhere who are minorities or LGBT. If people start getting rounded up, they're going to either have to do what the Nazis did in the 1940s (>!which was to kill entire families at once so nobody would come looking for revenge!<), or they're going to have a huge fight on their hands.\n\nI'm still drinking my morning coffee so this might not be totally coherent, but my main point is this:\n\nLook for the differences, not just the similarities.\n\nYes, it's obvious that Trump is a fascist and that his party is an openly Nazi party. However it is also true that this is an entirely different geographical, political, and technological situation than 1940s Germany was. We have a level of communication and the ability to defend ourselves that is unheard of in previous generations.\n\nEven hardened soldiers and law enforcement officers are hesitant to go up against a barricaded person with an AR-15. If these Nazi enforcement squads ever really start popping up, they're going to get shot at constantly. People know if they're captured, they're dead, so they'll fight to the death.\n\nTL;DR Technology, society, and the second amendment are on our side even in a worst-case scenario.", "label": 1}

The man has already been charged with fraud by the SEC and allegedly isn't adhering to the settlement rules.\n\nHe tried to take it to the Supreme Court, they declined.\n\nHe was supposed to testify two weeks ago and didn't show up\n\nHe doesn't seem to want to admit publicly about whether he did the deposition earlier this week: \n\nThis is speculation, but I also suspect that the wealthiest early TSLA backers are gearing up to send him to prison for funneling money (and apparently engineering resources) from the publicly traded equity they invested in away to his private company (Twitter). That is beyond illegal in every sense of the rules of Wall Street. Especially as he's on record lying about it.\n\nCould it be made-up self-victimizing? I guess so. But Elon Musk has allegedly committed fraud and seems to be reluctant to show a good faith effort to follow the rules, and could very well face criminal consequences for not adhering to the settlement or being found in contempt of court. There's a popular narrative that everyone on Wall Street is committing crimes, but the SEC does what it can to keep it a level playing field and they're the one agency that people generally don't want to fuck with.

Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0resided.
