{"text": "There's always a balance of individual AND collective responsibility for the outcomes people face in life.  To add some nuance to this point though, something that the left very rightfully points out is that complete free choice and agency is somewhat of an illusion.  Sure, we all have agency but our choices are not always as free as they seem.  There are often cultural and systemic forces at work constraining our 'free' choices.   \n  \nFor example, the right will criticize the gender pay gap by saying that women are simply choosing not to work as many hours or in as stressful job that pay well, instead freely choosing  a more balanced, soft life that pays less. We know that women are not doing this necessarily, although there might be quite a few who do make this choice. The left rightfully points out that there are structural factors getting in the way of women choosing higher pay more stressful careers and more overtime, such as pressure to raise kids, a predominance of male cantered work culture, harassment, not being valued as a women for your work accomplishments, etc.    \n  \nAlthough men do not suffer under patriarchy in the same way women do, I think it is quite reasonable to conclude that their choices are also constrained in some ways. Toxic masculinity actually could be one external factor explaining the constrained choice of some men to do down the incel path.  However toxic masculinity is often described as an internal personal error/problem that needs to be entirely fixed by the individual men.  It's true, individual men need to fight through notions of toxic masculinity but also we can ask, how do external factors perpetuate this internal experience and how can we communicate with empathy to these men, seeing them as victims of the system too who need help to make healthier choices?", "label": 0}

But it\u2019s the application of those things that I think we differ on. \n\n\nSo much of the toxic male experience, and toxic online rhetoric revolves around sex/dating. There is an entitlement and bitterness that they are owed these things to work out for them or be for them, and there is no accountability that those take work. or there is another person on the other side of their desire who also has wants and needs. \n\n\nAnother example is media. Constant vitriol online because media since the dawn of time has catered exclusively towards them and now has widened to all kinds of people and they take that personally. There is an entitlement that they turn gross. There is no accountability that maybe just because they like something, doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be the prevailing way things are done. It can be **a** way, there is still a vast majority of media for them. But does **all** media need to be for them?\n\n\nThere is **of course**, another side to that. It isn\u2019t just men. It never is just one group of anything. But the toxic and hateful rhetoric online is mostly from men thinking they are owed this things because they are frustrated. They are young, they want a villain. \n\n\nIt does not need to be self sacrifice, it needs to be mindfulness. This is where our perspectives on these applications diverge. \n\n\nAccountability is the mindfulness that you yourself also have faults, and stuff to work on. Acceptance that there are paradigms outside yourself that also have value. No group actually wants to destroy you, they just want you to treat them well, and you are owed the same. Entitlement is just the idea that you are not owed these things from other people.  \n\n\nYour examples are real, but they touch on a totally different form of inequality that we should all be rallying behind because it moves past political stance. **wealth inequality**.\n\n\nThese losers flaunting without shame are usually from a growing pool of generational wealth, which has created an internet filled with content that makes people by and large depressed by seeing the life they do not live. THOSE people are not the ones i\u2019m talking about. That is its own issue and very valid to critique. The internet is garbage and filled with garbage. Those people have no accountability and are filled with entitlement because their wealth is a shield from consequence. \n\n\nTo your final point. These applications do not need to be sacrificial.

Typically, the ship is responsible for delays during the sea-passage, but the port is responsible for delays in harbour. Further, the delivery clock resets in a way in port; this is called lay time. Contracts of carriage will specify an amount of allowable lay time. If the ship is still in the harbour limits when the laytime expires, the port has to pay demurrage. If a ship has to wait all day for a bridge to open, the harbour is the one that will have to pay for that lost time.

{"text": "> I often see adoption described as expensive in the USA - where does the money go?\n> \n> I'm familiar with US surrogacy, where the costs includes lawyers, agency fees, fertility treatment, healthcare for the surrogate, healthcare for the baby, pregnancy related expenses and then compensation for the surrogate. Very crudely, it's essentially making a baby and renting the surrogate's body to carry and birth that baby.\n> \n> But with adoption the baby is already made and born. I'm assuming there\u2019s agency fees and legal advice in private adoption - but I realised I have no idea how the system actually works!\n\nThere are two paths to adoption -- private and through the state. \n\nThrough the state is people relinquish their children, or their children are removed, and they can go to foster or, see above, if it's an infant, there is a massive waiting list. \n\nA lot of times if you've been approved to adopt, which is a long process that can cost $$ as it involves submitting things like medical exams, and having someone from the state come inspect your home and they can require you do specific things like turn something into a bedroom, fix some issue (if you have a room you were going to turn into a bathroom but stopped they can say you can't have the construction, etc.) and you need to have like a CPR certification, may need to take a parenting class... but if you've been approved, and are on a list waiting for an infant and someone in, say, a state you've been approved in, the state social worker can just randomly call you and say there's an infant born yesterday do you want it? That's relatively cheap, save the costs above. \n\nHowever, the waiting list for an infant is literally 5-10 years. \n\nSo if people can, they often try private adoption. First thing is those agencies charge hefty fees. They do spend a lot of time and $$ counseling women who come to them asking about adoption, and they screen the people and help people set up profiles. Private adoptions are generally, not always but almost, ones in which the woman chooses the parents. So those involve not only the above state approval, but you need to make a profile, with pics, explain who you are, basically why they should want to give you a child. Those can cost $$$$. If you're chosen to adopt that woman's baby, you're often meant to cover medical and base costs while she's pregnant, including travel, and people do what they can. They make sure someone has access to good food, proper medical care, doulas... \n\nAnd then, depending on the state, see above, the woman can change her mind. She always can before the baby is born, and then you're out the $$. That happens not infrequently, in that someone thinks they're going to place their baby, and the prospective adopters they choose spend months supporting them, helping, becoming involved as possible and then she changes her mind.", "label": 0}

But the basic intended idea is that if you're experiencing a much lower rate of success than you're expecting, then you need to re-evaluate the process before you go running any more of what is technically a finite resource through it.\n\nAs for your second point, it's true that stopping the machine won't fix the issue on its own, but it will stop making it worse at least. And the need to step back and assess what's going wrong is an important part of the process that requires the machine to be off first.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">For every Shapiro or Tate we need a leftist (broadly speaking) male counter part who can give the same young men the kind of space those other brainwashing fuck heads give, and to help actually try and fix the inherent issues. \n\nThis is true, but will be hard to accomplish because in my experience, males are moving to the manosphere *overwhelmingly* because of dating and mating issues.  I'm in no way saying young men don't have other issues worthy of attention, but they themselves will usually admit that being depressed, feeling like they lack social support, hating being viewed as a predator by default, and so forth, are kind of seen as secondary to the greater overarching concerns about dating.\n\nSurprisingly, a lot of self-labeled incels would actually be firmly aligned with the left politically if not for their feelings that the left has nothing to offer them in terms of actionable and *guaranteed successful* dating advice.  \n\nThe manosphere really doesn't give out much in the way of successful dating advice either, but they provide *explanations*, a cohesive worldview, and a bunch of pseudoscience that convinces many young men that the manosphere is giving out \"cheat codes\" and specific standards to strive for so they will be *definitely* be romantically/sexually successful, IF they devote themselves to meeting those standards, even if that means saving up for jaw implants and barbaric leg lengthening surgery.\n\nI think the single biggest issue young males susceptible to manosphere types of negative influence are facing isn't so much that they despise the female sex (although some of the older incels definitely end up that way), but paradoxically that they put the female sex on an absolutely absurd pedestal and thus grant women and approval from women WAY too much power over their lives and their mental health.\n\nI've seen so many young men saying things along the lines of \"Why should I bother going to college/getting my own apartment/learning a trade/developing hobbies/becoming financially stable *if it doesn't even GUARANTEE me a loving wife and family*!?\"\n\nSuch men end up just stuck in time and not developing normally into functioning adults because they think everything else in their lives would just magically fall into place if only they got the romantic/sexual approval from women that they so desperately crave.  They don't have their own identity and they don't know how to get an identity until they can prove that women desire them.\n\nThese lonely guys don't want to hear the kind of generic \"improve yourself, stop putting so much emphasis on dating, and learn to love YOURSELF so you have power over your own life\" dating advice that most people would tell them.  They want science, numbers, and formulas; even if that information gets them no closer to getting a date, at least it lets them quantify *exactly* why they aren't having success dating, perhaps because they're \"only\" 5'10\" and manosphere types are telling them they'll die alone since they aren't six feet tall.\n\nSo getting these males to embrace the left and not fall prey to manosphere influencers and communities is a complex problem because there are two things that need to happen.  These males have to be pitched left leaning ideals and policies in a way that resonates with them, which I actually think isn't that hard, really, but BEFORE we can do that, first we've got to somehow get these males to de-center dating, mating, and female approval from their lives, and I have no clue how to do that.\n\nBasically, until the left is able to offer young males either more strategies for dating success OR raise their self-esteem dramatically enough that they stop obsessing over dating success, they're likely going to get pulled into the manosphere *even if their actual political beliefs would much better suit the left*, and it's because prolonged time in the manosphere will start causing these males to turn to the right wing politically more generally.", "label": 0}

However, the focus has been on how women are pressured to stay home with the kids and forfeit her career.  I think there is an opportunity to advertise more to men along the lines of:  \n  \n\"you've been unfairly burdened with the provider and protector role. Although these roles can convey some advantages and sense of value, its not fair that men are forced down this path and is often damaging physically and mentally for many men, especially in middle/lower class.  Men should have the opportunity to live a more varied and fulfilling life by being taken care, taking time off work for their kids, hobbies and family, or simply live a softer live if their interests and or physical/mental health make that path more reasonable.  Men if you find meaning and value in working insane and stressful or dangerous jobs to provide for a loved one then go for it but you shouldn't feel obligated. You matter, your wellbeing matters, and we are focused on creating a meaningful and valuable position for you outside of being a disposable draft horse.\" \n\nA version of my wording above does exist on the left but is very limited and more of an afterthought. The focus remains on women's experience of their gender role and how they are being left out of the working world. I think frustration for men now is that women's roles have opened up quite a lot.  We see really high educational achievement and an improvement in women's career prospects.  On the flip side, we've failed to create a safe, meaningful space for men to step back from their draft horse role if they so choose. \n\nIf the left also drove harder at this inequality for men by validating their experiences AND also pointing out that women's advancements in the workplace takes pressure off of their expected provider role, maybe the sexes could come together on this one.", "label": 0}

With the addition that I believe they had to get permission from the C-suite to establish the group, which I thought really highlighted the need for the group, as it required approval from a group of men to be allowed to exist. Before my example, I should state again that I don't think a cis-male support group would function the same as other support groups. In regard to impacting work place policy, I don't see why this kind of group would need to affect policy or not.\n\nIn particular, I think the proposed group would have positive outcomes (an inclusive environment being a positive outcome) if it seeks to address the opposite end of similar issues you stated, while still catering to issues that may disproportionately affect men. I also think it needs to have a significant open element in regards to bringing in people from other support groups to develop deeper understanding of others while with your peers. I'm not going to make a distinction solely for white males, everybody wants to feel like they belong in the spaces they occupy. Maybe a group specifically for white males makes sense at one place, but not the next. I think you could drop any of the terms white/cis/male and it wouldn't change that it's important for people to hear from the experiences of other people like them in a peer group setting. \n\nEx1. George thinks he got passed up on a promotion because of what he perceives as a DEI hire, George was fine before but he now sucks to be around. If there was a group George was a part of where he could feel safe enough to make that claim, and then have it explained to him by his peers that Jill was a great hire for X,Y,Z reason and that George does have good skills but needs to improve in X,Y,Z, that would be more impactful for everyone as opposed to letting George figure it out on his own. Even if there is no discernable X,Y,Z reason Jill is better than George for the position, a place to go where George can make his claim and then get feedback from peers could help George understand more about the importance of inclusion, without feeling completely excluded, because it's coming from his peers. You could just fire George, but that's not going to do anything to remedy how George perceives that situation, and he would just carry that wherever he goes. \n\nEx2. Michael is recently divorced and lost his custody battle, he now lives alone. Maybe Nick had the same thing happen to him, and he didn't need a group's support, but he recognizes what Michael is going through and that he may need some sort of companionship. The group is there to support Michael while he learns to accept his new reality. If it's impacting his work, his peers are there to have an honest conversation about getting back to where he was, with their support.\n\nEx3. A young female is hired and it's the first woman in the office. The group has a conversation before her arrival in regard to how to include her in the flow without overstepping boundaries, and what to do if you overstep a boundary, regardless of intent. A few people in the group have never worked with women and they have questions they would be scared to ask. Maybe the group invites a woman from another office as a guest speaker that has experienced the same things as the new hire, and she can help develop a greater understanding of how to navigate those boundaries for the group.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Sure, that is the view currently by religious leader, but historically that has also not been the case. Ancient caliphates were actually very liberal in their practice of Islam after the religion had spread to as far as Southern Spain. Likewise, while Christianity has traditionally been against homosexuality, several Christian countries have embraced the concept of gay marriage and even the Catholic church has made steps to recognize it within its institution. That is not to say that, at the same time, there are multiple other Christian institutions working against gay marriage and the like.\n\nReligion is not an unchanging thing. Like any other ideology, they go through changes and reforms, specially at the institutional level. It is the reason why both Islam and Christianity have multiple versions and institutions instead of just following a single monolithic authority.\n\nFurthermore, religious leaders don't represent the average believer. Again, you are choosing to look at the most extreme voices as an absolute representation of all followers of said faiths. You tell me to do a little digging, but I think you are the one that needs to do a lot of digging here. There are practicing muslim women today, protesting muslim oppression in Iran, There are married gay couples who practice Christianity, There are openly gay muslims. These facts alone should contextualize the difference between individual believers and religious institutions.\n\nI understand your view on Muslim extremist advocating for against things like homosexuality in the west and I also don't like it. However, we live in a democratic country that has progressed socially by allowing people to express themselves. Labeling all muslims as problematic because of the extremist minority, is just oppression and then we just find ourselves turning into a fascist country.", "label": 0}

So much is about repressing and outward shows of masculinity or sexuality that deflates and crushes. This expectation breeds resentment. \n\n\nBut outside of that, I think you and I differ on perspective because we\u2019re looking at different points of contact where this resentment builds, but both within\u2019 societal constructs. \n\n\nYour points are about the pressures of status and wealth, and their expectations weighing down men when they are constantly shown through cultural osmosis their own failure. Which breeds resentment. I think this is totally fair. I think this is worth empathy. \n\n\nBut to gain that empathy is hard because it is being blocked by what I see as social contracts they are avoiding. Which is sort of where I find the rub. I think men are being easily targeted and shown to think selfishly by a more extreme rhetoric which sort of breaks down any empathy one could have. It\u2019s hard to punch down on a group that\u2019s loudest voices are punching down. It\u2019s hard to have empathy for a group who\u2019s loudest voices are looking to regress everyone else to make themselves not feel small. \n\n\nMy answer is there needs to be an accountability, which does not need to involve shame. It just needs to involve growth. This empathy and inclusivity will only make others empathetic. For example: you are allowed to like your hot anime babe to be your protagonist and everyone is sexy, but you also should recognize some people don\u2019t want that and there can be room for both. \n\n\nThe shitty reality is, both of our issues are solved if we weren\u2019t so poor and had more attainable spaces to make connections and relationships in the real world. The magical 3rd space. I think people looking to the internet for refuge is a huge issue for all groups. It locks you into your bubble and you watch life happen from a looking glass that losses all nuance and context and breeds resentment. The focus on status would mean less if you had options for community with people who shared interest. Which is all but disappearing outside of games and fandom\u2026which are both somewhat unhealthy. \n\n\nSo basically, I see where you\u2019re coming from.

{"text": "First of all, I want to say, that I am largely in favor of the policy. I do think that there is a possibility of a downside here. I want to focus in on media companies since they seem to be the main focus of the policy. I'm also going to use Netflix as an example, but it stands for all the online media companies. \n\nThe way Netflix currently operates is that some money is set aside to pay for media that has already been created elsewhere. For many years this was the only media to be found on Netflix. Other money is budgeted to creating their own media. After Netflix made this change is when they started having big spikes in prices. Many consumers already cancel and resign when seasons for bigger productions are airing. With the ease of cancelations this will only become more prevalent. Without the money coming in during down time they will have to make a choice between lowering budgets, cutting out original programming, or keeping people engaged.  Netflix will have a lot of restructuring and decisions to make. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, however...\n\nTraditionally television subscriptions operated on a bundle mentality. You paid for like 500 channels and the money brought in from the major networks helped subsidize the smaller channels. One of the initial benefits  to cutting out cable and moving to streaming was that it allowed you to pay for the things you watched and not all that other junk. This had the consequence of smaller networks needing to innovate their programming. This isn't the place to really talk about this, but as quick examples, The History Channel and TLC are good examples of what happens when smaller networks have to find money. All of this leads to what I think is the big downside. \n\nStreaming channels that want to create original content that do not have another traditional avenue to do so, will bundle sales together in order to keep active viewership. Click to Cancel will be irrelevant because if you want to cancel Netflix you will also have to cancel 5 other services at the same time. If you use the majority of the services then you will not want to cancel just because of the few you don't and you will not have another option to get those services as a standalone product. This will of course mean higher prices, \"Look at all the stuff you get.\" \n\nA lot of this is based on some assumptions from someone who does not have any access to actual metrics that these companies have, but the fact that they all are standing against the policy means that they are certainly in talks about what they will do if they fail and I think that this is a very likely idea that would get thrown around.", "label": 0}

But, you do not get to control the very core individual agency of other people. \n\nWho someone chooses to be in a relationship is one of the single most intimate choices that a person can make for themselves. \n\nSo every person MUST get the right individually to make that choice. But, relationships are a 2way street and must be agreed upon by all participants fully and willingly. \n\nBeing 'owed' anything in this realm is fundamentally negating one of the individuals' ability to choose about an important thing in their life to some extent. \n\nThere is no help that the community can provide here that respects all people's individual rights besides giving people the tools for self improvement. \n\nFor a relationship, you must choose each other. If you choose someone but they do not choose you, that is their choice and their individual humanity must be respected. \n\nA home does not have sentient agency, your training and skillset is not a person making it's own choices. Those can be actively provided and aided by others. \n\nNow people could CERTAINLY spread this with more compassion, I def think the left should. But I do not begrudge people recoiling at people wanting this to be something that is 'taken care of' for them or have the community help with this when it was before (forced marriages, lack of power and individual autonomy to choose your partner in history, etc.). Because that inquiry of, \"why is this not being helped?\" Can easily be a veil for dehumanization of peoples agency. \n\nIf I want a relationship with someone but that person doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, while that certainly sucks for me, that is that individuals right to choose. Someone has to want to be in a relationship with me as well. The only way I can improve the odds of that without it trampling on another person's rights is by me, the individual improving or changing. And sometimes, no matter how much I may change or improve, this other individual will never want to be in a relationship with me. That is just their right and their choice. If I am gay and I find a man I consider attractive, but they are heterosexual, no amount of me improving my individual self will make me an appealing partner to them.

{"text": "I think there are a few big barriers as far as the left taking male issues more seriously:\n\n1: Many males are suffering from numerous problems in their lives that society could possibly help, but most of the time, they're not complaining about any of *those* problems but rather they focus on dating and \"the unfairness of the sexual economy.\"\n\nThey may be deeply lonely, depressed, unable to find a job, lacking purpose in their lives--all  valid and serious concerns, but there is this pernicious belief among many of these males that if they could only just get validated as a romantically/sexually desirable person, then all the other problems would somehow vanish.  \n\nWomen and other men often try to give these guys advice because we feel for them, but they rarely care about self-improvement for its own sake and tend to only be interested in types of self-improvement that *guarantee* dating/mating success, which of course is impossible.  We try to say that they should get some male social support, try some new hobbies, look into college, try therapy, etc., but these specific guys just don't see any of these steps as being worthy on their own.\n\nInstead of becoming the best men they can be for their *own* self-esteem and well-being so that *then* they'll be able to approach dating and relationships in a much healthier (and more successful!) way because romantic/sexual success is no longer central to their self-concept, they think the approval and validation of women is necessary FIRST to imbue them with the confidence and purpose to improve themselves.\n\n2: Men's Rights advocate types tend to raise awareness of legitimate male issues in exactly the worst circumstances possible as far as finding female allies.\n\nFor example, every feminist I know thinks male infant circumcision should be done away with, and would gladly support that cause once educated on the issue sufficiently, but most women only ever hear about this issue when MRAs bust into feminist spaces while they are talking about *female* genital mutilation (which happens to older girls without anesthesia and can involve COMPLETE excision of external genitalia) and call the feminists hypocrites for caring about one kind of genital mutilation and not the other.  You don't gain allies that way, and you're dismissing a horrific kind of female suffering to center yourself instead.\n\nSimilarly, they bring out the male rape statistics when women are discussing some absolutely horrific sex crime that was just done to a girl or woman.  \n\nAnother common \"Gotcha!\" attempt is complaining that only men have to register for the draft, even though the U.S. doesn't even have an active, legal draft currently and that most feminists would argue either that women *should also* be equally subject to the draft OR that NOBODY of either sex should be subject to the draft, so again, this dude is alienating potential allies!\n\n3: A related issue is that the males who are aware of male specific issues that could be mitigated socially, culturally, and/or politically AND who try to raise awareness of those issues are far too often the abrasive MRA type once again, and they will barge into feminist conversations--that could be on literally ANY subject--and say things like, \"Well, if feminists REALLY cared about equality, they would get more male domestic violence shelters built.\"\n\nSuch behavior makes it seem like the MRA types' *main* goals are to shut women up about their issues and to accuse feminists of hypocrisy for not being willing to do all the work *for* the men.  Feminists can be allies, but feminism can't be responsible for fixing every wrong that every group suffers.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> First of all: Capitalism punishes you for not working. \n\nThat's not quite true. Capitalism rewards people for owning capital. Capitalists don't really \"work.\" They own capital that does the work on their behalf.\n\n> So if your programm does the work of 100 million librarians, then why should you also take the moeny they need for existing? \n\nI'm saying you can separate this out. The algorithm that Larry Page and Sergey Brin crated in their garage in the late 90s really did replace 100 million librarians. Google stock has gone through the roof. Instead of relying on their meager wages from a now unnecessary job for a living, librarians should rely on owning Google stock (capital) for a living. Then they should use their free time and energy to do something else useful for humanity.\n\n> The only reason you could built that algorithm was because those 100 million librarians worked, enabling you to studies complex ideas that resulted in said programm. \n\nRight, and they got paid cash for it upfront. But it's better if they got paid in capital/stock, or if they used their cash wages to buy stock. Cash is *supposed* to lose 2% a year in value to inflation. Stock are supposed to increase 9.5% a year on average. After 2% inflation that leaves 7.5% a year in growth. That's the historical average of the S&P 500.\n\n> You did bring everything together but you did not built it from isolation in stone age. You were sitting upon the shoulder of giants. So its not your merit. 90% of it was based on the fact that several generations of humanity gave their work to accumulate enough wealth to support your endeavor.\n\nYes, and everyone has a choice to get paid cash wages today or to get paid capital that will pay out money consistently over the coming decades/centuries. I think everyone mistakenly chooses cash. This is especially unwise in a world where even the most exhausting labor is increasingly useless.\n\n> Secondly: In communism that also works. The only difference is that you do that out of intrinsic motivation and not out of extrinsic motivation. Several studies show that intrinsic motivation is the better motivator. You dont need to be paid more money, because you did it for the common good, which you are part of. You benefit from it because thoes 100 million libraries can alocate their workforce for othrt common good. Your reward is not money, but a better society to live in. Its like in your own daily life. IF you invent a new structure of time mangagement or on how you do certain taks, the reward is not money. THe reward is you living a better life.\n\nCool, you work hard. I'm just going to kick back and exploit you. Even if a million people work hard like you say, if there's at least one person who is willing to exploit others, they'll become the richest and most powerful person in the society. That's why every single communist country collapsed into an authoritarian dictatorship. In capitalism, the same dynamic of group cooperation applies. But you're not relying on trust. You've set up the system in a way where if other people try to exploit you, they lose. Then the more greedy other people are, the better. Capitalism means you can't rob or exploit others through the threat of violence. Your only way to make more money is to provide more value to others so they voluntarily give you more money. Well, you can still exploit the people who don't understand capitalism and who don't \"play defense.\" I think this applies to most Americans and most humans in general who are alive today. But if everyone in society understands how to protect themselves in a capitalist system, it's extremely difficult to exploit them. I think everyone needs to learn this ASAP so they stop being exploited by the few rich people who figured it out before them. \n\n> Thirdly: The shovel does already exist. We dont need to accumulate more capital. ITs already stacked. \n\nWe do need to accumulate more capital if we want to have a higher standard of living. I'm unwilling to live disease, poverty, suffering, etc. More innovation means more capital, which means less waste of the Earth's limited natural resources, which leads to a higher standard of living for all humans.\n\n> Communism will not be the death of invention beause to invent things lies in the nature of human curiousity. ANd we all can agree that curiousity is something we are born with. We also agree that in capitalist societies we see that children loose thier curiousity with time, while in other societies they do not. (go travel to small tibetian villages or indigious folks and you will see the difference).\n\nCapitalism allows a small village of 100 people to invest a small amount of money in the 1 person who they know has the best idea. Communism relies on central planning. A small committee of politicians decide where to invest all the money on behalf of society. They're aren't very good at it compared to 8 billion human all investing a tiny amount of money each. If they were, I'd be a communist.\n\n> Thats an overstatement and not true at all. Just look at the wealth distribution fo every country. THe top 1% own 50% of the wealth. \n\nYes, but that's misleading. Say you graduate from high school and get a job. Your net worth is $0, but you have 4 decades of working years ahead of you. If you save and invest a small percentage of your wages every year, by the time you retire, you'll have enough of a nest egg to no longer need to work. Your net worth is massive, but you have 0 working years ahead of you.\n\nConsider Social Security. If you have $500,000 saved up in a 401k, it'll produce $20,000 of cash a year (using the 4% rule). Meanwhile, the average Social Security payout is $22,344 per year. Social Security is basically a forced savings plan that comes out of your wages. My point is that net worth is tricky because the same person starts as super poor and becomes super wealthy as they save over their lifetime.\n\n> Who are you kidding with your numbers? We also know that great amounts of money grow faster than low amounts of money. \n\nThat's not true. It's harder to grow larger amounts of capital than smaller amounts. Warren Buffett talks about this regularly. But even if rich people invest optimally in in index funds, it's at best the same for everyone.\n\n> THis effect is accumulating. Just look at investment data and how the average grow of certain investments is. If you have a billion then it will grow with like 7% on average while the investments in the millions barely go over the inflation with 3-4% growth. THe data shows that billionairs are doubling every 7-10 years. (forbes data 2000-2024). While the net worth of all billionairs combined is doubling every 5-7 years (forbes data 00-24).\n\nI think you're focusing on the most successful billionaires and not they many more that are consistently losing money. But in any case, there's no reason why regular people can't also get that 7% after inflation return. The only catch is that a larger percentage of a poor person's wage is \"invested\" in Social Security, which has a much lower rate of return than the stock market.\n\n> When a crisis arises billionairs rise and gain wealth, while the poor 30% people struggle to even accumulate money. \n\nNot usually. Most billionaires lose a ton more money. But if you have a billion dollars and lose 99% of your money, you still have $10 million to survive on. A regular family who goes from $50,000 of income to $25,000 of income because one of the parents loses their job is in a much worse place. And it's even harder as a single person or single parent. A 50% loss ($25,000) for a poor person is a much bigger problem than a 99% ($990,000,000) loss for a rich person.\n\n> Data shows that those 30% are unable to even save some money since everything goes into keeping their existences. IF we look at the poor 50% then the amount of money they can save is basically enough to serve as a crisis fund.\n\nYes, but I think that learning how capitalism works creates a positive feedback loop. Instead of losing 2% a year to inflation and ending up poorer and poorer, people know how to make 7.5% a year and that way they become richer and richer. Once people understand how this concept works, we can get into ideas like UBI. UBI is basically just a trust fund for everyone in the world. But society has to reframe everyone as a capitalist who mostly gets income from investments/owning capital rather than a worker that mostly gets income via labor.\n\n> It is not even joke that you say that an investment of 100 dollars is equal to an investment of 100 million. Its blatantly dishonest.\n\nIn terms of the 7.5% return you get, it's the same. $107.5 million is obviously a lot more than $107.5, but $107.5 is a lot more than the $98 most people are currently getting. The reason why labor is so undervalued in society today and capital is so overvalued is because there are far more workers than capitalists. If every human learns how to become more of a capitalist, then the pendulum will swing to reward labor over capital.\n\nFor better or worse, humanity is playing Monopoly. If you're losing, you might want to switch to another board game like Life. But that's not possible because the other players don't want to switch. The best thing you can do is to learn the simple, but optimal strategies to win at Monopoly. If you don't learn them and just complain about the rules, you're going to have a miserable time.

I personally feel that it's more like a spectrum, with consciousness depending on how complex (not powerful \u2014 *complex*) a thing's information-processing ability is. \n\nI feel like it could be best illustrated as:\n\n* Humans \n* Chimpanzees, crows and parrots, dolphins, elephants, and the like \u2014 smart mammals\n* Dogs and most birds are somewhere about here\n* Less intelligent mammals and more intelligent reptiles/fish\n* Less intelligent reptiles/fish and occasional smart insects such as jumping spiders and bees\n* Starfish and most insects\n* Current generative AI (note this isn't *all* the way towards the bottom) and ant colonies\n* Non-animal life and individual ants, with fungi being somewhere towards the top and a virus being at the rock bottom\n\nNote that I said this is a spectrum; you could divide all of these into smaller and smaller sub-categories until you're listing each species to ever exist. The overall point, though, is that there's no clear dividing line between \"human-level consciousness\" and \"not human-level consciousness\"; obviously some things are far, far less conscious than humans, but you can't quantify *how* much less. \n\nIncidentally, on the basis of this, you could argue that it's ethical to eat humans as long as they're prepared without unusual cruelty, as disgusting as that is.", "label": 0}

Men don't like it and neither do the women attracted to men.  We are biological animals driven by hormones and deeply instilled instincts.  We can't just change our minds about sexual attraction.  We cannot substitute functioning family relationships with endless debates over power dynamics, implicit bias and scrupulously dividing everything to always be \"fair\".  As young men have noted, there is no corresponding enthusiasm to be fair about hypergamy. Do not let perfect be the enemy of good.  Relationships are supposed to be enjoyable, not some drama filled slog while you \"work\" on the relationship and yourself.  \n\nI apologize to men under age 30, because I believe we really screwed up in giving both sexes the tools to move into successful relationships.  We were wrong and the pendulum went too far.  Focus on being strong and kind.  Hold your standards and protect your resources. When biological clocks start ticking, the women will change their focus also.  If that doesn't work out, well it is a big world and there are women everywhere.

Their genes, their shape, their brains, their personality -- it was literally made by us, *in order for them to understand and connect with us.* \n\nNo other animal has had that experience. No other animals brain is literally shaped specifically to be emotional in-tune with human beings. All the other animals that humans selectively bred were bred for food production, wool, eggs, etc. Dogs are the only exception. \n\nIn that sense, eating a dog is arguably some sort of millennia-long, deep act of interspecies betrayal. When you literally create a species to help us, protect us, and love us, there's arguably a deep, deep immorality to looking at that dog, looking you in the eyes, and kill it for nothing more than a preferred flavor (as far as I know, there isn't anywhere on earth where dog meat is the most sensible, reliable, cost-effective food -- so it's not for survival, but flavor).", "label": 0}

{"text": "But that whole premise is just a false dilemma. It's not \"organized action **or** don't eat meat\". And you really think it's going to be remotely feasible to push for legislating the meat industry out of existence in a world where people can't even contend with the prospect of just eating less meat themselves? The situation, if anything, is the exact opposite: it will be far, far harder to make any kind of progress in such a direction until people can begin to adopt dietary changes at a larger scale.\n\nNot eating meat is a ridiculously minimal step to take if you're measuring it against mass organizing around reshaping agriculture. A world where that movement can make any kind of progress just doesn't exist until a larger number of people can get on board with very moderate dietary changes.\n\nLike I get it, understanding the systemic issues behind the world is always crucial, and often the actual root of the problem. But this is just not the same as most cases in that respect. Up until things like lab grown meat are fully developed, the world's meat consumption is just fundamentally not sustainable and is impossible to meet the demands of without the scale that factory farming provides. The situation will not change unless people can accept that individual change MUST come with it. You think that it's going to be easier to convince a movement of people to legislate the factory farming industry out of existence while all involved continue to change nothing about how they themselves consume it? If people can't stand adapting slightly within their own diets, what in the world makes you think they're going to stand alongside such a movement in the first place?", "label": 0}

{"text": "When I (30sM) was in my mid 20s, I was talking with my dad about how two of my best friends (a couple) were going on 7 years dating, were a bit untraditional, and believed in lifelong pair bonding, but not marriage. I told him I could see them together forever for sure, but probably not getting legally married or having kids. My dad literally chuckled, and told me \"wait until she sees her friends getting married and having babies -- a switch flips in women when that starts happening.\" I'm now in my mid 30s, and let me tell you, it's absolutely true. And honestly, it just sounds like that's what you're going through. \n\nAs for the marriage part, it's up to you how you want to handle it. Frankly, I think your boyfriend is being a bit immature. Marriage may be a bad deal, especially for guys if they're breadwinners, but it's so important symbolically, emotionally, and just frankly from an embracing maturity perspective. Also, there's nothing else that provides as much clear assurance that the person wants to stay with you for life. And for that person too, marriage provides a reason to stay together -- it's a commitment you made, and knowing you made that commitment helps to keep your mind from fantasizing about breaking up / cheating if and when the relationship hits rough patches. All guys pretty much have to accept that they'll eventually need to marry their girlfriends, unless they can somehow convince that girl of their own hippy dippy \"I don't see the point of legal marriage\" mantra. \n\nPersonally, if this is really getting to you, I'd just tell him that you do want marriage eventually, and you'd want to have a few kids by the time your his age. I know you came here asking people to change your view that you're far behind, but as a guy in my mid-30s with a girlfriend and no kids yet -- I just gotta tell you, you're not entirely wrong. You're not behind the curve yet (maybe you are compared to religious girls, sure, but forget that), but if you're 26 now, just do the math.

{"text": "I felt the same as you in the past, so I get this. I'm also a New Zealander. My mother got married at 27 and had me at 28. So when I was 26 I was stressing the hell out, as that was my role model of how life should play out. My younger sister then got married at 26 when I was 28 so I felt extra bad, even she was ahead of me. I felt old and like I was failing at life.\n\nI was desperate to find someone, but kept having failed relationships. I had a successful career, friends, hobbies etc. But the things I felt I was missing was things I needed someone else for. A partner. I couldn't get married alone, have biological children alone, or buy a house here alone. Particularly children. I've always always wanted children. And I know there's a ticking clock on that since by 35 it goes significantly downhill for women. And I'd want to do so with someone I'm married to, so that had to happen first.\n\nI spent my mid to late 20's in a funk trying to find someone to marry and have children with. I had partners, like yours, who were opposed to the idea of marriage and even some who weren't even sure if they wanted kids. I think, ultimately, they were silly excuses. Sure people divorce, my parents got divorced, I know more people divorced than married, I might get divorced. It didn't matter. It was about a commitment to me and a relationship. A level up. It didn't even have to be a formal marriage, a commitment ceremony of sorts to level up the relationship. And I found that was part of the excuses, exs didn't want to commit. They didn't want to put money in it. Not make a fuss. Not publicly share. Not put effort in. Didn't think about the future, just enjoyed the now. Got annoyed when I brought it up. I just realised my exs didn't like me enough and were toxic for other reasons and I was just sticking around out of desperate hope so left. I hope that's not the same with your partner. It felt like they were expecting us to fail so why try to begin with.\n\nThere is cultural and social expectations aspect; the 'relationship escalator' of marriage, kids, white picket fence etc. Don't feel bad for buying into it. But, the thing for me is, I don't care about societal expectations. It just so happens that's what \\*I\\* wanted. And it's okay to want to wear a dress and have your favourite people together in one place etc. I love event planning so it was the event I planned and wanted to big on. \n\nI got married a year ago last week to my wonderful husband. I was 31. I met him when I was 29. He's wonderful and everything I ever wanted. Nothing like my exs and a breathe of fresh air. He was good with moving fast because of my perceived schedule. But we were ready nonetheless and the pace ended up feeling natural. He wanted marriage and kids. I had my dream wedding. Literal perfection. Then we brought a house together and now we're trying for a baby. Couldn't be happier.\n\nSo maybe I didn't get married at 26 like my sister or 27 like my mother, but I got what I wanted. Maybe it wasn't slower spread out over time starting earlier, more condensed faster later, but still wonderful all the same. I'm so glad I didn't marry or have babies with my exs earlier, it wasn't the right time or person. And I got there in the end. I'm still young. \n\nYou will get there too. Next time you see a post of someone else having what you want, don't be sad you don't have it now - be happy you'll likely have it soon or at least one day. Maybe use your imagination to plan what you want in the meantime, turn it into a fun exercise not a sad one. Do stand up for your needs with your partner though, does he want kids and when? Make him stick to a schedule. If he really doesn't want to get married is there an alternative or middle ground? Noting that that there are legal benefits that help if wanting to have children or buying houses together that protect you etc. If he doesn't want to do anything with you and you just sacrifice all your dreams, is he even the right person for you?", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm 42, and though I've always been far left, I know exactly where you are coming from. I think that society has not dealt with the issues of privilege, power structures, and intersectionality very well. In large part, I think this is because the issues are seen to be minor from our higher echelons of society, and are not actually high priorities.\n\nThe big problem is that the levers that are currently being used to try to adjust for these societal issues are misaimed. As others have noted in discussing your situation, your teacher was absolutely mistaken for not recognizing the class/financial privilege your female classmate had *at that time*. But, 20 years from now, you are likely to find yourself in a largely male-dominated place in your middle age.\n\nThis is the societal problem. If you look at the majority of traditional higher-power/higher-paying roles in society, you find a majority of men in the senior roles. In my own field (academia), women make up a clear majority at the student, postdoc, and early-career roles, and have done so for at least a decade, if not more. The higher up the chain you go, the more men you find, until at the top positions the men make up about 70% of the positions.\n\nIt's true that society does punish men more for some things, but it also rewards men more for others. In a purely merit-based system, it practically has to do this since women are going to lose earning ability and years to childrearing *exactly at the time when men tend to be most productive*. These are the reasons why *all* of those women-only things exist, to provide ways for women to succeed equally around this fundamental difference. The problem is that we apply these levers and adjustments at very young ages (in school, university, etc), when the differences in privilege between men and women due to sex alone are (at least currently) much, much smaller, and arguably often benefit women more to begin with.\n\nWhat we should be doing, instead, is finding ways to adjust for expectations and experience in the 25-40 age range, when women really are losing out on opportunities compared to men, which then greatly reduce their ability to be in major leadership/top earning roles in their 40s-60s.", "label": 0}

Iran through its proxy forces launched an offensive and genocidal war against Jewish people which necessitates winning a war to prevent it from happening again. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are incredibly proud of what they did and planned to do it again. A country has a responsibility to its own citizens first. Israel is going way beyond the international standards to get non-combatants out of the way. It is far above the standards for urban warfare especially when fighting an enemy that as a matter of strategy gets its own people killed and then lies about the numbers. At least half of the death toll in Gaza are straight-up terrorists. The rest of the death toll is extremely murky on account of how Hamas operates, the fact that they use women and children for their operations, and the fact that they control the Health Ministry. When it comes to Hezbollah Israel has had a lot more time to prepare and has been extremely precise. The pager/radio operation was one of the most effective counter-terror operations in history with the lowest non-combatant deaths as a result. An expectation of zero civilian fatalities is not anywhere in the realm of reality. \n\n2. Gaza and Lebanon both have governing bodies that are also terrorist organizations, Hamas and Hezbollah, which Iran arms for the purpose of killing Jewish people. They exercised their rights and adult decision-making powers to gleefully murder Israeli citizens. Go watch the Hamas tapes, they were laughing and jubilant as they chased families into their bedrooms and by hand shot them, mutilated them, raped them, or burned them alive. They are the aggressors and don't get to claim self-defense when the consequences are losing the war they are still actively choosing. They have the right to surrender at any time and spend the billions in aid money on actually improving the lives of their own citizens. \n\n3. You're projecting and inverting again. You're proving my point by having to pose a hypothetical because Hamas and Hezbollah actually committed terrorism and Israel did not. Egypt did concretely try to bomb Israel out of existence at its founding and lost. But to entertain your scenario, if Israel turned into Hamas I would not support it and would support an invasion to remove whatever that government was. \n\nYour turn. If you don't think that the Aram-Muslim far right is uniquely evil at this stage in history, what Christian far-right or Jewish far-right government is hanging Persian people from cranes for refusing to wear preferred religious headgear?", "label": 0}

That\u2019s patently absurd.

If we predicate with that, then from there I think it should become evident that society as a whole is failing people by not giving them the skills or spaces to find fulfilling relationships. Things like the slow death of third spaces and hobbies and the rise of dating apps, I think, should be strong indicators of this. \n\nAgain, to emphasize \u2014 no *singular person* owes anyone anything, but as a whole I think it is a reasonable assumption to say that most people can find fulfilling and healthy relationships when put into the correct situations with the right people. Society is failing to make that happen, so of course we have lots of lonely young men \u2014 and women. \n\nFor various reasons women achieve more intimacy than men in platonic bonds, so men are more hurt by this, but I\u2019ve known enough women to know that women on the whole also want romantic relationships, if the success of love and deepspace is any indication at all.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve done is taken intimacy and commoditized it.

It\u2019s true that the women\u2019s domestic violence shelters of Alberta (where Mr. Silverman\u2019s shelter was) were founded and funded because it was a time where men were the income earners, meaning women had no means to escape by themselves or with their children. It took over a decade of organizing for the first domestic violence shelter to open in 1980, and the women who led the charge were ridiculed; this was a time when victims were told to just go home and reconcile more than anything. \n\n\nWhat Mr. Silverman experienced in terms of hardship in starting his shelter was not unique; funding, community support, being taken seriously, threats, etc. were all experienced by the founders of the original DV shelters. It\u2019s sad that his story ended the way it did - unfortunately, he did not have the community support he needed to garner the financial support of provincial and federal governments. Personally, although I don\u2019t agree with how he framed the issues (more his opinion than fact), I am always an advocate for more supports to be available.

{"text": "A quick stat I learned in sociology: 2/3s of labour done in the world is unpaid labour. And 2/3s of unpaid labour is done by women. \n\nThen of course there\u2019s the gender income gap,  which is absolutely dwarfed by the gender wealth gap. \n\nSo I find it fascinating how often these debates descend into complaints that women aren\u2019t doing all the volunteering for men\u2019s rights advocacy like they do for women\u2019s rights advocacy. Like literally the complaint is that women aren\u2019t taking on all the unpaid labour of advocacy volunteering for men too. \n\nI\u2019ll grant it\u2019s possible that some complainers are simply unaware of the history of women\u2019s refuges etc, that the vast majority were built by women volunteering unpaid labour.. but it seems to require conscious obliviousness to ignore the widespread imbalance of expectations of unpaid labour, particularly in any caring fields.. \n\nBut anyway I tried. After growing up fatherless, and becoming a single mum myself I threw myself into volunteering for the fatherhood project, all about supporting and empowering men into healthy fatherhood etc. yep they loved having a woman they could dump the unpaid labour onto, and yet still found ways to blame women for every single problem in their lives. \n\nMy absolute favourite was a panel discussion in which the entire panel concluded that when new mothers warn new fathers that they need to support newborn babies necks when they first hold them, they are actively preventing the father from ever agreeing to hold the baby again. So if men refuse to care for their own babies it\u2019s the mums fault for not letting them ignorantly injure the baby, for daring to give important information instead of letting the father find out the hard way, through injury to the child. I walked away stunned at how fragile mens egos must be, I\u2019ve been given unwanted instructions all my life and never used it as an excuse to abrogate my responsibilities. I guess it\u2019s just the first time some men ever experience the unwanted instructions phenomenon or something? \n\nI walked away from those few years of volunteering feeling quite educated in what the term male privilege means. \n\nAnd thus tried really hard to explain to my son the difference in experiences and how intersectionality actually works, including class, wealth, neurodivergence, even things like growing up with 1 parent vs 2, or with a close extended family vs an isolated nuclear family, etc in addition to gender. We both try to focus on having compassion and awareness of the complexity of intersectionality - and he tries to convince me to do a lot less unpaid labour for various advocacy causes lol (Gen z seem to understand self care a lot better than us Gen x)", "label": 0}

More on that in a moment, but at most I\u2019d say that I think women tend to be choosier in terms of finding partners anecdotally; ultimately though it\u2019s a bit of a pointless quibble. Actually, if at any point I said that men have it harder in the dating world I would like to retract that statement, because I don\u2019t really believe that it\u2019s that much easier for women, at least not in a major way.\n\nWhat I *do* believe, however \u2014 and there is evidence for this \u2014 is that women are more resilient than men when it comes to handling loneliness.

The rate of male suicide would also indicate this, to an extent, though there are many confounding factors on both sides. \n\nAnyways, to bring back the tangent \u2014 I don\u2019t think that men are necessarily worse off in the dating market, only more vulnerable to loneliness, which would be a possible explanation for why the current progressive culture that is feminism-lead tends to discount dating problems. \n\nBut the solution is one that helps *everyone*. Men and women are in this hole together \u2014 we\u2019re all lonelier, we all have less friends, and we\u2019re all finding it harder to get a partner(s, if that\u2019s your thing.)

Yes, having to reboot for updates is a pain, but the reason that they do this is precisely because they were making it simple for users so that they don't have to manually install service packs like in the bad old days. Dependency hell is pretty much a thing of the past and everybody makes installers for their software that handle all this.

{"text": "You\u2019re right, sometimes people can be shitty. They are coming from places that make them react the way they do and it\u2019s not always beneficial but this isn\u2019t a political issue to me, I\u2019ve dealt with this from men who were conservatives as well. \n\nOne thing I see Conservatives fail to understand is what people mean when someone is inherently privileged and the statistics behind it. You fail to see the forest for the trees, you want your personal problem to be focused on when the point of the argument is looking at it from a societal issue. Inherently privileged doesn\u2019t mean ALL men have a higher floor than women, it means on average there are situations where men see benefits that women don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like that then you\u2019re the issue. Not that you are necessarily rude about it but ignorance to it doesn\u2019t defer blame. I\u2019m a white dude who has benefited from being a white dude. Another thing Conservative men get wrong is thinking it needs to be more than recognizing that. Apparently it\u2019s too hard to acknowledge that and they need to fight it. \n\nAnother thing with this idea of averages is that men can still have issues that get worse even if they have more\nPrivileges. Like you said, things to do with kids can be in the womans favor but it\u2019s not like I see you with an example, it\u2019s usually always just this hypothetical situation to get mad at. You probably don\u2019t even know the statistics behind it. \n\nGoing back to my PRIDE example, my point is that I\u2019ve never dealt with someone in any lefty social event give me shit when I was having a productive and positive conversation that discussed mens issues. The only times I\u2019ve ever really seen it were when the person arguing for the men wasn\u2019t even trying to educate people they just wanted to argue.

{"text": ">It\u2019s fine for people to view one woman\u2019s actions and then view her differently based on those actions. It\u2019s a completely other thing to view one woman\u2019s actions and then view women, as a whole, differently. \n\n>It\u2019s the difference between seeing one woman do something terrible and going \u201cthat woman sucks\u201d and \u201cthis is why women suck\u201d.\n\nAlthough I agree it's wrong to attribute negative characteristics onto women generally because of one individual woman (i.e. it's bigoted, prejudiced and unfair), viewing a group differently because of the actions of an individual is often unavoidable. You incorporate the actions of that individual into a set of actions demonstrated by that group. (To be clear, not all of these attributed behaviors are necessarily negative.)\n\nI think we could agree that's what we're dealing with in the \"man vs bear\" comparisons. Women are making an informed, rational decision based on the range of possible actions a man could take (I.e. including violent action). As you say, the dangerous ones are a small sub-set, but they are an important part of the risk profile you're assessing.\n\n>It\u2019s not about judging all men as violent all the time. It\u2019s about knowing the possibility of a man being violent when I am in a vulnerable position and acting accordingly just in case.\n\nI agree it's not about judging everyone in the group as the same. It's about building an accurate profile to strategize around. Men tend to emphasize the social, financial and emotional risks of modern dating, and they likewise build risk profiles and make rational decisions based on them. (Which isn't to excuse any misogyny or unfair attribution of negative behavior onto women who haven't done them any harm.)\n\n>But someone just choosing to be in a type of relationship that they want to be in, while not expecting that of anyone else or thinking it\u2019s inherent to womanhood, is not perpetuating the patriarchy.\n\nI don't know if I can agree with that statement, but it mind depend on how we define patriarchy. I tend to interpret it as a set of traditional social values that presuppose male dominance and hierarchy. If a woman supports a hierarchical relationship, I don't see how that couldn't be perpetuating patriarchy.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm all on board with the idea that the individual mindset is fundamentally the wrong way to see the world. There are plenty of systemic features of the issue that require systemic solutions. But, at the same time, the fundamental problem is that people eat a bunch meat and want to keep doing so. You aren't going to change the situation until you can begin to change those attitudes. And I just don't see a world in which that happens through some \"invisible rejection\" of meat in which people don't do anything different while waiting for some critical mass of similar people. The are many fronts for progress here, but convincing people the issue exists is step 0 in virtually every single one of them. You can be as pessimistic as you want about what the chance for success is for reaching people, but the \"let's wait and see when it's time to do something\" approach seems to me like it can only have far poorer odds. What message do you even send to those around you by being silently disapproving of the meat industry? How convincing could you even be to others when you haven't taken the basic step of aligning your diet with that position?\n\nI also don't buy the degree of skepticism about the direct impact of abstaining. A significant percentage of the population of the US is now vegetarian/vegan. I understand that the economics of production are not a simple 1-1 thing, but the collective effect of that lack of consumption has surely contributes to less production. And that's not just potentially progress towards a better system, as the infrastructure and demand for non-animal based foods has been built up by that context, but it's literally lives saved from an existence abject torture. The more adoption rises, the larger this impact will be. Even in the case where some full and total change doesn't come, a drop by 5% or 10% to demand translates over time to the avoidance of unimaginable amounts of suffering.\n\nLastly, the idea that people will, to any degree or number, be unwilling to change their own diet but also be willing to join into a concerted effort to fight for animal welfare in the form of mass organizing is just on its face totally implausible to me. Maybe you are, I don't know you, and I'm not accusing you of lying. But you would be an aberration in that case. Many more would sooner just continue to not care, or pay lip service to the issue being a tragedy, but would certainly not step up to interrupt their own supply of food. This is fundamentally a **cultural** issue as much as a systemic one.   \n  \nCultural change can of course be approached and thought about in a systemic light as well, but you aren't going to change the culture around food if you act like just not eating meat takes so much \"energy\" that it's some unreasonable request to make of those who do see the issue already. You aren't going to convince people, or more likely even bring the issue to their mind, if you order the same 2lb steak that everyone else you're eating with does. You change culture by normalizing alternatives and by getting people to face the failures of existing ones. I don't see how your vision translates into that in any realistic case.", "label": 0}

Funding can not be appropriately allocated if we do not know who is where, ergo even if the national taxes are higher that only really benefits the states and areas that aren't dealing with these people. For those living on border states, I assume this is the biggest reason.\n\n(2) Many feel that permitting illegals makes the entire legal process worthless and that it's a slap in the face for those who actually had to go through the entire process [it is.] Additionally, if you don't know whose coming through this does open up a security risk (both safety wise and health wise.)\n\n(3) Immigrants tend to dislike illegal immigrants because immigration [legal and otherwise] has the most notable effect of reducing the wages and demand of immigrants. \n\nI'm sure I'm missing others, but this is what immediately springs to mind from conversations I've had.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">Although I agree it\u2019s wrong to attribute negative characteristics onto women generally because of one individual woman (i.e. it\u2019s bigoted, prejudiced and unfair), viewing a group differently because of the actions of an individual is often unavoidable. You incorporate the actions of that individual into a set of actions demonstrated by that group. (To be clear, not all of these attributed behaviors are necessarily negative.)\n\nWhy is this unavoidable? If that was the case wouldn\u2019t I think all men were violent criminals just waiting to rape me? I clearly am able to separate the bad actions of a few members of a group from the rest of that group, so I don\u2019t see how it would be unavoidable for other people to do the same.\n\nSure some people might be bigoted and see one woman acting a certain way and decide all women suck. But not everyone is a misogynist, so clearly people can and do separate the actions of singular women from the group as a whole. And if people do already do that, why is it on all of womankind to act perfectly just because some people are bigots? Why do I have to change the way I act to make misogynists hate women less?\n\n>I think we could agree that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with in the \u201cman vs bear\u201d comparisons. Women are making an informed, rational decision based on the range of possible actions a man could take (I.e. including violent action). As you say, the dangerous ones are a small sub-set, but they are an important part of the risk profile you\u2019re assessing.\n\nBut I don\u2019t take the traits of rapist violent men and say \u201cthis is what all men are like\u201d, I just know that group exists. Why can\u2019t men do the same and see shitty women and think \u201csome people out of that group are bad people, even though most are not like that\u201d instead of \u201call women are bad and act like this.\u201d\n\n>I agree it\u2019s not about judging everyone in the group as the same. It\u2019s about building an accurate profile to strategize around. Men tend to emphasize the social, financial and emotional risks of modern dating, and they likewise build risk profiles and make rational decisions based on them. (Which isn\u2019t to excuse any misogyny or unfair attribution of negative behavior onto women who haven\u2019t done them any harm.)\n\nExactly, men are allowed to acknowledge the fact that some women would make poor partners. Where it becomes misogynistic is when they act like the actions of that group of people are inherent to being a woman, or that all women act like that.\n\n>I don\u2019t know if I can agree with that statement, but it mind depend on how we define patriarchy. I tend to interpret it as a set of traditional social values that presuppose male dominance and hierarchy. If a woman supports a hierarchical relationship, I don\u2019t see how that couldn\u2019t be perpetuating patriarchy.\n\nSo if I wear the color pink, an I perpetuating the patriarchy because some men think pink is a \u201cgirl color\u201d? I shouldn\u2019t bring up too many points in a meeting because men might see that and think all women talk too much? \n\nSome men might see me dressing immodestly and think \u201call women are sluts\u201d. Other men might see me dressing modestly and think \u201call women are prudes.\u201d So how am I supposed to dress if no matter what I\u2019m perpetuating sexist stereotypes?\n\nWhy is it on me to dress and act and date and live in the \u201cright\u201d ways that possibly might make misogynists hate women a little less? Why does \u201cfighting the patriarchy\u201d mean pleasing misogynistic men by acting in the way they deem to be \u201ccorrect\u201d, lest they hate all women?", "label": 0}

{"text": "\"The number of women serving extreme sentences in the United States has increased sharply in the last decade, a September 2021 report by a collaborative of criminal law reform organizations has found.\n\nThe report, In The Extreme: Women Serving Life Without Parole and Death Sentences in the United States, released September 22 by The Sentencing Project, the National Black Women\u2019s Justice Institute, and the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide, determined that the number of women serving sentences of life without possibility of parole soared 43% between 2008 and 2020, far outpacing the overall 2% increase in women imprisoned for violent crime during that time. The increase in death-in-prison sentences for women was nearly 1.5 times greater than the 29% increase in life without parole sentences for men in the same time frame.\n\n\u201cThe number of women serving life without parole has increased substantially and faster than men serving life without parole,\u201d \n\nAnalyzed data on the more than 6,600 women serving sentences of life without parole and the 52 women on death row in the United States today. Found that death sentences peaked for women in 1990 and have declined in the years since, after life without parole became a more widely available sentencing alternative. Death-in-prison sentences for women peaked in 2013 and have declined in the following years but, the report notes, the total number of women serving sentences of life without parole continues to rise.\n\nThe report noted a correlation between heavy usage of life without parole sentencing and capital sentencing, finding that states with a high number of women serving life without parole sentences that authorize the death penalty also have at least one woman on death row. Florida has the most women serving life without parole, with 241 imprisoned, and averaged an \u201calarming\u201d 11 life without parole sentences per year during the period studied. Pennsylvania and California followed with 193 and 179 women serving death in prison sentences, respectively.\n\nThe report finds that the disproportionate growth of extreme sentencing for women is attributable, at least in part, to \u201cgender-based stigma and bias that negatively affects [women\u2019s] court outcomes.\u201d", "label": 0}

{"text": "TLDR// the first movie is decent, second and third one are incoherent\n..\nIn my opinion, the only one with seemingly a coherent vision is the first one. The premise of a mysterious silent clown killing people for some mysterious reason actually doesnt seem like a bad idea. I love how there is comedic expressions from him, and if they had kept it as a comedic slasher i think the series would have been SO much better. The problem is the second one though. In the second one they begin to add \u201cdeep mysterious lore\u201d (my theory is because ones properties become popular of coure you need lore for some reason). I honestly feel the lore ruins the movies, it makes NO sense and is so obviously shoe-horned in. Like i said, a movie about a mysterious silent clown killing people for what appears to be just for fun is so much more interesting than whatever happens in the second one. The third one, i dont even know how to describe it other than garbage tbh \ud83d\ude2d it somehow does the second one worse than the second one. You ask how its different from the second one, but i think a better question is how the second and third are different from the first. Although the first is still incredibly corny (probably bc of its low budget) at least you had an idea of what was going on, second and third one i genuinely could not tell you the plot if i tried.", "label": 0}

Ignoring or understating the areas of society where men are disadvantaged or actively discriminated against is one of the factors radicalizing young men to the right.

I don't think people want to recognize that we are all trapped in the same system and it negatively affects all of us. \n\nI am a woman, but I can easily imagine how a young boy would feel about a lot of the rhetoric in the online left.

{"text": "There is a systematic issue that I don't see anyone bringing up. The lack of male role models for young boys in elementary school. \n\nWe, as a society, stigmatize men who work with young kids, which drives men away from the industry, while utterly ignoring the fact that those young boys need adult men to look up to, too.\n\nA lot of boys spend their prepubescent life with significantly less healthy role models when compared to girls. \n\nAdd to that that the young boys are developing their gross motor muscles at a time while their girl peers are developing their fine motor muscles, makes it harder for the boys to sit still while also struggling to learn how to use a pencil. This results in boys getting in trouble more often. The person disciplining the boys tends to be an adult woman. Elementary education being so dominated by women unintentionally starts to begin being made for girls more than boys. \n\nEffectively, we create a negative feedback loop where boys feel rejected by a system they don't understand and act in a way to eject the system further. \n\nHonestly, a very, very simple fix would be for a greater push for men to be elementary teachers. Which, ironically, in that environment, men effectively would be the DEI hire.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">To be clear, I am not claiming that we inevitably view every individual in the group differently, but that we view the group itself differently. Those are two very different things. Besides, it\u2019s not possible to view every individual in the group based on the attributes of this-or-that member because people have mutually-exclusive characteristics.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying that you can somehow think women as a group deserve to be kept in subservient housewife role where they don\u2019t contribute financially and the man is responsible for the finances, yet those views don\u2019t carry over at all to the actual women who they interact with in real life? Huh?\n\n\n>I get what you\u2019re saying, but we\u2019re not saying women need to alter their behavior to disprove misogyny. We\u2019re saying they need to reject patriarchy because that\u2019s a feminist position. It\u2019s not sufficient to reject patriarchy when men perpetuate it. (That\u2019s the argument anyway.)\n\nHow is wanting a certain type of relationship \u201cperpetuating the patriarchy\u201d? It\u2019s just one woman deciding for herself her dating preferences, everyone\u2019s allowed to have dating preferences. The part that perpetuates the patriarchy is if she would claim that all women inherently want that type of relationship or that this style of relationship is the only \u201ccorrect\u201d one for a woman to have.\n\nJust knowing what kind of relationship you want and meeting someone who shares that same desire is not perpetuating the patriarchy. Even if other people see her in that relationship and it reenforces misogynistic thinking in them, that would be *them* perpetuating the patriarchy, not her.\n\n>I think you and I agree that people should be treated like individuals who make their own choices, even as we can observe the group at large.\n\nYes, which is why people should be able to look at a woman not contributing financially to her relationship and be able to interpret that is a trait of that woman and not *all women as a whole*. \n\n>I think you rightly point out that you can\u2019t satisfy misogynists because their angles of attack are contradictory. But again, I haven\u2019t said feminists need to satisfy misogynists. They do need to reject patriarchy, which is not the same thing.\n\nThis goes back to my pink example: The patriarchy says that pink is a color for girls and shouldn\u2019t be worn by boys because it\u2019s \u201cgay\u201d, yet a woman who wears pink isn\u2019t perpetuating the patriarchy. If people see her wearing pink and it reenforces the misogynistic idea that pink is for girls, that still wouldn\u2019t be her perpetuating the patriarchy.\n\n>So if a woman says, \u201cWe make equal wages, but I want you to pay for the date,\u201d that\u2019s perpetuating patriarchy. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t trying to change anyone\u2019s mind over to the patriarchal idea that \u201creal men\u201d pay for women\u2019s bills because they are providers. Then no, she isn\u2019t perpetuating the patriarchy, she\u2019s just discussing the type of relationship she\u2019d like to have.\n\nIf I go on a date and say that I want children, even though that contributes to the patriarchal idea that women should be maternal and desire to have children, that still wouldn\u2019t be me perpetuating the patriarchy until I started saying \u201cOf course I want children, you know how us women are\u201d or \u201cA woman who doesn\u2019t have kids is just denying her true nature.\u201d But just wanting to have a relationship that includes children, and communicating that to your potential partner is not perpetuating the patriarchy, even if the relationship type is one that plays into sexist stereotypes.\n\n>Men used to offer financial resources to women because men earned, controlled and retained wealth directly. Feminists who hold men to these standards are effectively double-dipping, getting the downstream benefits of patriarchy and feminism.\n\nThe results of feminism aren\u2019t a \u201creward\u201d that has given us some extra benefits. We are trying to take our gender up to *baseline*. Getting to vote. Getting to work outside the home. Getting to have our own bank accounts. Not being legally raped by our husbands we were forced to marry because we can\u2019t even own our own property. Those aren\u2019t \u201cprivileges\u201d we get to have now. It\u2019s the bare minimum of treating us an equal human beings.\n\nSo we aren\u2019t getting \u201cbenefits\u201d from feminism, we are finally starting to be treated with basic respect.", "label": 0}
