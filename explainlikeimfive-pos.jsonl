That was a big deal compared to tempera, which dries super fast.", "label": 1}

Guessing the Likelihood: You think regular lemonade will sell more, so you decide to make the strawberry lemonade cheaper to make it more tempting. This way, people are split between buying regular and strawberry.\n\n\n2. Adding Your Profit: You don\u2019t sell each lemonade for just the cost of making it; you add a little extra so that, no matter which lemonade people pick, you\u2019re making some money. This little extra is your \"profit.\"\n\n\n3. Adjusting Prices: If too many people start buying regular lemonade, you raise its price a bit, or maybe lower the price of strawberry again. This helps balance things so people are buying both, and you\u2019re not risking running out of one type too fast.\n\n\n\nIn short, oddsmakers do something similar: they set numbers to get people to bet on both teams, adjust if one team is getting more bets, and add a bit extra so they\u2019re always making a profit no matter which team wins.", "label": 1}

Along the way, he meets Utnapishtim, a character who survived a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity\u2014a flood story that is strikingly similar to the biblical Noah\u2019s Ark. This \u201cend of the world\u201d moment in Gilgamesh, with its catastrophic flood, speaks to fears of humanity being wiped out and to questions about what makes life meaningful in the face of inevitable death.\n\nSo, when people think about apocalyptic scenarios today, they see parallels in Gilgamesh: survival, the hope to endure, and the quest for purpose even when facing the end. The story reminds us that these fears and themes have been with humanity for millennia, giving it a timeless resonance in any discussion about the apocalypse.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I used to order ingredients for a Pizza Place. We had a system to tracked all our sales since the store was open and used those numbers to predict future sales. This system would then suggest what I should order for the restaurant each week.\n\nThe system was pretty good but it had some flaws. \n\nFirst, it couldn't account for employee theft. The system can only track what gets entered so if I had employees making and taking home pizzas without ringing them up then the system would think those ingredients are still there and thus not account for replacing them.\n\nSecond, it relied on standard serving sizes. We had specific measurements for everything. Large pizzas get this cup of cheese. One topping pepperonis gets x pepperonis, 2 topping gets Y pepperonis, etc. The system didn't factor in error for when employees didn't follow the standards. So we might use more than the system accounted for which results in it suggesting we order less than we'd need.\n\nFinally, the system had no context of non-standard world events. It would predict we'd sell less around times like Thanksgiving, but it had no idea when things like a hot movie were coming out (driving sales up because we were close to the theater). \n\n\nSo the system was useful but it still required some analysis to know when to bump the numbers up a bit more.", "label": 1}

{"text": "An algorithm is when a programmer defines a set of rules that are automatically applied to a data set by a computer. You will hear it often in context with social media.

So they want to show you only the ones you most likely will have interest in by default.\n\nThere are many different technical ways to define those instructions. Some more modern ones include so called \"machine learning\" or \"AI\".\n\nThe more problematic issue with \"algorithms\" is not so much the technology. Algorithms in themselves are not good or bad. They just do a job a software developer programmed them to do. The issue is that e.g. Facebook (and others) continue to tweak their algorithms. Their goal is to make you like posts and share them as much as possible. Sadly they found out that posts that anger you are more likely to get a comment or share from you. This can lead an algorithm to be designed to show you more content that angers you, to drive engagement. Sadly that can have severe side effects that have nothing to do with technology.

{"text": "As a city planner, I can explain the American reasonings behind this type of (bad) design; maybe it'll also apply on your side of the pond?\n\n\nThere's a mix of a few things at play here:\n\n\n\n* Some architects and planners in the early/mid 20th century tried to work with nature, making roads follow natural contours and features rather than just forcing grids on top of everything. These were usually high status figures like Frank Lloyd Wright, and so other developers began to imitate their curvy street plans even on flat ground where there wasn't any natural topography to work around.\n\n\n* People decided at some point that their entire neighborhood should be private space, and others shouldn't use it even to walk through. Confusing and disconnected street and walkway networks were marketed as a way to keep \"others\" out.\n\n\n* Lack of good planning by local governments -- making a development connect well to what's already there and also provide opportunities for the next future development to connect well requires that the local government have good plans and regulations pushing these things. It's easier to just say \"you can connect to the main road at this point here, and then the rest of your development is an island that doesn't have to connect to anything around it.\"\n\n\n* Homogeneity / sameness - large-scale developers often just do the same thing over and over again. Even if the roads don't have to curve to follow the land, curvy streets are part of their practice and brand. Even if you personally don't value exclusion of others, too bad, they're marketing that as a feature whether you want it or not. Even if the local government wants connectivity, the developers want to come in with the same disconnected site plan they've done in ten other places: connecting with the surrounding context makes copy/paste harder.", "label": 1}

Or 3, or 494, \n\nEvery possible segment has its own unique number\n\nImagine let's say you have Shazam listen to your song,\n\nIt takes in five segments\n\nEach one is used to trigger a search in the database. The same approach can be used to create the keys we use to then perform the search\n\nNow imagine your database is a gigantic book with a trillion pages  with each page pointing to a unique segment\n\nThe page numbers match that unique number we were talking about.\n\nSo all we have to do is browse to the right page right?\n\nThat might potentially take ages right with a trillion pages \n\nNot so if we remember how fast modern computers are.\n\nThere are also optimisations that can be made to the search\n\nA quick way of explaining is imagine we want to find a page in a dictionary for giraffe\n\nTo start we open the page right in the middle and ask is giraffe before or after the middle\n\nIf the answer is before then giraffe must be in the first half which is obvious because the middle of the dictionary will be around the letter j\n\nOkay so what now we'll we repeat the process again looking at the middle of the first half of the dictionary again asking the question whether it's higher or lower\n\nThis time it's higher, okay we need to repeat the process for the second quarter.\n\nThese comparisons continue until we've reach the correct page and then the correct word\n\nIf we go back to the book with a trillion pages the same process is applied using the order of page numbers  instead\n\nSo let's say your key is just below half a trillion, well you'll look at the first half, second quarter and so on until you land on the page\n\nWhy do this? Well if you think about it the number of comparisons we make falls down to the number of times you can divide a trillion by 2\n\nThis works out to be around 20 times so your computer just has to perform 20 comparisons which makes this search super quick.\n\nOkay so let's say we find the correct page for the segment what's next?\n\nWell the pages for each segment will have the info of the song the segment comes from \n\nAll your application needs to do at that point is follow the link and feed back the information to the client\n\nThat's it or at least how I'd implement a basic version of it.\n\nI bet Shazam has some next level stuff because they have to deal with the challenge of serving responses to millions of requests a second", "label": 1}

You provide access to activities that allow the child to participate in self-directed learning.\n\nFor example, you know those bead and string sets, well in Montessori you'd show the child the set and observe how they choose to play with it. Maybe they'll thread the beads onto the string, or maybe they'll sort the beads by shape or colour, maybe they'll throw the beads at their sister and blame it on the dog. Either way, you observe the behaviour and you encourage the good things they're doing. You don't force them to do things one way.\n\nIt makes more sense in a group setting, where traditionally kids are encouraged and often forced to behave and interact in a uniform and proscribed fashion. To go back to the beads and string example, making all of the kids thread their beads in a specific pattern to teach them fine motor and pattern recognition skills. Montessori developed as a counter to that style of learning.\"", "label": 1}

Emphasis on Individual Responsibility: There is a strong focus on personal accountability, where individuals are expected to own up to their actions.\n\n\n3. Legal Systems Based on Justice and Fairness: Laws are designed to reflect moral principles, and justice systems aim to uphold individual rights and equitable treatment.\n\n\n4. Value of Confession and Redemption: Societal norms encourage admitting wrongdoing and seeking forgiveness to alleviate feelings of guilt.\n\n\n5. Privacy of Transgressions: Wrongdoings are often considered private matters between the individual and their conscience or deity, rather than public concerns.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nIndicators of Shame Cultures:\n\n1. Importance of Social Reputation and Honor: Maintaining one's image in the eyes of the community is paramount, and social standing influences behavior.\n\n\n2. Collectivist Orientation: The needs and norms of the group take precedence over individual desires, promoting conformity.\n\n\n3. Public Acknowledgment of Wrongdoing: Deviations from norms are often addressed publicly, and shame is used as a deterrent against nonconformity.\n\n\n4. Face-saving Behaviors: Individuals engage in actions to preserve dignity and avoid embarrassment for themselves and others.\n\n\n5. Use of Indirect Communication: Messages are often conveyed subtly to prevent causing offense or shame, emphasizing harmony over confrontation.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nIndicators of Fear Cultures:\n\n1. Belief in Punitive External Forces: There is a strong conviction that deities, spirits, or authorities will impose punishment for wrongdoing.\n\n\n2. Strict Obedience to Authority: Compliance with rules and directives from leaders or institutions is expected to avoid negative consequences.\n\n\n3. Prevalence of Physical Punishment: Corporal punishment and harsh penalties are commonly used to enforce norms and deter deviance.\n\n\n4. Superstitious Practices and Rituals: Rituals are performed to appease supernatural forces or prevent misfortune, reflecting a fear of unknown powers.\n\n\n5. Rule Compliance Driven by Fear: Adherence to societal rules is motivated by the anticipation of punishment rather than personal conviction or concern for reputation.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nUnderstanding these cultural frameworks helps in appreciating the diversity of societal norms and the various mechanisms through which social order is maintained around the world. It's important to note that many societies may exhibit a combination of these indicators rather than fitting neatly into a single category.\"", "label": 1}

{"text": "* **Using a Center Finder**: Place the steel cylinder between centers on a lathe or on a fixture that allows it to rotate. Then use a center finder tool, which is like a fine-pointed tool, to make small adjustments until the cylinder spins as smoothly as possible without wobbling. This will approximate the true center even if the outer surface isn\u2019t perfectly round.\n* **Marking with Dividers**: For rough center-finding, a set of dividers or calipers can be helpful. Adjust the divider to the approximate radius of the cylinder and make multiple marks from different points around the circumference. The point where the marks converge or overlap will be close to the center.\n* **Using a Lathe Chuck and Dial Indicator**: Mount the cylinder in a lathe chuck, then bring a dial indicator to measure runout on the outer surface. Slowly rotate the cylinder and watch the dial indicator; adjust the position in the chuck until the dial reading is as consistent as possible, indicating that the cylinder is centered as closely as possible.\n* **Surface Plate and Height Gauge**: Place the cylinder on a flat surface plate, then use a height gauge to measure and mark the approximate midpoints from different sides. This method isn\u2019t as precise but can give a reasonable estimate for rough work.\n* **Turning Between Centers**: After roughly finding the center, you can drill shallow center holes on each end of the cylinder. Then, mount it between centers on the lathe, allowing for adjustments to remove wobble during the turning process. The centers provide a pivot point, and even if the outside isn\u2019t perfect, the workpiece will rotate evenly on its true center axis.\n\n\\-ChatGPT", "label": 1}

{"text": "Analogy: Finding the next biggest prime number like **hiking an endless mountain range with random peaks**:\n\n**The Proof:** We know there\u2019s always a higher peak (a larger prime) somewhre in this range. We just don't know where or how high it will be. But it must be there *because* the range goes on forever.\n\n**The Gaps:** The first peaks (small primes) were easy to find because they are close together. But as we go higher, the distance between peaks grows. The gaps are enormous now.\n\n**The Testing Challenge:** Each peak we want to reach takes more work to climb. For huge peaks (massive numbers), it\u2019s like the slopes get steeper and rockier, so it takes a lot of strength (computing power) to reach the top and verify if it\u2019s really a peak (a prime).\n\nWe know they exist, but finding each new tallest peak is a huge effort, and it only gets harder the higher we go!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I lost both parents and both my inlaws from old age and cancer, and around 5 other family members.\n\nMost of the time people are already so bedridden, that they will be wearing adult diapers, which catches whatever fluids people will lose when they pass.  \nDeath isn't like in the movies, it isn't pretty. But you get used to it, even though that sounds weird, because you kind of know what to expect.\n\nPeople that pass don't always lose their bowels, but will mostly lose their bladder contents, because the bladder is like a muscle that is constantly working. That's how you pee, by relaxing the musclebladder. That muscle relaxes in the same way when someone passes.\n\nAlso, you will probably be so overcome with sadness, that you don't care what is happening. Dying people, can vomit, bleed, pee and poo. It's part of being human. Most of the time there will be nurses to assist what whatever mess is there.  \nAnother thing that I want to mention, is that most dying people have had a long (or short) sickbed and especially with your parents, you will help them as age does its thing.  \nYiou get used to the little accidents, wounds and sickness and everything that comes with it. By the times a parent passes, you will have seen it all and whatever happens on their deathbed, will probably not phase you anymore.", "label": 1}
