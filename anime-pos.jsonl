What if Sanji's siblings were copies of him to be more specific, they are seraphim? That is why they were bullying him, they were jealous. Sanji the weakest and the original who had will, hope, ambitions, dreams, and most importantly feelings. Which also means that Reiju was somewhat of a failed experiment, instead of duplicating her she became a cyborg that is why she has feeling and that is why Sanji wanted to save his sister on WCI. If Sanji's mother didn't die because of an illness because when Usopp's mother died she appeared in the anime in a very ill state at the end of her day's which didn't happen with Sanji's mother. So, what if Sanji was the reason behind his mother's death? What if Sanji's pervert innate behavior comes out of a sense of guilt and it is an uncontrollable thing as he grows stronger which also suggests that Sanji might be mentally unstable? Maybe that is why he hit Luffy on WCI, he was afraid history would repeat itself, he would rather be a traitor than his captains' killer (besides all of that they were holding Judge as hostage). Why was Sanji placed in solitary confinement? If it was a form of punishment his father wouldn't have allowed the guards to bring cooking supplies or books unless Sanji's mother died because of him and ever since then Judge had become terrified of him? So, what actually happened? My theory suggests that Judge killed his own wife right before his son. Why did he do that? He did it for an experiment. When Sanji was born with no special powers Judge decided to never give up and turn him into a Lab Rate, his father kept giving him drugs but since Sanji has some demonic traits his body treated these drugs as poison and his body disposed of these drugs. When Judge realized what was going on and that his feelings trigger his powers he decides to kill his wife in front of his child. Sanji went bonkers and destroyed half of Germa Kingdom. In his battle with Queen Sanji at some point was standing before a destroyed building with the helmet on, this building was part of the Kingdom that he destroyed and got him placed in solitary confinement and these are the real abilities he is afraid of. What if Sanji can use what's called alchemy since we don't know from where his flames came. If it was really coming from his pation like he is saying then every patinate being will be able to use flames which is not the case and we saw that Shanks can also use flames and from where is Shanks? From the God Valley so what if this power is alchemy and Sora was the second survivor of the god valley besides shanks? We have seen that Sanji can reflect light which means that if alchemy can change an element into another then it can easily allow him to reflect light. Another thing that supports the presence of alchemy is Saturn he used weird circles to summon the others so what if that was alchemy not to mention that he was present in the God Valley incident. What if Zeff was killed, then history will repeat itself and Sanji will show his true nature. The scientist at Germa kingdom confirmed that Sanji doesn't have any genes as for losing his humanity is because he is partially demon the \"Diable Jambe\" or the \"Devil's leg\" who does the leg belong to? The devil AKA Sanji. So, if Zoro is \"king of Hell\" then Sanji \"King of Demons\". Why is Sanji a demon? What if people in the god valley used alchemy to summon demons from the underworld and through time these people started merging with the demons creating \"Demi-humans\" a demon soul with human form (THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL PEOPLE IN GOD VALLY CAN DO IT MAYBE A SPECIFIC FAMILY). This might explain a lot about the Tot Musica which was created out of people's loneliness or rather a person's loneliness after the Joyboy left the Tot Musica or its physical form was never accepted by people that they started torturing her until she killer herself, but her soul stayed for revenge from those who were the reason behind her death. Evidence, in Uta's first appearance in the show she was covering her left eye same as Sanji. Sanji and Uta are 21 years, they were both adopted by Zeff and Shanks. They both tried to protect Luffy in their OWN WAY. When Uta was 9 shanks left her, when Sanji was 9, he met Zeff. Uta who sang Tot Musica which is a demon is so similar to Sanji who has demonic abilities. And for those of you who aren't convinced yet, in Alabasta, Skypia, and Enies Lobby arcs Sanji was fatally injured yet stood up as if nothing who can you explain that. What if Germa Kingdom once ruled kindly and respectively over the North blue before the Void Century and they supported the Joyboy and lost their kingdom after a bloody war that lasted for 66 years in the Void Century. The Joyboy promised to return and aid them but never returned this could explain their current ruthlessness as a way to reclaim power without the Joyboy who they think betrayed them, which also suggests that before the final War Judge might die and Sanji will lead the Germa Kingdom under the rule of the Joyboy. This could also explain why Judge\u2019s family retains the title of royalty despite lacking a traditional Kingdom.\nI'd like to read everyone's opinion on this theory?", "label": 1}

{"text": "Here is a bit of description of that sequence in the light novel:\n\nThe massive bodies of the Dark Young trampled the Royal Army underfoot.\n\n Splinters from countless shattered spears flew through the air.\n\n Although they crushed the meaningless resistance that did not even count as resistance, the Dark Young of the Black Goat were merciful in their own way.\n\n There was no pain.\n\n There was no time for their victims to feel pain before they were squashed flat under the titanic weight of the Dark Young\u2019s charge.\n\n The spear-wielding soldiers did not even have time to realize that the pikes they were holding had been pulverized by those massive bodies. All they saw were black shadows falling over them.\n\n They screamed and they screamed and they screamed.\n\n Gobbets of meat flew through the air. They had not come from just one or two people, but tens, hundreds of victims. They were stamped flat by the enormous hooves, and thrown\u2014 no, flung away by the waving tentacles.\n\n Be they patricians or plebeians, now they were all the same chunks of bloody flesh.\n\n Some of them had families in their villages. Some had friends left behind. Some had people waiting for them. Once they were ground into the mud, none of that mattered any more.\n\n The Dark Young treated everyone the same way, bestowing death upon them all.\n\n Surely they must have been satisfied after crushing countless humans underfoot, but they showed no signs of stopping.\n\n The Dark Young began to run.\n\n They ran on. They did not stop while in the midst of the Kingdom\u2019s forces, simply running on.\n\n \u201cGyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d\n\n \u201cAbbaaaaaaahhhhhh!!\u201d\n\n \u201cStoooooooooooooop!\u201d\n\n \u201cSave meeeeeeeeeee!\u2019\n\n \u201cNoooooooooooooooo!\u201d\n\n \u201cUwaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!\u201d\n\n The screams rose up every time those gigantic hooves came down. It blended with the sound of humans pulping under the Dark Young\u2019s mighty legs, and the sound as they playfully batted humans away with their tentacles.\n\n A sound which men had never heard before went on and on without end.\n\n Trampled.\n\n What better word was there to describe this scene?\n\n Several people desperately thrust their pikes forward. The Dark Young, whose bodies were massive and who had no intention to evade the attacks, were hit solidly by the points. However, the pikes could not pierce deeply enough to cause harm to their slab-like bodies. They were masses of iron-hard muscle sheathed by thick, rubbery skin.\n\n The Dark Young did not mock their futile resistance, but simply charged forward.\n\n Before the soldiers realized that their fatal resolve was meaningless, the Dark Young had already reached the centermost portion of the Kingdom\u2019s army.\n\n \u201cRun away! Run away!\u201d\n\n They heard the shouts from the distance. In response, all the soldiers began to flee. It was exactly like a swarm of spiders scattering in all directions.\n\n But of course, the Dark Young were much faster than human beings.\n\n Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat.

Have they done things together - yes: where did I deny that? Idiot. That does not mean they are friends. They are at best partners, until they aren't. Similarly to coworkers who hang out casually but get a job done. That has always been Ishidas view on their relationship again for emphasis: in the story written by the writer, not based on your or my interpretation and the character has said this more than once and demonstrated thru his actions this is how he feels. Ichigos view that they are friends does not overwrite Ishidas feelings or point of view.\n\nDo you think Ishida was helping Ichigo for Ichigos sake? He was and is not. He worked with him for his own purposes, his own agenda. This has been said I'm verse too many times for you to simply ignore or forget it. Ishida has a grudging relationship with Ichigo, not forced by circumstances not based on friendship.\n\nIn this arc Ishida says outright, he is doing what he wants for his purposes and he does not stop to waste time on thinking Oh I am friends with these people I know and have worked with, no he participates in a plan of attack, an ambush, and a war knowing people will be killed. That is an escalation and participation in murder. Ishida at least shows his mettle his spine and his convictions. Ichigo does not.\n\nSo put that to bed.\n\nAs I point out: even if Ishida is playing at subterfuge it is poor writing because at this point without PIS, Plot Armor, and Hax Ichigo has lost and everyone should be dead. However the writer continues to rely on plot with no consequences, in part because this is not high literature, and as a writer he has weaknesses, which he has admitted.\n\nYes, you are a peak clown for overlooking what the story tells us explicitly and instead relying on your headcannon.\n\nPeace out.", "label": 1}

I haven't come across anyone discussing this but, is the main character 5 years younger then the romancable characters?\n\n\nQuick spoiler warning\n\n\nShe is ten when her bro joins and 15 is the age you are suppose to enter, so at a minimum everyone is is at least 5 years older then her, she comes to the academy at 13 and the prince teleports, corners and pretty much sexually harasses her for a moment in the library (he reaches into her dress boob area to check if she's wearing the necklace he gave her when she was even younger) so he's at a minimum 18 reaching into a 13 year Olds bra to kiss said necklace that was conceived between her boobs... beyond that it's a great story but that one scene is a lot even if it was played as romantic and heart thrombin I could not see it that way because it was the most predatory thing I've seen in a while from the genre of anime I usually watch and because of all the time jumping I don't think people have realized exactly what the context of that scene is because it's very creepy but it's so fast and thankfully she barley interacts with the prince but every time she does I get serious ick from him. Who chose those ages, it also doesn't make sense for the game she's in because she got in at 13 by breaking the game, how did the original villainess act as a villainess when she wouldn't even have been going to school with them??? And why would the heroine be so upset by a literal child harassing her, the kid sister of two romancable character no less to the point where if she marries the prince she gets this kid exiled.

She asks him for a favor, and he tries to freak her out by doing something weird, toothbrush scene happens, etc etc.\n\nThe actual contents of the scene feel like a joke that's either meant to shock or repulse you (as it did for me), but I think Nisioisin wanted them to reach a level of understanding by having them non-sexually breach the walls and boundaries they'd set and having them become closer as siblings. Of course though, Nisio is also kind of a pervert, so he slips in a \"it was almost sexual anyway\" in there. \n\nSo honestly, no it wasn't really necessary.

I also read but didn't watch claymore which has an anime only ending and isn't liked(considering I loved the ending, that's basically a no lol). I have criticisms and know others have criticisms of lots of these as adaptations too, but all the shonen I like has been manga which had terrible adaptations by shitty studios lmao so this isn't much of an ANIME recommendation just manga.\n\nOther things I feel the need to rant about: sigrdrifa was way too overhated considering it just has a slower first half but the climax in the second half was really meaningful imo. I'm quitting heroing should never get shit on for not saying \"Yeah this guy? He's programmed to become the enemy in times of peace so should just kill himself.\" The ending happened because he spent thousands of years worrying over his core programming to the point of sui but didn't realise that meant over that time he'd become sentient(ie able to switch OFF that programming). It wasn't a human having an off switch to save him from killing himself but a long suffering android learning he's become sentient through a millenium of trauma.\n\nAnd lastly, serial experiments lain is recognised as excellent for really stupid reasons, it's not another bloody anti escapism theme imo but pretty neutral about how both in person and online, we can lose our identities. People just treat it as the non-Anno evangelion, but it's...not? I mean don't get me started on arguments over Lain's mental illness. I don't really care about the somewhat related vn for that because the anime makes me think the other Lains represent her identity being distorted based on the Wired and the other characters' interactions with her through it, it has a character who looks like a literal anthropomorphised pornbot so how exactly is the weird stalker masturbating Lain a product of mental illness? It has nothing to do with the themes. I also loved the ending based on her finding happiness in a life where she's not human, it's kind of melancholy because sure her real family were all planted but she was never human either, so it's kind of fitting that she finds peace with a fictional Wired/electronic version of her father. Maybe compared with the human father that's a lie, but her living as human was also a lie so it's kind of a happy ending?\n\nBut maybe someday I'll read the Lain vn and realise my interpretation and life was a lie too lmao. I feel like having a different interpretation of it is good because of the creator expressing his disappointment in not managing to divide the american and japanese reception to the anime, even if I have no idea what he wanted us to think of it I feel like it wasn't just escapism=bad.", "label": 1}

It comes up in the LN sometimes and even the anime *where she thinks that kissing makes babies and Suberu has to explain to her that kissing won't make her pregnant.* \n\nAnyway.

{"text": "This might be a controversial take, but I'd say the only truly bad thing about the ending is how abruptly the final chapter concludes. There's no real epilogue after the penultimate climax. However, I think what 99% of people hate about the ending is the fact that the main character, Kiyoshi, gets absolutely blown the fuck out right as he's getting ready to confess to his love interest, Chiyomi. He's about to win it all, but instead he just gets body-bagged, and his love interest goes from being a kind and innocent girl to a man-hating feminazi like her older sister. But she's arguably justified at least to some degree considering what happens lol.\n\nLike, I can totally understand why people were so upset about it. Kiyoshi is presented as the underdog and you're constantly rooting for him to succeed throughout the series, even when he's doing arguably fucked up shit. But none of the characters aside from Chiyomi are truly innocent when you think about it. Prison School's setting being so utterly absurd and hyperbolic is what makes it so entertaining, and the ending perfectly embodies those things in my opinion.\n\nTo me, it's a manga that you should read for the journey, rather than the destination. It's insanely crude, illogical, and perverted, but it's one of the funniest god damn mangas out there because of that. The anime is even funnier and it's a shame that it never got another season.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Indeed. The message was that nobody is pure and innocent there, even Chiyo got corrupted. Trully an apt ending for a degenerate manga, I'm fine with how it ended even though I really shipped Kiyoshi and Hana. It's people's own fault for having different expectations that manga didn't follow through.\n\nWhat pissed *me* off was how Mari was just phased out abruptly...and that stupid and pointless Chairman adventure.", "label": 1}

For example tsunderes can be cute at first but it gets tiring in the long run, it just shows that the character is shallow and has no self awareness at all.\n\nThat's where Dandadan excels in. The author has a fair grasp of what a healthy and realistic relationship is. You do not spend days or weeks stone walling someone just because of an argument. Momo and Okarun had an argument at lunch time and they resolved it by the end of the school day, it also realistically portrays how some would agonize how to apologize like what Momo did.", "label": 1}

With that being said: \n\nI don't remember Bam becoming strong out of nowhere, but since there is a timeskip between season 1 and 2 that shouldn't be an issue anymore. \n\nI think Rachel betraying him is interesting and a plot point that I don't remember seeing a lot like this in battle shounen.

{"text": "Just what S1 did: cut, modify and rearrange the material into cohesive and purposeful episode units tracing defined steps towards a single well defined vision and end goal. \n\nThe primary complaint about this season is the animation but it's failure goes further than that. It feels like it's just going through the motions of the Manhwa. Events simply happen without much fanfare or punctuation, there isn't a sense of what the current Arc's purpose is, and thus no greater order that unifies each scene and episode. \n\nIn S1 that purpose was learning about what kind of place the Tower is. Obviously S2 can't just copy that because we're already done with it, it has to find something else. If I had to say it's should probably be about FUG and Bam's place and role in the Tower, about the political and cultural systems of the Tower or something like that.

{"text": "It's a bit absurd that they would get that good in a couple of months but there are a couple of things they explain in the novels that the anime kinda touches on but doesn't go into too much detail.\n\n1) Hajime spent all day using his spiders to dispel all the traps/magic around the palace. So most of the magic security was turned off without anyone noticing. They just had to deal with the guards who were expecting alarms to work that had been turned off.\n\n2) They're using radio earpieces to communicate. They're essentially the only faction in the world that has radios or even knows its a possibility. Can't overstate how massive an advantage that is for coordinating a complex op.\n\n3) They use bombs and stealth and techniques totally foreign to a world where people usually fight with swords and magic chants and such. In the books they actually start the fight with a flashbang then cut out the tongues of all the casters they down. I wouldn't say they fight like a modern military or anything because it's still anime physics with their jumping and somersaults etc but it's definitely closer to pragmatic anything goes fighting than the rest of the world does.\n\nThey just totally blindsided the empire with a revolutionary fighting style and technologies. They were taught to 'stack the deck' before the fight as much as possible so it was basically over before the fight started.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Explanation: Aria and Rio have magic swords, which increase one's physical ability beyond regular physical augmentation via magic. They also usually have special abilities. But they don't enhance your skill. They also use up a lot of magic power so if you don't have enough you get tired quickly.  Lastly, they're super rare in Strahl (the Europe-style region), so you need to be capable enough to be entrusted with one.\n\nIn Rio's case he's enhancing his body via spirit arts, so the physical ability enhancement from his sword is irrelevant. He's also using wind spirit arts while pretending the ability comes from his sword.", "label": 1}

What a wasted potential Dandadan is.\n\nAlso, after knowing that the artist of Rurouni Kenshin( Samurai X), Nobuhiro Watsuki got arrested for child pornography in 2017 by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, I fiercely avoided Manga artists and anime shows that sexually portray underaged MCs even if the plot seemingly demands it. Watsuki didn't even make sexualized characters but was actually a closet child porn user.  The Dandadan arist isn't even hiding the sexualization of teens.\n\nSexy anime isn't bad, but for goodness sake use adult characters. Why use teens and rape to tell a fictional story???

{"text": "Alright so get ready this will be a long one\u2026 [tower of god blogpost and skipped content spoilers] >!think of Shinsu as the perfect love child between nen and chakra\u2026 in the tower Shinsu is everything it\u2019s everywhere it\u2019s what you breathe it\u2019s life energy and it gets more concentrated and dense the higher the floor you go up in the tower\u2026 regulars have to make a contract with the administrator on each floor to gain permission to use shinsu, irregulars don\u2019t have too and can use it at will (why the administrator in season 1 said this will be a shackle for you) Now let\u2019s get into techniques and usages, everyone has a natural flow or current of Shinsu inside their body the technique you see bam use in the beginning of the season is called reverse flow control a ranker technique where you forcibly pour your own Shinsu into someone else reversing their flow and temporarily paralyzing them, there\u2019s also baangs\u2026 these are concentrated pockets of Shinsu skilled regulars and rankers can use that can fire shinsu offensively the amount of baangs used often shows the proficiency and skill of the user, it\u2019s why it was such a big deal that Baam was able to use 5 even though he was only on the 29th floor (skilled rankers can use hundreds), Shinsu also slows down aging the more proficient you are with it which is why age is complicated in the tower (ie: Endorsi is like 300) now let\u2019s get into properties and 10gf, now when you see people use lightning Shinsu or fire shinsu etc. that can be the result of 2 different things it can A. Be the element they have a natural affinity to (again think of shinsu like nen it is pure energy I can get deeper into this but it will be a spoiler for later on) or B.

{"text": "I haven't read the manga in a few years, but there was essentially 3 major arcs.\n\n* First year:  Tomoko is a loner who think the world is against her. Reality is that people around her are either caring, or are just going on with their day without paying attention as they should. That's what the anime covered, and it's mostly a collection of short skits where she slowly improve her behaviors. \n\n* Second year: Tomoko end up in a small group of a friends (forced pairing on a school trip). It's similar to the first part, but a bit more focussed. It goes through the awkwardness of meeting up people, and dealing with each other quirk. \n\n* Third year: They are preparing for college, and the various friends group in Tomoko's class intermingle a lot more. The story often shift perspective to other characters to address their issue. Tomoko is kind of at the center of the stage, but it follows the classes and their interaction with each other.\n\n\nPersonally, I liked the first two arcs a lot.

{"text": "The same applies to political parties though. Eventually the competent and well meaning party will be infested by corrupt and self-interested people, or another party that's much worse will be elected. \n\nAt least with a dictator you've got a competent leader for 40-60 years before having to worry about finding a replacement, while the political parties swap every 4 years, often undoing the work of the previous party if a new party gets in. Long term plans suffer while short term gains are prioritized because they can use that to brag about how good their term was, so they can hold onto power for another few years. A dictator can also select a successor, giving a much better chance of a good replacement, as long as they don't choose their own children. \n\nChildren raised by someone with supreme power, wealth and status, won't have any concept of actual hardship and they'll be removed from the world they're supposed to be living over, which makes for a poor ruler. Perhaps there'd be some success with a properly tutored child but I reckon you'd always be better off with a tutored candidate chosen from assistants, advisors and other prominent people near the dictator. \n\nThe line about the people having the right to violate the rights of the people is some clever rhetoric but totally wrong. \"The people\" were responsible for slavery in America, for example. \"The People\" is made up of multiple groups and it really just means the majority within the population. So the guy is arguing that the majority within a population has the right to remove the rights of people within the population. Which ultimately just results in the majority serving themselves while stepping on the minority. It's honestly an abhorrent argument. It's based in a stupidly simplistic idea of \"people can choose what to do with their own body, so lots of people can choose what to do with lots of people's bodies.\" and it just totally misses the fact that a body isn't conscious or made up of individuals that have wills and emotions, unlike The People.", "label": 1}

{"text": "For a while the majority of people in the democratic system maintained slavery. I don't care about the other colonies. I wasn't attacking America and saying the rest of the world is better, I was just using it as an example. \n\nA dictator could also have ordered the end of slavery. Like, again, there's just no argument for democracy here. None of these arguments are about democracy. They're just rhetoric that attributes qualities to democracy that democracy doesn't have. I can just as easily say that the murder of anyone killed by American weapons is also the result of democracy, so democracy is clearly evil. The use of nuclear weapons in WW2 were done at the behest of a democratic country so clearly democracies are all about mass destruction. They're just silly arguments. \n\nDemocracy is honestly a joke in the modern countries I know about. America has it's 2 party system and Britain is almost at a 2 party system too. There's barely any choice and people are voting tactically for parties they don't even want just because it isn't the other party they dislike more. At the head of these parties are oligarchies or even miniature dictatorships anyway. America is rotten with bribery, though I hear they call it lobbying, and the UK is full of corruption and incompetence. Neither government, regardless of whatever party is winning, is actually acting for the benefit of the people. They act to preserve their own wealth and to try to retain power. \n\nDo you genuinely see abortion bans as a reasonable step to take for the benefit of the people living in the US? I would say it's a great example of democracy failing the people. It's actively denying medical treatments that save lives. It's forcing accidental pregnancies to be carried to term by people who aren't ready and who maybe just got unlucky with the 1/100 failure rate of birth control, thereby forcing them and their new child into poverty.   \nFrankly, even if the majority of people did vote for that, it's still a failure of democracy. If the majority is going to make blatantly bad choices then it's clear that the vote of a majority simply isn't a good basis for policy. \n\nThere's a reason we have experts. Just like I wouldn't consider 50 random people the equivalent of a doctor when I need an illness diagnosed, I don't consider the general populace to be the equivalent of economic experts, philosophers, psychologists and medical experts when I need a country run competently.", "label": 1}
