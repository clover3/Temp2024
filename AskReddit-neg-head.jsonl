Two years later, she had another kid, covered by private insurance since my brother in law was no longer working for the state.  Cost about 28K, my sister and her husband had to pay a deductible of 2K.  Same hospital, same doctor, all the same but the insurance provider.  When  she asked why the bills were so different, she was told that the state audits insurance claims and private insurance doesn't.  They just bill a deductible and pay the difference.  The hospital puts whatever charges they can get away with on the bill.\n\nAsk for an itemized bill.  You'll see a huge difference.  I was presented with a bill for $800 for three stitches.  I asked for an itemized bill and 'medications' went from $350 to $18 for two extra strength tylenol.  Imaging went from $200 to an x-ray for $73.

{"text": "Our business involves going out a lot to shows and fair. The association and our own business has protection for weather damage as a lot of these venues are marquis outside.\n\nIn our earlier years, missing a show that would rake in \u00a3800 range could have quite possibly bankrupted us. So any protective insurance was a must. \n\nWe went out to one show that was beach side and the weather was predicted to be light rain and some wind. After setting up the Friday night we went back to our caravan and the weather turned horrendous. We didn't realise just how bad until the next day turning up at the venue. \n\nTo set the scene right\n\nStill storming, torrential rain fall, gale force winds. All the support ropes had been yanked from the ground or ripped in two. Some still had the metal anchors in that were driven over a meter into the ground. And they were flailing in the wind like it was nothing. They had that cliche whip crack sound effect but amplified 100 fold. One dude tried to reverse his landrover into marquis and a rope (thankfully one without an anchor in) whipped his back window and shattered it. Another managed to catch a rope and attached it to his tow, he had to abandon that pretty quick as it was physically pulling his vehicle \n\nNot only was that show obviously cancelled, but we lost in excess of about \u00a31000 in stock as it was our 2nd biggest show of the year. We're all sat there like thank fuck for the dual insurance. \n\nSpeed up a few days later to claim. Ours and multiple others point blank refused to pay anyone, citing a storm doesn't count for standard weather damage, it counts as, and get this right \"An act of God\" and legally they were entitled not to pay out because the storm severity was out of reasonable foreseeable conditions. As I said, they were specialists in just offering weather insurance. And we're talking Wales, UK here so nothing crazy in the grand scheme of things. \n\nMy folks were stressed out their mind for weeks. Not just the value of stock gone and lost earnings. But back in those days we had a small standard hob. A batch of cooking was 4 small pans that took hours to cook. Each pan having a value of about \u00a325 retail contents wise. So you can imagine how friken long it takes to build up a stock. \n\nThankfully, while we're a small business. The association at the time wasn't and the at the time current president was a retired lawyer and he was down for making it a long drawn out battle to cost them through the roof. A few months in and they agreed to pay out what their policy said we'd all get and we dropped the moment the cheques cleared.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Hmm. Again, I am not a professional by any means. \n\nSo in those stories I feel your deep pain friend, and I'm so sorry you are hurting so badly. I see you. But if I can presume, I also see a family friend who moved in to keep you alive. I see a wife and sister who made the painful choice to get you help when they couldn't keep you safe. I know it may have felt like a betrayal, but their love for you meant that the fear of you hurting yourself was stronger than their respect for your wishes of staying out of the hospital. With the limited information I have, I would have done the same thing. I see 7 people at the door trying to convince you not to hurt yourself. All of those people care about you profoundly. Your dogs certainly love you. And the strength left your arm for a reason. You aren't done here, and you know it. You are just tired of hurting. \n\nSo then the question is, why is the saboteur so convincing at telling you that you aren't loved, and blocking those feelings of love from reaching you? What those voices in your head tell you does not necessarily match reality. They are telling you what they are afraid of, not what is real. \n\nI also think, maybe consider what you are asking of others - what do you need from them? Is it possible for them to give it? If what you want from them is to make you feel better, that isn't something they can do until you are ready to receive it. And if you have loud, powerful saboteurs yelling in your ear that no one loves you and you aren't questioning them, you may not be ready to receive that yet. Emphasis on the YET. There is hope for you, and the tide can turn faster than you would believe. Do you have support? A therapist?", "label": 0}

However the third, even though it has a similar theme, is one of my favourite horrors because of its style and horrific story that is a study of a serial killer.\n\nGrotesque is a Japanese torture porn movie that took the idea of hostel and went all... well Japanese on it.\n\nThe second is August Underground.\n\nThat did the same thing but went American Teens.\n\nBoth movies are basically a movie about 1 or 2 guys torturing some poor souls.  They don't escape, there is no hope nor release (though if iirc August Underground has somewhat if a imagination ending, buy I honestly forget) the reason I forget about A.U. is because at least with Hostel one if the victims was going to get away, there would be the climactic triumph over adversity and the sole survivor walks away, changed forever.\n\nNope. Not with these two, it was just people being tortured to death.\n\n\nWhich takes me to one of my top 10 possibly top 3 horrors.\n\n\n(Forgive the spelling if autocorrect doesn't pick it up)\n\nThe Poughkipsie Tapes.\n\nThe tell the story in a documentary and found footage style of the victim of a serial killer who records all his kills, but keeps one captive.  I'm not going to spoil this because it has a very twisted ending and I found the cat and mouse games the killer played were something else.\n\nThough the themes are the see, Grotesque, and August Underground are for shock value only and have no story nor plot, and the movie itself stay with you for a while as a lot of what you see is just fucking barbaric.\n\nWhereas TPT is a study of murder, obsession, black humour, mystery all wrapped up in 1200 video tapes (the movie will give the reference)\n\nI would recommend The Poughkipsie Tapes to any horror fan.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The thing is, Paradis is a stand-in for post-war Japan. The whole \"then their memories got erased\" is basically the author's allegory for post-war Japan just wanting to \"get over it\" and put Japan's colonialism behind them.\n\nThe reason the story falls apart is because it's actually just a long, drawn out metaphor for the author's own victim complex over how the victims of Japanese colonialism refuse to just \"get over it\" like they did, which makes him the *real* victim of Japanese colonialism because sometimes he feels bad talking about it.\n\nSee, a lot of overseas fans don't know this, but the original comic came out at the height if the ultra right-wing \"masochistic education\" movement, which was basically a movement demanding that children in schools not be taught anything negative about Japanese history to avoid \"confusing\" them, and that they must never be made to feel bad about anything their country has ever done.\u00a0\n\nBut also that, if they *did*, it would be incredibly destructive to Japanese society - which, they also believed was the explicit goal of foreigners refusing to \"get over\" the past and keep talking about that history - things like memorials to Japan's victims were treated as *existential threats.* Feeling sad in history class was portrayed as literal reverse genocide.\n\nIt's not even subtle, either, the entire plot of the comic is literally just \"make up a fantasy world where ultra right wing beliefs about 'masochistic education' are a real thing.\" You get a world where the people who study their country's history turn into literal monsters who go and try to eat the other people who've magically forgotten all that and can't understand why they're being attacked.\n\nIt's obviously all just unhinged nonsense, but the clever thing the author did was set it in not-Germany, which made a lot of people see it as an anti-Nazi allegory, (which still falls apart when you get to the Eldians in ghettoes marked by yellow stars).\u00a0\n\nBut it all kinda falls into place when you realize Paradis isn't Nazi Germany, it's early 2000's Japan. It's cohesive, it's just that it's a cohesive presentation of an utterly insane worldview, which you, a sane person, instinctively rejected.\n\nThe author even hints at this early on when he portrays the only Japanese character, Mikasa, as the last surviving victim of a genocide - it's literally just a Japanese version of \"they're coming for our women,\" and it's just right there in the first few episodes.\u00a0", "label": 0}

{"text": "Noise reduction for subs hasn't advanced nearly as far as sub sensing technology. There's only so much you can do to not make noise, and almost everything you can do was already implemented during the cold war, rubber coating around the hull, special propeller designs, keeping your speed low, and just having everybody be quiet. There's only one other thing you can reasonably do to reduce noise, and that's to turn off the power plant at low speeds.\n\nMeanwhile, sub sensing capabilities have advanced dramatically with the use of computers. Passive sonar can already detect infrasound, now we can put sounds into a computer to determine what made it. \n\nYou pointed out that China has a greater shipbuilding capacity than us. This is true. But shipbuilding capacity \u2260 ships, and in this conversation, does not mean more subs. And unless they plan to massively expand their boomer fleet, to the point that our attack subs wouldn't be able to follow them all, it's not an issue. They're not planning to, but if they did, we can restore our shipbuilding capability, which is mostly mothballed since the end of the cold war. \n\nPart of breaking out of the cold war era mindset is to acknowledge the massive changes to nuclear strategy since the 90's. First thing, we don't have 50,000 nukes, we only have 2,000  in our active arsenal, and the yield has dropped significantly. While 100% counterforce effectiveness should never be assumed, the major change is that if only a handful of nukes get through, that might be considered acceptable for a nuclear war, especially considering what we were planning for in the cold war. This increases the possibility for nuclear war.\n\nThe rapid pace of technology, especially in reconnaissance and accuracy, means this trend will continue. This undermines strategic stability, and the only obvious solution is for more countries to build more nukes. But we don't want this either, more nukes is bad, but there isn't really any other solution other than to ignore it. And in my opinion, putting your head in the sand for nuclear strategy is really, really bad.\n\nOh, yeah, and the whole hurting for bodies thing, that's old news from a year ago.

Being exposed to stuff that challenged me emotionally and intellectually was worth the occasional freak-out after watching *Aliens* way too young. :)", "label": 0}
