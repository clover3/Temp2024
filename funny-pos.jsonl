{"text": "Hey bro, I disagree.\n\nFeminism didn't create narcissistic women, it enabled those women to be assholes in public. They were going to be that way regardless in private. \n\nNeo-feminism is the new wave. The rally flag of anti-humanists / anti-patriarchy that see men as inferior beings, or as deserving of hate for the sole quality of being male. There's plenty of reasons (though of course, none of them good or rational) to steer towards that general message without being a narcissist, though that's usually rooted in trauma or a learned hate during childhood.\n\nSo while I hear you, I disagree with the premise on which you introduced the topic.\n\nThat said... It came out of nowhere. I don't understand how you saw neo-feminism as relevant to the comment chain, and even after the fact I still don't think it is.\n\nBoomers got married because they felt like they had to. They stay married because they feel like they have to. In their day, you were a harlot if you ever dated more than one person in your lifetime... But also the Internet wasn't really around in their 20s so they didn't have much of a reach in terms of the people they could meet. The \"haha wife bad\" is beyond stereotypical of boomer humor, just look at the newspaper comics that have been around for ***decades*** at this point. They (mostly) all appeal to the older generation of folks that are disgruntled and frustrated with their spouses but lack the communication skills or capability to compromise to solve any of their problems, in part because they don't feel they should have to communicate or compromise.\n\nBut we as the newer generations have learned that those two things are what a healthy relationship revolves around, and that one is built upon trust and compassion... The other two things at least one of my parent's relationships have been marred by a distinct lack of. We've learned from their mistakes and find \"haha wife bad\" humor to be a pathetic grasping at straws to justify their being terrible at relationships, so we make fun of it.\n\nHas nothing to do with neo-feminists.", "label": 1}

'Fanks mate.\n\nIf you wanna scare a kid these days, you have to dress like global warming, or worse, P. Diddy. And dressing up as the Diddler poses its own set of dangers as painting one's face black is a huge no-no, unless you're the Prime Minister of Canada (zing!). So where does that leave you for scary costume ideas? Fear not, here is a list of costume ideas for you:\n\n\u2022 Buy a discounted roast beef, tape it to your chest, and pour White-Out all over yourself - presto! You're Elon Musk on a yacht!\n\n\u2022 Go to San Francisco, collect street poop, cover yourself in it, and you can dress up like Your Online Privacy Rights. Hold your applause, we know, we know, topical and witty. It's just what we do.\n\n\u2022 Join the Israeli Military cyber defense squad, then create ExpressVPN, and go partying dressed as\u00a0their secretive owner, Teddy Sagi!\n \u00a0The Three Horsemen of the Apoopcalypse\n\nIf you are like us and don't have time for Halloween shenanigans because you are busy building things, or are too socially awkward to dress up as a slutty astronaut/cat/presidential candidate and party, fear not! You can just dress up your IP address as another\u00a0sluttier\u00a0IP address instead! It's exactly like Halloween except without cavities! Get Windscribe Pro and take your IP address trick or treating online for only $49 a year!\n\nWindscribe's Scariest Sale\n\n\nWhether you go out or stay in, we hope you have a safe and fun Halloween. Be careful when partaking in orgiastic candy-eating sessions and remember not to eat too many pillowcases full of those infant-fist-sized chocolate confections - lest you're forced to release a torrential storm into your toilet.

And Miles spake unto the people, saying: Behold, ye sons and daughters of Nephi, how long shall ye fear the armies of the Lamanites? For the Lord hath looked upon thy suffering and hath heard thy cries.\n\n>3. Therefore, thus saith the Lord, thy God, unto thee: Mount ye upon the tapirs which the Lord hath prepared for thy deliverance, for in the strength of these beasts shall ye be mighty.\n\n>4. And ye shall ride forth in my name, and the Lamanites shall tremble, for never before have they beheld such a host.\n\n>5. And ye shall gird up your loins and go forth, riding upon the tapirs into the midst of battle; and I, the Lord, shall go before you and scatter your enemies.\n\n>6. And it came to pass that the Nephites did hearken unto the words of Miles, and they did gather up their strength, each man finding a tapir and mounting thereon.\n\n>7. And the women and children did look on with wonder, for it was a sight most curious to behold, even the mighty Nephites riding upon the backs of the tapirs.\n\n>8. And the Nephites did go forth, and the power of the Lord was upon them, and they did prevail against their enemies, for the Lamanites fled in fear and confusion.\n\n>9. Thus was the word of the Lord fulfilled, and Miles departed from among them, ascending once more into heaven. And the Nephites gave thanks unto the Lord for the victory, and they remembered the tapirs all the days of their lives.", "label": 1}

More recently, even today, artists argue that using a lot of the tools available digitally is \"cheating.\" \n\nLook further back, and you'll find the same arguments against photography.\n\nI'm pointing out the evolution of what is considered art, and who is considered an artist, is subjective to the time, and those decrying the current technology would be exactly who was subject to harsh criticism in the past.", "label": 1}
