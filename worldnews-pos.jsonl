So they will respond in such a way that israel can't strike back oil and nuke.

{"text": "> I just haven't really studied the major differences ( yet ).\n\nA lot of them, Sunnis and Shias really are quite divergent in beliefs, not as much as to the same extent that certain Protestants are from Catholics, but there really exist a ton of differences between Sunnis and Shias that would warrant a lot of enmity, not only simply theological or religious, but also political and social.\n\nIn a way that is stretching a lot and not being accurate, but trying to be the easiest as possible for non-Muslim Westerners to understand, is that Sunnis are Protestants, whereas Shias are the Catholics, but only so in belief, since unlike in Christianity where Catholics have historically held more power and are more numerous, with Islam, the Sunnis are the majority, and Shias are minority.\n\nBut the comparisons to Protestantism vs. Catholicism still exist, i.e. Shias venerate Ali a lot, have Twelve Imams, Saints, have clergy that they give a great deal of veneration towards, in ways that are comparable to the veneration of the Virgin Mary, the Saints, and clergy of Catholicism, and so the Sunnis commonly accuse Shias of being idolaters and heretics who worship Ali and the Imams instead of Allah, they have different Hadith that the Sunnis do not have, historically they have hated and sometimes even insulted revered figures in Sunni Islam (such as Abu Bakr, Umar, and Aisha, but this practice of insulting Sunni figures has died down in the modern times since Iran tries to court Sunni countries, Iran banned a holiday that literally celebrated the assassination of Umar and venerated his assassin as a hero).\n\nShias also are also quite more relaxed with artwork, statues, drawings, etc., whereas the Western world is now likely aware that drawing prophets of Islam is a no-no in Sunni Islam, meanwhile, the Shias are more tolerant of it, and there are a ton of beautiful Renaissance-styled Shia artwork depicting Islamic prophets, it is not uncommon for you to see paintings, posters, and artworks of Ali and Muhammad in Iran and Iraq (though in the majority of the time Muhammad has his face veiled), see where the \"these Shias worship idols!\" comparison is coming from?\n\nAn issue however, is that the majority of Shias in the world are Twelver Shias, Iran and Iraq included, so the vast majority of information about Shia Islam on the internet is specifically about the majority of them that are the Twelvers, and have their own unique history, leaders, and beliefs that are not universally shared with all Shias.\n\nFor example, the Zaidi Shias of Yemen are a different branch of Shiism, and they have more similarities to Sunnis than Twelvers do, the most important Zaidi Shia movement in the world right now are the Ansar Allah of Yemen, more commonly known as **the Houthis**.\n\nThere are also the Ismaili Shias, and the Ismailis themselves have many schisms and separate groups in their own right, for example, the largest (I think) Ismaili Shia group today have a living Imam, named [Aga Khan IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_IV), a billionaire socialite who lives in Portugal, and is more-or-less comparable to the Pope or Dalai Lama.\n\nAnd furthermore, other than Sunnis and Shias, in Islam there exists a third, yet obscure, quiet, and small denomination of it that is arguably the oldest branch of Islam and predates both Sunnism and Shiism, they are the [Ibadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi_Islam), which is today only mainly followed in Oman, with tiny Ibadi minorities in Zanzibar, Algeria, and Libya.\n\nGiven the relative geographic isolation of Oman, Ibadi Islam has managed to survive as an independent branch of Islam, that was largely unaffected in the many wars and theological controversies that the religion underwent in the past thousand years, today, Ibadis are known for being arguably the most pacific and moderate branch of Islam that is not full-blown Western-styled liberalism and progressivism, with Oman being the most peaceful country in the Middle East, and (by Middle Eastern standards) having *decent* degrees of religious freedom.\n\nIbadism being the most peaceful and moderate branch of Islam is however, very, **very**, ironic, since they originated from the Khawarij movement, which were ironically, the first ever instance of Islamic terrorism and extremism in Muslim history, basically, the Khawarij refused to recognize either Abu Bakr (like the Sunnis did) or Ali (like the Shias did) as their leaders, turning into a neutral third faction that did not supported either.\n\nThe Khawarij would later on degrade into paranoia and fanaticism to the extent that they started to accuse anyone who did not followed them of being an apostate, and thus worthy of death, which they would end up pulling a string of assassinations, Ali himself was assassinated by a Khawarij.\n\nHopefully for the Ibadis, although they originated in the Khawarij sect, they were a part of the more moderate and less fanatical faction of the ones who rejected either Caliph, and thus they managed to survive, while the violent Khawarij continued with assassinations and wars until they were all were exterminated.\n\nI did not expected that this comment would have gotten this big, I would recommend you to watch the videos by Lets Talk Religion on YouTube on these subjects!\n\nSunni and Shia differences: https://youtube.com/watch?v=AQARp3gyyG0\n\nIbadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJekZhpT-s", "label": 1}

{"text": "What you stated had no verifiable facts and arguably disregarded the reality of this war.\n\n\n1. Ukraine has been reporting 1000+ Russian casualties since this spring.\n\n\n2. During the beginning of Russian offensives in 2022 and 2023 Ukraine was primarily focused on shaping operations and defending major civilian centers as they lacked the appropriate equipment to both push back and protect their cities, hence why Russia was able to gain do much ground. Since then, they've significantly increased their drone manufacturing capabilities, sunk most of the Russian black sea naval fleet, and destroyed their most modern equipment.\n\n\nSince then Ukraine has:\u00a0\u00a0\n- Sunk or forced withdrawal of most of Russias black sea naval fleet\u00a0\u00a0\n- Destroyed a significant amount of Russias most modern equipment forcing them to fall back on antiquated equipment with questionable service history\u00a0\u00a0\n- Developed and massively ramped up production of their own drone manufacturing\u00a0\u00a0\n- Taken out a significant amount of Russias AA capabilities allowing for deeper and more destructive drone strikes\u00a0\u00a0\n- Ramped up their own AA capabilities, both limiting Russian strike operations and pushing back their air fleet\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nEach and every one of these factors contribute to the increase in Russian casualties. The drone manufacturing being the biggest one. Russia is forced to split into small groups that are harder to target, but easier to overcome.\n\n\nYour assumption that Russian casualties would simply remain at 500 throughout the war is both nonsense and completely ignorant.

It will make sense when i explain it.\n\nReported by Reuters, Forbers, etc... according to Ukraine 80% of casualties are due to artillery.

Safe to say Russia has an advantage with drones as well.\n\nAir Power - FAB glide bombs have been dominating the news cycle in the past months, meanwhile the only mention of airpower on the ukranian side was the downed F-16. So, russia has air domination. Once again an advantage for russia.\n\nArmor and equpment - Zelensky has been making the rounds saying they can't equip their new brigades. Russia meanwhile: \"Moscow has massively ramped up its industry, giving it advantages in Ukraine\" - The Guardian. So here too we can give an advantage to Russia.\n\nThe only thing that Ukraine has got going for them is that they are on the defensive, but even that has not always been the case (think the 2023 summer offensive, Kurst incursion)\n\nSo out of these 5 areas, Russia has the advantage in 4.

Assuming a growth rate of 2.5% annually, there would have been 65,000 Jews living there today. Almost an order of magnitude less than today's 450,000, but not exactly Jew-free either. So I would argue that the presence of these communities, while a driver of conflict, is not ***entirely*** illegitimate. \n\nIn addition, consider that area A is forbidden to Jews.

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: \u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0, b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Peng declared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square.

The protests happened before the Israeli military had a single boot inside Gaza in support of the Oct. 7th massacre, there were protests during the ceasefire in November 2023, and the main points of the protests are a call for a ceasefire/stopping the alleged genocide. Not until people criticized the protests for being futile that some of the protesters claimed that it\u2019s not actually about the alleged genocide per se, but rather the US supposedly funding it.\n\nMoreover, many of the protests claimed inspiration from the anti-South Africa apartheid protests in the 1980\u2019s. Back then, the US didn\u2019t fund the apartheid regime \u2014 in fact, it actively acted against it. \n\nWhat the commenter above said is pertinent because if the protests are against US funding of wars that cause massive civilian deaths, then why weren\u2019t the protests against the Saudi campaign in Yemen? If the protests are about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza, why weren\u2019t there protests about the Sudan? If the protests are about the alleged genocide, why weren\u2019t there protests against the actual Chinese genocide against Uyghurs and calls for boycotting Chinese goods and services? \n\nIsrael is being singled out \u2014 it\u2019s more than bias, it\u2019s an impossible double standard that is literally never asked of any other country in the world. And the only thing that is unique about Israel and this war is, obviously, it being Jewish. No one questions the legitimacy of Saudi Arabia, Sudan, or China because of the actions of its government, whether or not it\u2019s funded by the US. Hell, even the existence of South Africa wasn\u2019t called into question even back then, only its apartheid regime. But, for some inexplicable reason (/s), Israel is. \n\nAnd btw, the US isn\u2019t funding the war, it\u2019s funding its own military industrial complex. It does so by giving credit to Israel which it can use to purchase US made in return for Israel sharing its data and information with the US, as well as its R&D \u2014 which is, by itself, more valuable than all of the military aid the US gives to Israel. Also, the majority of Israel\u2019s military funds, including the US aid, is Israeli, so it\u2019s not like the war is entirely funded by the US, far from it.", "label": 1}

Back in the 1980s in India, girls were totally controlled by parents and \"what will other people say?!\" / \"people will talk dirty things!\" if they wore shirts, t-shirts, pants, skirts, and in general, clothes of a \"western\" kind.\n\nBut then we opened up our economy in the 1990s and suddenly everyone wanted to sell clothes to women because money is the greatest need, above traditional values. So a sufficiently large number of tight fitting jeans were bought and sold. Now nobody cares what girls wear, at least in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in India.\n\nOur movie industry, Bollywood, was constantly pushing for freedom for women for a long time, but what really pushed the rock over the edge was liberalisation of the economy. Now even the grumpy traditional men who wanted to control their women folk decided that should focus on making money rather than controlling women. They saw on American and British TV channels and shows that women don't immediately become sluts and whores if they start wearing jeans. The number of early adopters grew and reached a critical mass, to start a large profitable industry, and now western / modern wear is the norm across half the country (the other half is the really poor and/or traditional rural India).\n\nNobody had a mass movement, or strikes, for women's freedom to wear whatever they want. Rather, money did the trick. But that initial small population that always wore the latest western outfits, they were the ones to start and steer the direction of the change. But they also had to wait for about 3 decades - 60s, 70s, 80s.\n\nSo I guess, what you say is right :\n> We might not steer the whole ship, but we can still help set its direction.\n\nPersonally, I've fought long and hard and I'm exhausted and bitter. \n\nSorry for the lecture.", "label": 1}

If you have an idea about how to stop those war crimes, and put a less evil government in place in Gaza, with less war, I will be quite happy to discuss it. I would love to reduce the death toll here. All the plans I can come up with involvere placing the IDF on the ground with someone else, preferably someone good at COIN and with legitimacy in Gaza. The list of countries good at COIN, with 50k troops to spare, who wil lnot be treated as evil imperialists by Gaza's civilians, while being acceptable to Israel, who would actually searching for hostages, and would agree to do this shit? Basically nobody. 50k US Marines would do everying but have legitamcy in the eyes of the Gazan people. That's the closest I fucking get.\n\nAlso: your use of the term justify is problematic. It implies that morality is part of the equation. This is a war. Once you get to the point that the solution to the conflict is War you're not going to get any form of morality or justice until the war ends. Which is why litteraly everyone who know howmilitary power works advise thefolk holding hostages and/or their remains to just give them up already. Morality is not going to be a thing in Gaza until those 101 are back home, or the Israelis have bankrupted themselves searching the place with high explosives, and that is how reality is going to work. \n\nYou rmeember the start of COVID? When a bunch of people were gonna die, and you knew they were gonna die, and you could guess who was vulnerable, but you couldn't do anything about it? This is that.

There are a number of countries in the region who *need* Israel to exist specifically so that they can point their own people's frustration with their own oppression at The Jews\u2122 and give them something to hate.

Just to name a few independent organisations that have officially proclaimed Israel as an apartheid state: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Court of Justice\u2026oh and not to mention the Israeli organisation B\u2019Tselem. Also just for your general education, here are some laws and policies that Israeli implement that literally fit the definition of an apartheid state: \u2018forcible transfer of  Palestinians to make way for illegal Israeli settlements\u2019, preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes and lands (including millions of refugees living in exile)\u2019, denying Palestinians their right to freedom of movement and residence (especially, but not limited to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip)\u2019, \u2018the unlawful indefinite detention of Palestinian prisoners without charge\u2019. The most obvious is the Right of Return. The Right of Return allows all Jews and persons of some Jewish descent to immigrate to Israel and obtain citizenship whereas Palestinian refugees are not even allowed to return to their birthplace. Please enlighten me as to how this is not apartheid. Oh and also, very cute closing sentence, \u2018peace is not unilateral\u2019 that\u2019s very entitled of you.

{"text": "Absolutely. I have my own biases as everyone else does. I am however aware of this fact and try to maintain as objective a view as possible. I have yet to see anyone address any of my concerns regarding the IDF's conduct in Israel. I have watched evidence of war crimes documented by IDF soldiers who wilfully upload it to the internet as if something to gloat about.\n\nThere is a nuanced take here which I believe is that the actions of Hamas are egregious, and the response of the IDF is also abhorrent in its own right. I can't expect my word to influence a terrorist organisation. I can however hope that my word as a voting member of a democratic country with ties to Israel can influence their behaviour to prevent the unnecessary suffering of innocent civilian life.\n\nWhen the BBC is brought up, I have a little chuckle. I follow the events from both sides. I see both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian people claim the BBC is biased against either of them. From my own reading of their newspaper, it seems to lean either way depending on who writes the article. Sure it is biased, but I don't believe it to be as bad as it is made out to be. \n\nI also don't believe this to be a fair defence for the criticism of Israel. If Israel is behaving in a way that violates international law, it should be documented and they should be held accountable. If it aids and abets the aims of a terrorist organisation, that doesn't automatically de-legitimise any of it. As long as it is true of course.\n\nAgain, I ask you the question. You claim that I am reading into my own biases, which I absolutely am, however at least I am forming my opinion on the basis of the aggregate consensus of international aid agencies, governments, and journalists. Not to mention direct evidence from Israeli cabinet members, ex IDF soldiers, and current IDF soldiers.\n\nRegardless of our disagreement on the topic of Israel's actions in Gaza. I would have hoped that both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian supporters would agree that restricting the press by only allowing them to enter Gaza accompanied by IDF soldiers and forced to sign an agreement preventing them from reporting on victims, and giving the IDF the ability to prevent media from airing is a red flag and a sign of fascism.

I asked you how the drug trade brings money INTO the country and your reply is that the \u2018supply chain\u2019 makes money along the way. Yeah, no shit, smartie. That\u2019s not bringing money into the country, that\u2019s money being traded inside the country, and it ignores the money paid out to the cartels OUTSIDE of the country. How are the cartels in Mexico worth billions if the drug trade brings the money into America?? It doesn\u2019t, drugs go in, money comes out. It\u2019s an unbelievably easy concept to grasp. That\u2019s why my initial comment was short and to the point. I\u2019ll just point out, again, that drug dealers profiting in the country aren\u2019t bringing money *into* the country, they\u2019re just soaking up money that\u2019s already in the country. In the grand scheme of things, money is paid to the cartels in Mexico (the money goes OUT of the US) in exchange for drugs. Yes, I realize dealers make money along the way. But that does nothing to change the fact that the drug trade is a net negative on cash inside the US. Like I said previously, drugs come IN, money is paid OUT initially, and then more money is laundered OUT later. It\u2019s a net negative of cash flow. Drugs are consumed, money is paid out. It goes *out* to the cartels.

Despite this, nearly every settlement near the front line has parents who refuse to evacuate, putting both themselves and their children at grave risk. A troubling pattern has emerged where some parents lie to and mislead police and other government services. NV journalist Serhiy Okunev visited Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, dodging attacks by FPV drones and witnessing the heroic work of local police as they struggle to save children under dire conditions.*\n\n Mandatory child evacuations don\u2019t happen everywhere along the front line. Local authorities only announce such measures in specific areas when the threat becomes imminent and the conditions for a decent life are completely absent. First, they declare the need for voluntary evacuation, then mandatory. Only in extreme cases do they proceed with forced evacuations of children.*\n\nIn the summer of 2024, such measures became necessary in the city of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast. By October, the situation there had become critical. The city had no electricity, gas, heating, or communications. Each day, occupiers drop three to ten high-powered guided bombs on the city and its surroundings. Artillery shelling also occurs daily, and in recent weeks, enemy FPV drones have \u201cpatrolled\u201d central streets and residential areas, attacking any car or person outside. Yet, despite these conditions, around a thousand civilians, including children, remain in the city.*\n\n*Old announcements remain at the Kurakhove city bus station\u2014buses to Kyiv, Lviv, and even Warsaw and Prague. Now, it\u2019s a surreal sight since entering or leaving the city is extremely dangerous. \u201cThere\u2019s no information on FPVs right now. Give it a try, but keep your speed up,\u201d police instruct at the last checkpoint before the city.*\n\n*Beyond this point lies a hazardous stretch. A civilian car, burned out, sits along the roadside, destroyed by Russian forces the previous day as people tried to leave the city. The journalist\u2019s car races over this section at over 100 km/h, eventually reaching residential areas. Here, drone attacks and shelling are also a risk, though there are opportunities to hide in damaged buildings and remaining shelters.*\n\n*Finally, they reach a Kurakhove police outpost, where the journalist meets police chief Artem Shchus. He\u2019s been working on evacuating people for several months, conducting high-risk missions in areas like Maryinka, Krasnohorivka, and Vuhledar. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Shchus helped evacuate over 1,600 civilians from active combat zones, including 222 children and 1,300 elderly individuals. He also provided first aid to 650 injured civilians. In early Oct. 2024, Shchus received the Order of Courage, Third Class.*\n\n*A few days ago, Russian propaganda started spreading rumors that the entire Kurakhove police force had abandoned the city, supposedly signaling its handover to the occupiers. This is a fake, similar to rumors in Aug. 2024 about Pokrovsk.*\n\n*\u201cWell, you can see for yourself where we are. That story about us fleeing must come from people who don\u2019t know me. Because I got to know the enemy back in Maryinka and Krasnohorivka. They probably remember what we did there. So here, we\u2019re still working, and no one\u2019s running away,\u201d Shchus responds to the Russian misinformation.*\n\n*Currently, evacuating civilians is one of the Kurakhove police\u2019s top priorities. Shchus estimates about a thousand civilians remain, including children. When asked if children are still present, he sighs deeply. \u201cYesterday, 16 people were evacuated from the Kurakhove community, including children. We didn\u2019t know about these particular kids beforehand; we found out during the evacuation process. So it\u2019s hard to give an exact number. Every time we manage to evacuate a family with kids, we hope\u2014maybe that\u2019s the last of them. But then, the next day or a few days later, we hear about more kids spotted somewhere,\u201d he says.*\n\n*\u201cPeople try all sorts of things. Sometimes they just hide the children in basements or cellars. Sometimes they get neighbors to vouch that, yes, the child has left; they saw it themselves. There\u2019s essentially no punishment for lying. Once, we found out a child was still at home, even though the mother claimed she\u2019d evacuated the child. When we eventually saw the child, she admitted, \u2018Alright, I was wrong, I get it, we\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u2019 The next day, we came back, and she\u2019d taken the child and fled to a nearby village. We had to search for her there. When we found her, she said, \u2018Yes, yes, tomorrow.\u2019 Of course, we didn\u2019t believe her this time,\u201d recalls volunteer Yaroslav, whose organization, People More Precious Than Gold, assists the police with evacuations.*\n\n*Officer Kostiantyn explains that while they call it a \u201cforced evacuation,\u201d police have limited means to convince someone to leave. \u201cRussian propaganda lies that we storm houses with rifles, handcuff children, kidnap them, and separate them from their parents. It\u2019s all false. First, we always evacuate whole families, as required by law. Both parents, or one parent, or a legal guardian leaves with the child; we can\u2019t forcefully split up families. No one\u2019s waving rifles around\u2014we talk, explain the consequences. No threats and certainly no physical force,\u201d he clarifies.*\n\n*His colleague, Yevhen, notes that those who absolutely refuse to evacuate are often of lower social status, struggle with alcoholism or domestic violence, and are heavily influenced by Russian propaganda. He recalls being accused by one mother: \u201cI know you want to sell my child\u2019s organs to foreign buyers.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s really tough work, honestly. We have to deal even with people like this. I feel deeply sorry for the children. Adults can choose to endanger themselves, but to effectively hold a child hostage because you read something in a Russian Telegram channel\u2014that\u2019s horrifying. It\u2019s tough to keep calm in those moments, but we have to keep explaining, even if what we hear is utter nonsense,\u201d Yevhen says.*\n\n(Edited, the whole article is well worth the read.

This is difficult to do with a lot of your brigades are not at full strength and I need to be regenerated with fresh troops that don\u2019t have anywhere close to the amount of experience that they would like. On top of that they don\u2019t necessarily have this sort of training pipeline in order to equip and train, even if they did manage to mobilize such a large number of people.

{"text": "NATO has indeed expanded eastward over the years, moving closer to Russia\u2019s borders and taking in several former Soviet states, including the Baltic countries in 2004. This expansion is strategic, gradually surrounding Russia with NATO-aligned states and increasing the alliance\u2019s presence in Eastern Europe. Though framed as a defensive alliance, NATO\u2019s actions signal to Russia that it\u2019s being increasingly encircled by a historically rival military force.\n\nFor Russia, NATO\u2019s buildup near its borders\u2014however gradual or measured\u2014represents a serious security threat. Even before the 2022 conflict, NATO had increased its military exercises and presence in Eastern Europe, particularly after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. While NATO claims these moves are defensive, Russia perceives them as provocative, undermining its security and sovereignty in the region.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that Russia views NATO as an aggressor. Russia has repeatedly voiced its concerns over NATO\u2019s expansion, and each step eastward heightens these anxieties. NATO\u2019s continued push to involve Ukraine, even indirectly, intensifies the situation, signaling that NATO\u2019s strategy may, in fact, be aimed at encircling and containing Russia. If NATO\u2019s intention were purely peace, it might have heeded Russia\u2019s longstanding concerns rather than escalating its presence in the region.", "label": 1}

After the fall of the Soviet Union and the taste of what it's like to be under Russian authority, these Eastern European countries understandably want nothing to do with them, and they know they have no chance against Russia in an event of a military confrontation, hence their desire to join NATO.\n\nYou speak of encirclement of Russia by NATO, and how NATO has increased its presence in Eastern Europe, but this happened precisely as a response to Russia's actions in Ukraine in 2014, as you said it yourself:\n\n> Even before the 2022 conflict, NATO had increased its military exercises and presence in Eastern Europe, particularly after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014\n\nAlso, Crimea was not the start of all this. Russia has a history of invading and destabilizing neighbouring countries before Ukraine: they did this with Georgia in 2008, where they invaded Georgia and stationed troops in Ossetia.\n\nYou can't blame Eastern European countries for seeking protection from NATO after seeing what happens when Russia doesn't get what they want. They know they have no chance alone, so they need to seek alliances. If the Russian administration is so tone-deaf that they cannot understand why their neighbouring countries would be apprehensive when they start invading other countries, then that's a failure of Russia's administration, not NATO's.\n\nAnd finally, NATO is transparent about what they do, their exercises, and deployments.

Putin is probably *shitting himself* now because this completely fucks up any gameplan (if he even had a viable gameplan) because he cannot second guess Trump.\n\nYes, it's possible, likely even, that Trump's \"negotiation\" will cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, and yes, that's not good. But if there's one thing Trump cannot do, it is looking weak. He'll have a long long list of \"oh and by the way...\" for Putin, none of which Putin is going to like. \n\nTrump is selfish, moronic, aggrandising, and arrogant - he'll bleed Russia dry just to prove a point, and Putin will get what in return? Some land that Ukraine will get back anyway when Putin finally kicks the bucket, not long from now hopefully, and Trump is an ex-president who will never hold power ever again.\n\nSort it out guys, shit like this \"Trump is a Russian asset, hurrrr\" is exactly how idiots like him win elections.", "label": 1}
