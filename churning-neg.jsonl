{"text": "I'm a military guy and AMEX fanboy looking to get into the Chase scene, but not sure on Perferred vs. Reserve. Also considering a United card due to upcoming travel, plus maybe a Marriot card down the road.\n\n2) 788\n\n3) USAA Visa (2015), AMEX Platinum (2018), AMEX Delta Plat (Dec 21), Bilt (Jan 23), AMEX Delta Reserve (Feb 23), Hawaiian Airlines (Oct 24). I'm at 4/24 until December, if I'm doing the math right. \n\n4) No concerns hitting $4-5K in 3 months for a SUB\n\n5) Not really, unless I'm off-pace for earning my SUB\n\n6) Not intrested in business cards\n\n7) I wouldn't consider myself a \"churner\" just yet, but I've been getting more serious about the points game in the last few years. \n\n\\- I think it's about time I get a Chase Sapphire card, but I'm not sure which Being military, I'm agnostic to the AF. I was going to go for the CSP because of the $300 travel credit offer, but then I realized that CSR has it too, and annually (but I don't have to use it in the Case travel portal?). SUB is 60k points for both. I'm noticing that the general travel multiplier is 3x for CSR vice 2x for CSP. I could use a better card for hotels; currently my best option is 3x miles on my Delta Plat, and I'd rather get points. I don't live/travel through an airport with a Sapphire lounge, so I don't care too much about that (although the Boston one was nice), and I have Priority Pass etc. via AMEX Plat. CSP does have the streaming multiplier, but I don't think that will account for nearly as much as extra travel points. My understanding is that you can't have both cards, unlike AMEX products. While I was attracted to the $300 CSP offer, it looks like the CSR is a better deal for me, no?\n\n\\- In addition, I'm strongly considering adding a United card. I'll be taking a work trip at some point in the few months that costs about $2k on United, plus we fly United to several places. I have Delta Gold and want to try to status-match with United too. I'm considering the United Club Infinite card so that I can get into their lounge, and it seems like I'm not missing out on much else WRT the other United cards. However, I can't go for both the CSR/CSP and Chase United card until at least December when I'll drop to 3/24, so I need to prioritize. \n\n\\- I'm not big on burning points for hotels, but I'm considering adding a Marriott card down the road, as I typically pick them for domestic travel (plus Gold statusholder via AMEX).  Might as well go for the SUBs while I'm immune to AFs, plus other perks. Free nights would be nice, especially if I want to treat myself every now and then. Not my priority because I like average hotels when traveling, and Mariott properties are usualy more expensive overseas (albiet higher quality). Seems like the best choices are Chase's MB Boundless or AMEX's MB Brilliant. Boundless is 125k for $5k in 3 months; Brilliant is 95k for $6k in 6 months. Both come with a free night, but Briliant's goes to a higher point value plus Platinum status. Seems like Briliant is a no-brainer, especially if I hit 5/25, right? \n\n8) I'm primarilly targeting business class airfare for long-haul flights. I love to travel to faraway places, and upgrading the in-flight experience would be nice. I typically pick average hotels instead of high-end ones because I want to sightsee, not spend all of my trip in the expensive hotel. But I wouldn't mind doing a treat-yourself stay at a 5-star hotel for a special occasion, just not every trip. I also plan on doing occasional weekend trips to other Hawaiian islands; I don't intend to burn points for those, but they're an opportunity to rake up more points. \n\n9) AMEX 234k points, Delta 194k miles, Marriot 115k points, AA 82k miles, Hawaiian 70k miles (as soon as I complete the SUB), USAA 66k points (they're kinda worthless; at best I can spend them in their travel portal at 1 cent/point), Bilt 40k points, Etihad 14.5k miles (they expire in January; I need to spend them soon), United 13.5k miles\n\n10) HNL \ud83e\udd19\n\n11) I'll definitely be traveling to Japan a few times in the next few years; I already got a \"deal\" with my SkyPesos for Sakura season, and I may try to go in the winter for snowboarding season. For more aspirational trips, I want to visit New Zealand and/or Australia while I'm stuck in the middle of the Pacific. I'd also love a trip to Europe in a lie-flat seat, but I'm currently on the wrong end of the world for that (although I could fly to Tokyo/ICN and try to burn my SkyPesos to get to Europe in J from there...).\n\nTLDR:\n\na) If I'm not paying an AF, does CSR over CSP make more sense?\n\nb) Shoudl I go for CSR/CSP or United Club Infinite first? \n\nc) After getting those, anything wrong with the AMEX MB Brilliant?", "label": 0}

Told me what she saw was I have $22k in CL and a $25k revenue which she assumed, on top of the recent card, for instant denial.\n\nTold me if I was interested in the product to reapply, but obviously no guarantee as \"that's a short window between your last card because in the past couple of months our underwriting department has made some changes about the timing...\" (So, add to your DPs if the agent can be trusted, which seems to affirm thoughts around here).\n\nSo, with that info, I have $4k in spending at an IHG next weekend for an event (plus another $3k in other expenses). Would love the 200k offer, but just looking for opinions (without being the DP I want to see) on if given the current state of Chase Biz approvals and denials, now that I'm beyond 90 days, if you think it's worth it.\n\nDon't care about HPs. I care about getting 300k IHG points, but would rather just get another Biz Gold if there's no point.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Just got back from a great weeklong trip to the Netherlands/Belgium with the fiancee. It was originally a Southern France trip, but the weather forecast was awful so we pivoted. Love how flexible a lot of points travel (or at least hotels) can be for changes like this.\n\n**Flights**\n\n2x Business LAX -> CDG -> AMS via Air France on the 777-300ER for 100k total. 1 hr layover in CDG, actually had plenty of time to get from 2E to 2F, which I was really worried about.\n\n2x Business FRA -> LAS via Condor on A330-neo, booked with Alaska for 140k total.\n\n**Hotels**\n\n3x Nights at Hyatt Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht, 75k pts total.\n\n2x Nights at Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Reylof Ghent (Belgium), 48,250 (Hyatt) pts total. MMS property, booked their Junior suite through Hyatt.\n\n1x Night at Hyatt Place Frankfurt Airport. Used a Cat 1-4 Hyatt Cert. \n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nAlways love being in Amsterdam, but fiancee and I had the most fun with daytrips to Haarlem, Leiden, and museums in The Hague (the MC Escher museum was our favorite). Got upgraded to a canal view room at the Andaz in Amsterdam, we loved the free minibar, and the Globalist breakfast was excellent (1 menu item + buffet). Would love to stay there again, great value as Globalist, and the hotel itself is super funky and weird.\n\nBoutique hotel in Ghent was a pleasant surprise. No free breakfast or anything, but ~24k pts/night seemed a decent value for a really nice hotel in such a central location in Ghent. Ghent and Bruges nearby were both super cute towns to explore, we really liked both. We wandered Brussels for a day on our way to Frankfurt, and were pretty unimpressed compared to the cuteness of the towns we visited prior.\n\nFrankfurt airport continues to be the bane of our travel existence. The main terminal concourse, classic German bureaucracy on display with checkin/security process, and just overall layout drives me nuts. We chose FRA->LAS to see what Condor business on this route was like, and to stay relatively centralized for wherever we ended up traveling, but I think I'd prefer to fly out of most other large airports (minus CDG) in W Europe in the future.", "label": 0}

I tried to recon the business card decline and it didn't go through - they said ultimately too many accounts and too much credit. I have 3 variant Chase freedom personal cards and an amazon card in addition to the inks.\n\nMe and P2 are trying to go for the dual SW CPs, so since business declined me I also applied for the personal Chase SW 85k offer and got an instant decline - 1) Too many recent requests for credit and opened accounts with us -- in retrospect this was definitely because it was two applications within 30 days with the recent business card application.

That card becomes a lot harder to get as you churn through more cards because Capital One is sensitive to both inquiries and number of accounts. \n\nIt's also useful card to keep because the AF can be easily offset by the travel credit and it's the only one of two cards that offers free authorized users with full lounge access.\n\nJust double check the Venture X pre-approval tool before applying.

Chase has bene recently tightening Ink approvals over the last year or so. There's a limit to the number of open Inks you can have, which depends on your business type and revenue, but seems to average around 3 for most churners.\n\nIf you want to churn more Inks, you'll need to close any Inks and maybe other Chase business cards that are over a year old. For Inks under a year old, reduce the credit limit before applying.\n\n> Should re-apply for a CIU, and if so, when?

The Amex Biz Gold and Amex Biz Plat have high SUBs of up to 200k MR after spending $10-$15k in three months for the Biz Gold or 250k MR after spending $15-$20k in three months for the Biz Plat, depending on which offers you get targeted for. \n\nIf you plan on getting the USB biz cards, I recommend doing the app-o-rama by applying to all the USB biz cards simultaneously on the same day (the Triple Cash, Leverage, Altitude Connect, and maybe even the Altitude Power biz).

{"text": "Looking for some good hotel cards to open/general advice:\n\n\nI have the following cards:\n\n\nSapphire Reserve (Approved June 2024)\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash (Approved October 2023)\n\nCiti CustomCash (Approved April 2023)\n\nChase Freedom Flex (Approved December 2020)\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited (Approved February 2019)\n\nMy credit score on the Chase App is 763 (experian).\n\n\nI travel almost exclusively domestic US (PNW/CA/etc) on 1-3 day weekend type road trips and like to stay at Courtyard, Hyatt House, Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn, etc type places (2-3 star in more rural areas, but occasionally cities like PDX, SEA, SF, etc). I\u2019d say around 20-30 nights/year. I currently have the most hotel status with Marriott Gold (Until feb 2026 from CSR), and get the MMF rate there. I don\u2019t travel for work at all. I usually book very last minute (night of stay) too if that\u2019s relevant. I also really value any hotel status that gets me late checkout perks.\n\n\nI am almost done burning thru my sign on bonus from CSR. \n\n\nI fly very little and mostly drive. My work schedule doesn\u2019t really work with taking week long vacations abroad either.\n\n\nA few questions:\n\n1) I am not sure if CSR is best for me. I prefer to book directly with hotels rather than the portal. I mostly just transfer points to Hyatt tbh. What\u2019s the best way to downgrade to the CSP? Is it worth the downgrade?\n\n\n2) What\u2019s a good strategy on what cards to open? I think I am 3/24 for Chase? I didn\u2019t think about churning at all previously so didn\u2019t pay attention. I am seeing the Chase Hyatt card, would that be a decent deal? I could see myself staying 5 nights a year in Seattle and Vancouver where they have some Cat 4 options. Or what about the Marriott one for 125k point intro? Any other ones I\u2019m missing?\n\n\n3) I spend an above average amount on gas driving 25k miles/year doing all those weekend trips. I currently use the custom cash for groceries. Best card for gas here that can translate to hotel nights?\n\nNon housing spend is around 2-3k/mo, bump it up by 1500 if including housing/utilities/etc", "label": 0}
{"text": "I'm a military guy and AMEX fanboy looking to get into the Chase scene, but not sure on Perferred vs. Reserve. Also considering a United card due to upcoming travel, plus maybe a Marriot card down the road.\n\n2) 788\n\n3) USAA Visa (2015), AMEX Platinum (2018), AMEX Delta Plat (Dec 21), Bilt (Jan 23), AMEX Delta Reserve (Feb 23), Hawaiian Airlines (Oct 24). I'm at 4/24 until December, if I'm doing the math right. I also had 2 older cards that I closed before I knew what I was doing.\n\n4) No concerns hitting $4-5K in 3 months for a SUB\n\n5) Not really, unless I'm off-pace for earning my SUB\n\n6) Not intrested in business cards\n\n7) I wouldn't consider myself a \"churner\" just yet, but I've been getting serious about the points game in the last few years.\n\n\\- I think it's about time I get a Chase Sapphire card, but I'm not sure which Being military, I'm agnostic to the AF. I was going to go for the CSP because of the $300 travel credit offer, but then I realized that CSR has it too, and annually (but I don't have to use it in the Case travel portal?). SUB is 60k points for both. I'm noticing that the general travel multiplier is 3x for CSR vice 2x for CSP. I could use a better card for hotels; currently my best option is 3x miles on my Delta Plat, and I'd rather get points. I don't live/travel through an airport with a Sapphire lounge, so I don't care too much about that (although the Boston one was nice), and I have Priority Pass etc. via AMEX Plat. CSP does have the streaming multiplier, but I don't think that will account for nearly as much as extra travel points. My understanding is that you can't have both cards, unlike AMEX products. While I was attracted to the $300 CSP offer, it looks like the CSR is a better deal for me, no?\n\n\\- In addition, I'm strongly considering adding a United card. I'll be taking a work trip at some point in the few months that costs about $2k on United, plus we fly United to several places. I have Delta Gold and want to try to status-match with United too. I'm considering the United Club Infinite card so that I can get into their lounges, and it seems like I'm not missing out on much else WRT the other United cards. However, I can't go for both the CSR/CSP and Chase United card until at least December when I'll drop to 3/24, so I need to prioritize.\n\n\\- I'm not big on burning points for hotels, but I'm considering adding a Marriott card down the road, as I typically pick them for domestic travel (plus Gold statusholder via AMEX).  Might as well go for the SUBs while I'm immune to AFs, plus other perks. Free nights would be nice, especially if I want to treat myself every now and then. Not my priority because I like average hotels when traveling, and Mariott properties are usualy more expensive overseas (albiet higher quality). Seems like the best choices are Chase's MB Boundless or AMEX's MB Brilliant. Boundless is 125k for $5k in 3 months; Brilliant is 95k for $6k in 6 months. Both come with a free night, but Briliant's goes to a higher point value plus Platinum status. Seems like Briliant is a no-brainer, especially if I hit 5/25, right?\n\n8) I'm primarilly targeting business class airfare for long-haul flights. I love to travel to faraway places, and upgrading the in-flight experience would be nice. I typically pick average hotels instead of high-end ones because I want to sightsee, not spend all of my trip in the expensive hotel. But I wouldn't mind doing a treat-yourself stay at a 5-star hotel for a special occasion, just not every trip. I also plan on doing occasional weekend trips to other Hawaiian islands; I don't intend to burn points for those, but they're an opportunity to rake up more points.\n\n9) AMEX 234k points, Delta 194k miles, Marriot 115k points, AA 82k miles, Hawaiian 70k miles (as soon as I complete the SUB), USAA 66k points (they're kinda worthless; at best I can spend them in their travel portal at 1 cent/point), Bilt 40k points, Etihad 14.5k miles (they expire in January; I need to spend them soon), United 13.5k miles\n\n10) HNL \ud83e\udd19\n\n11) I'll definitely be traveling to Japan a few times in the next few years; I already got a \"deal\" with my SkyPesos for Sakura season, and I may try to go in the winter for snowboarding season. For more aspirational trips, I want to visit New Zealand and/or Australia while I'm stuck in the middle of the Pacific. I'd also love a trip to Europe in a lie-flat seat, but I'm currently on the wrong end of the world for that (although I could fly to Tokyo/ICN and try to burn my SkyPesos to get to Europe in J from there...).\n\nTLDR:\n\na) If I'm not paying an AF, does CSR over CSP make more sense? I'm leaning towards the Reserve.\n\nb) Shoudl I go for CSR/CSP or United Club Infinite first?\n\nc) After getting those, anything wrong with the AMEX MB Brilliant?", "label": 0}

I also have a short trip planned in Taiwan/Korea in January.\nMy plan was to get some QNs from staying at Hyatt properties in Taiwan(2-3 nights) and get the rest of QNs from business card spending.\nI would be using Delta miles to book return ticket from PDX-TPE and probably get revenue tickets TPE-ICN. \n\nBasically I want to have a Delta card and Hyatt card before I go to Taiwan in less than 3 months. \nIn what order should I get Delta and Hyatt card?\nAll my spending next year will be focused on Hyatt business card until I can get globalist and since I want head start on getting 5QN from spending 10K(I want to spend $9999 until 12/31/2024), I would want business card before end of the year.\nBut hitting SUB on Hyatt personal card for FNC to use in Taiwan sounds good too. I would only spend 5k on personal Hyatt for 2QN bonus and SUB.\nAlso for Delta Gold, either personal or business but personal offer(I've seen 85k offer dummy booking on Delta website) sounds better at the moment.\nHitting SUB before my trip to Taiwan would be great which shouldn't take more than few weeks but I could transfer UR(probably bad idea). I would want that 15% discount for having gold card regardless.\n\n\nTLDR: 3/24, slightly worried about Chase velocity 07/17/2024 and 09/24/2024, wanting to open Chase Hyatt personal and Business ASAP.\nAlso need Delta card for 15% discount on redemption, PDX-TPE only costing 44k miles return trip before discount on Delta RN.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Want to get your thoughts on something I am a little baffled by. I recently applied for a chase southwest business card on 10/25, as I am going for the companion pass in early 2025. I am currently 4/24 with excellent credit (700+). I do have 3 chase business cards open, which include the ink series of cash, preferred and unlimited. My business is a sole proprietorship with 1k in revenue per year. It was started in January 2024. I also recently applied for a chase southwest personal card and was approved on 10/8. That card is accounted for in my 4/24 status. \n\nI did not receive instant approval after my application and got a message saying my application was under review. I received a denial letter 2 days later stating that my application was denied because of too many requests for credit or opened accounts with chase and insufficient business revenue. When I called the reconsideration line a few days after receiving the denial letter, the rep I spoke with said it was a hard denial that was unable to go through reconsideration. I am struggling to understand the reason for the hard denial, but I am assuming it has to do with the requests for credit or opened accounts reason. As I said, I am 4/24, but I did just open another chase personal account 17 days prior to this application. I was under the impression that you could apply for 2 chase cards within 30 days, but is there a rule against this with business cards? I saw reference to this being a possibility in the wiki, but the way it was written, it didn't seem like this was a definitive rule. Any insight into this is appreciated.", "label": 0}

Next year we're going to spend a week in Kauai and a week in Maui. P2s vacation is sadly dictated by the local school calendar so we are pretty limited with the dates we can do. \n\n**Flights:** \n\n**SEA-LIH: 34,000 Delta miles** x 2 for comfort plus\n\n**LIH-OGG:** **7,500 AA miles** x 2 for HA economy\n\n**OGG-SEA:** **30,000 Alaska Miles** \\+\\~$150 x 2 for Alaska economy with exit row seats.\n\n**Hotels:**\n\n**LIH:** Sheraton Kauai Resort Deluxe Room, Oceanfront, 1 King bed for 7 nights \\~**330,000 UR** booked via the portal. \n\nI can feel the collective rage of the community for not booking the Grand Hyatt. Trust me P2 and I talked about and debated this a lot. It would have been less points but for us we valued the Sheraton's proximity to a swimmable beach. Also the view from the oceanfront rooms at the Sheraton look a lot better than the Hyatt's. So in the end did we pick the best \"deal\"? No, but I didn't want our trip to be dictated by it. Life is short burn your points in a way that works for you.\n\n**OGG**:  Wailea Ekahi - CoralTree Residence Collection, Studio Condo 1 King bed for 7 nights \\~**232,000 UR** booked via the portal. \n\nThis used to be a Destination by Hyatt Residence and this is where we've stayed the past two years. The condo is awesome and you can walk right down to the beach. The location is great and not far from shopping, restaurants etc. \n\nThoughts:\n\nI can't wait to go back to Hawaii. it's such a magical place. Swimming with turtles is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had and I love the laid back feel of our Hawaiian vacations vs the hustle and bustle of say a European trip.", "label": 0}

Ideally a card that I could accumulate Chase/Amex points with or transfer just as easily (e.g. I'm not interested in a card that only counts for United miles or Marriott points as I want more flexibility. I mostly use points now to transfer to airline or hotel partners for booking travel, I sometimes purchase flights through Chase rewards portal itself if I can't find a good code share. I don't have any specific airline or hotel chain loyalty, but do tend to book Delta when possible. I have Bonvoy gold through my Amex. I'm a casual churner, so would probably not do (much) manufactured spend to hit a minimum but I could probably hit a $10k min in 3 months if needed.\n\n1. What is your credit score? **754**\n2.

See\u00a0[this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/manufactured_spending)\u00a0for a primer on MS. Plastiq (for rent/mortgage/loan payments) and bank account funding are often good options for beginners. **Only if my actual spend isn't as high as anticipated. Would prefer not to.**\n5.

How many new cards are you interested in getting? Are you interested in getting into churning regularly (if you aren't already)? Or are you just looking to get a new card(s) for now but not get into churning long-term? **1. Willing to put in effort to hit sign up bonuses, but then don't really want to be actively working at it beyond that.**\n7. Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back? **Open to recommendations... I don't really travel enough for airline loyalty but anything that helps with better seating on flights (travel internationally 2-3x year, usually with points on economy) would be great.**\n8. What point/miles do you currently have? **100k Amex, 100k BILT, 100k Chase, and probably 100k miles spread throughout United/Delta/American.**\n9. What is the airport you're flying out of? **NYC airports**\n10. Where would you like to go? (The more specific you are, the better someone can recommend the right card. Tokyo is great, \"International travel\" is way too vague). **European flights, would go further with better seats.

In addition, these cards come with anniversary bonuses -- you may as well collect them before you close.\n\n> Open new cards in Q4 2026\n\nThe 24-month restriction is since you last received the bonus.

Was gifted a GOH award by a friend of a friend and got an upgrade to a junior suite on the 10th floor. Gotta love having the extra room to spread around and two bathrooms was really handy as well. Breakfast was pretty standard but got a little boring after the second morning. Visited the Giraffe Center which was fun and something I'd recommend especially for kids. Otherwise the rest of the trip was spent with family and shopping.

A few days before the flight we got the dreaded equipment change email, but it was for the NBO-DOH leg so wasn't too disappointed and figured it'd be cool to compare. At the airport we got access to the Turkish lounge but we didn't eat anything, just had showers since this was a 1am flight and we'd been out all day. Upon boarding, we were absolutely beaming to find that we did have QSuites after all! I was pretty exhausted though and after the novelty of the first 20 mins of flight time, I completely knocked out. Had probably the best sleep I had on a plane though. Woke up about an hour before landing and had a pretty good breakfast. Our layover was about 1hr so no time for a lounge stop. The short flight was on a B772 and the long flight was on the A35K, and we had the same seats on both (1E/1F) and they were identical. With my energy levels restored, I finally got to really geek out and fully appreciate the Qsuite and it was really amazing. Service was outstanding and the food was top notch, although I still think I would rank it second to SQ J. They recently added caviar to their menu so had to get that, but we weren't  \nparticularly impressed. The mezze starter was really good though, and we also enjoyed both the beef fillet and chicken cordon bleu. The Nutella croissant breakfast was probably the highlight, highly recommend it. Despite being a 15hr flight, and overall almost 22hrs of travel, we landed pretty refreshed and were sad to be leaving.", "label": 0}

Cashback is also acceptable if the RoS is good.\n9. UR, TYP, Venture miles, AA, Hyatt, IHG, WF Autograph points.\n10. SFO (majority of our flights are on *A)\n11. A big Europe trip is coming next year, but we have enough UR and hotel points to cover everything. I could see an Asia trip (Tokyo / Hokkaido?) in 2026. \n\nI'm pre-approved for the Triple Cash, so $750 is the baseline (13.5% RoS). Normally, the CIU with elevated SUB would be the play but I've opened a lot of Chase biz cards and would prefer to diversify. If there's no better option, we could take a shot and see what happens. Another potential option is the Signify Business Cash since we have the Autograph, but 50k WF points feels a bit low.\n\nOn the personal side, the BoA Preferred Rewards could be an option since we are platinum honors, so 17.625% RoS is decent. But I do care about 5/24 so I'm very cautious when applying for personal cards.\n\nWe are interested in Alaska miles, but we've already been denied for the BoA business card earlier this year. The Hawaiian card SUB is effectively 70k Alaska miles, but the card is fairly mediocre. The business card is better for churning but that SUB is only 50k.\n\nRegarding MR: we'll probably get the Amex charge cards at some point in the future, but we don't want to get into the Gold coupon book at the moment.", "label": 0}

I feel like I burned the candle too brightly with Chase and Amex; Amex hasn't approved me in a year and Chase hasn't approved me in 8 months, and I've followed the flow chart and the general advice very closely and I don't manufacturered spend.\n\nI think it's more important for the long game to establish relationships with every bank (perhaps while your credit file is rather thin), taking a lap around the board and getting a card from every bank before you go hard on a single one of them (in order of whatever offers are at an all-time-high of course). Do all the bank bonuses when they're juicy but considering leaving the accounts open until you've been approved for a card or two, since there's a few banks that loosen their approval rules if you're using their checking accts.\n\nLike, IMHO, Citi Premier should be one of the first cards opened because that card is incredibly inquiry sensitive. Also, you can downgrade it to the Custom Cash, which will come in handy if you're ever involuntarily between SUBs and you can use it to get 5% back on buying discounted gift cards at places like Meijer, Costco or Sam's. \n\nI only make $50k a year and only have the bare minimum of a business, so maybe being this cautious isn't necessary for people who make more.", "label": 0}
