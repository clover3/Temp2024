While there was some critical early work in the 1950s & 60s (and a variety of important qualitative observations going back to the late 1800s), anything even approaching a quantitative attempt at understanding the relationship between simple things like slope and erosion rate in upland landscapes didn't really enter the literature until the 1970s (e.g., [Ahnert, 1970](https://ajsonline.org/article/59380), [Kirkby, 1971](http://geomorphology.sese.asu.edu/Papers/Kirkby_1971.pdf)) and major breakthroughs in quantitative understanding of process laws for hillslopes weren't really robust until the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., [Dietrich et al., 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.3360090311), [Heimsath et al., 1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/41056), [Roering et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2001JB000323), etc.). \n\n>I went to a summer forestry camp back in the 1970s and the biologists told us that clear-cutting forests did not cause too much soil erosion, but that it was the equipment and trucks that caused the problem by tearing up the roots and forming ruts/roads.\n\nEven in the 1970s this wasn't particularly well born out. E.g., [Swanson & Dyrness, 1975](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/3/7/393/192245/Impact-of-clear-cutting-and-road-construction-on) do show that areas around logging roads were eroding extremely fast, but in general the clear cut areas (away from roads) were still eroding >2x the rate of non-clear cut areas. Alternatively, [Brown & Krygier, 1971](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR007i005p01189) show that hillslope erosion increased 2x from road construction, but 3x once clear-cutting began. Subsequent work has demonstrated the myriad of impacts of clear-cutting on hillslope processes, e.g., changing the hydrology which lead to enhanced erosion (e.g., [Mohr et al., 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrf.20047)) and an increase in landslides following clear-cutting (e.g., [Saito et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X16302276)).\n\n>He showed us a hillside that they had killed off all the vegetation with an herbicide (paraquat?!), but there was no erosion off it.\n\nTimescale is important here.

This is generally more temporary and part of a crash. While I'm fairly abreast of the overall state of the science regarding these conditions, often a specific symptom can be worked backwards to a pathophysiological pathway even if an actual cause is not known (this is how we manage symptoms, after all), which is why I was curious if maybe there was a specific aspect of immune response that could cause this particular symptom bundle.

{"text": "Yes, there are indeed! The whole field of microbiology is built around cultivating and understanding microbes.

We have a decent understanding of the number of microbial species in different types of samples based on DNA sequencing. We have a LOT of cultures from eg [human, mouse, and cow guts ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5628658/). \n\nThe tricky thing about culturing microbes is that, like anything living, they all have different needs and preferences. Some need oxygen to grow, some are poisoned by oxygen, some grow on different sugar, some need sunlight, some like it got, some like it cold, some like acid, some like to only grow on surfaces, some only grow in liquid, etc. You need different types of culture media to grow different types of microbes.

{"text": "Not exactly, but, botulinum. \n\nWe're not so much immune to it, as the circumstances simply make it a non-hazard to an adult Human who is not immunocompromised. \n\nIt's a relatively common bacterium to be found in honey, which is why you're not supposed to give honey to infants under the age of 1 and individuals who are immunocompromised. \n\nSee, it's not the bacteria itself that makes us sick, it's the waste that it produces that is a neurotoxin. That is why, despite killing almost all botulinum the moment you open a contaminated can, you'll still get sick. The bacteria is dead, but the waste is still present in the food. And when you ingest that waste, you are being poisoned. \n\nHowever, due to the nature of honey, botulinum that contaminates it is forced to go into its spore phase before it can produce the waste that makes Humans sick. These spores are very hardy. When a healthy adult Human consumes these spores, the bacteria reawakens. However, because of how inhospitable the Human digestive tract is, most are very quickly killed off. The few that survive will be unable to reproduce, as the bacteria that has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to, not only survive, but thrive in the Human digestive tract, outcompetes the few botulinum suvivors. The bacteria is unable to produce enough waste from living as it can't reproduce in the first place. Effectively, though not immune, the Human body has enough to defensive layers to keep us safe from botulinum spores and prevent them from harming us. So long as we don't consume botulinum waste, our bodies are very good at dealing with it. \n\nThe reason why infants under the age of 1 and immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk for contracting botulism from honey (called infant botulism in this form, even if the victim isn't an infant) is because the gastrointestinal tract of a Human infant is very clean. Which is ***not*** a good thing. \n\nAs the baby grows and begins moving from milk to solids, bacteria that has evolved to live in the Human digestive tract is introduced from the solid food to the Human baby, it begins colonizing the baby's gut. On top of that, their stomach acid is not nearly as acidic as an adult's. Which means that for about the first year of their life, their stomach is essentially open for any bacteria to colonize. This is ***very*** bad. As when you consume botulinum waste, you get a set dosage. The waste can't reproduce. But if botulinum colonizes your gastrointestinal tract, it is constantly producing more and more neurotoxic waste as it continues to reproduce and go through its lifecycle. \n\nSo, essentially, while not immune to botulinum, the circumstances in which it is introduced to the Human body makes it, effectively, a non-threat for most people.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yes and no.\n\nDepending on the energy scale you are interested in (Are we talking about room temperature atoms? Or nuclei in a reactor?), nuclei can be treated approximately as having specific configurations of protons and neutrons (the two are essentially treated separately to start) in the same way that atoms have electrons in specific configurations. You can see from [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/35724/what-is-an-intuitive-picture-of-the-motion-of-nucleons) as having s-orbitals and p-orbitals and so on. But, these orbitals have much greater overlap in the case of nuclei than they do for electrons, so a model of many nuclei as existing in copies of these individual orbitals does not agree nearly as well with the data as it does for electrons.\n\nFor atoms at room temperature, the electron configuration of an atom is almost always the most stable, lowest energy state (the ground state). The energy required to move electrons between the ground and first excited states is typically 100-1000x greater than the average kinetic energy of atoms in a gas at room temperature. So, it is a rare occurrence for a collision to cause a jump to an excited electron state. And when that does happen, the lifetime is typically quite short, a small fraction of a second. So at human timescales, it is basically correct to think of electrons in an atom as existing in a certain configuration.\n\nHowever, there is a much smaller gap between the ground (most-stable) and the many excited vibrational states of a typical nucleus. At room temperature, the kinetic energy of atoms is roughly comparable to the gap between excited states of the nuclei. Therefore, it is quite common for an atom at room temperature to have its nucleus **not** be in the ground vibrational state. In fact, the typical nucleus will exist in a super-position of many different vibrational states. \n\nTherefore, we can approximately think of nuclei as having many relatively stable configurations and the constituents of your average nucleus will be frequently transitioning between these various approximately stable states. Within each state, the configurations of the protons and neutrons do not necessarily correspond to independent orbitals for each proton/neutron (like with electrons); instead you have to think of their behavior as being much more collective than that. Exactly which state you catch a nucleus in at a particular time is impossible to predict precisely.", "label": 0}

Nope.\n\nIf your friend was basically washing his hands, but with alcohol, it's quite likely his hands were clean.

{"text": "The main limiting factors in human healing and cell regeneration involve several biological processes and constraints, including the type of cells involved, the body's regenerative capabilities, and specific molecular and environmental factors. Here are some key limitations:\n\n1. Cell Type and Regenerative Capacity\n\nLimited Regenerative Ability in Some Tissues: Different tissues have varying capacities for regeneration. For example, skin and liver cells regenerate relatively well, while other tissues, like heart muscle or neurons in the central nervous system, have limited regenerative capacity. This is partly due to differences in cell types and how they respond to injury.\n\nStem Cell Availability: In tissues with high regenerative capacity, like skin, blood, and intestines, resident stem cells can actively divide and replace lost cells. In contrast, tissues like cardiac muscle and neurons have very few stem cells, limiting their ability to regenerate after major injuries.\n\n\n2. Scarring and Fibrosis\n\nFibroblast Activity: When tissue is damaged, fibroblasts (a type of connective tissue cell) play a significant role in wound healing by producing collagen and forming scar tissue. However, this scarring process can replace damaged tissue with fibrous, non-functional tissue rather than regenerating the original tissue structure. While scar tissue closes the wound, it doesn\u2019t restore the same function or structure as the original cells.\n\nExcessive Fibrosis: In severe injuries, excessive scarring (fibrosis) can disrupt the architecture and function of tissues, like in the liver with cirrhosis or in the heart after a heart attack. Fibrosis serves as a temporary fix to restore structural integrity, but it limits complete functional recovery.\n\n\n3. Molecular Signals and Growth Factors\n\nRegenerative Signals Decline with Age: The ability to regenerate declines with age, as certain growth factors and signaling pathways (like the Wnt pathway, Hedgehog signaling, and others) decrease in activity. These pathways play key roles in tissue growth and repair. Over time, reduced production of these signals leads to slower and less complete healing.\n\nInflammatory Response: Inflammatory cells release signals that trigger healing, but prolonged or excessive inflammation can damage tissues and impede regeneration. Proper timing and regulation of inflammation are crucial, but the process often becomes less controlled with age or in chronic conditions.\n\n\n4. Cell Senescence and Telomere Shortening\n\nCell Senescence: Cells can enter a state called senescence, where they stop dividing in response to DNA damage or stress. While senescence prevents damaged cells from proliferating (which could lead to cancer), it also limits regenerative potential. As more cells become senescent over time, the body's ability to replace damaged cells diminishes.\n\nTelomere Shortening: With each cell division, telomeres (protective caps on the ends of chromosomes) shorten. When telomeres become too short, cells stop dividing, which restricts the regenerative capacity in tissues with rapidly dividing cells.\n\n\n5. Complexity of Tissue Architecture\n\nDifficulty in Rebuilding Complex Structures: Some tissues have complex architectures that are difficult to rebuild accurately. For example, the layered structure of skin, the alignment of muscle fibers, or the intricate connections in neural networks are challenging to restore once disrupted. Healing processes don\u2019t always reconstruct the original structure perfectly, so they often produce simpler, less functional tissue instead.\n\n\nPotential for Future Advances\n\nStem Cell Therapy and Tissue Engineering: Research into stem cell therapy, gene editing, and tissue engineering is promising and aims to address some of these limitations by introducing new cells or genetic instructions to repair damaged tissues more effectively.\n\nReactivation of Regenerative Pathways: Some studies focus on reactivating developmental or regenerative pathways (like in axolotls or zebrafish) to encourage regeneration in humans, though this is still largely experimental.\n\n\nIn summary, the limiting factors for human healing involve cell type, scarring, age-related molecular changes, and the inherent complexity of tissue structures. While our bodies are equipped for basic healing, complex and extensive regeneration remains limited due to these biological constraints.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This pattern of cold and flu symptoms moving through different stages\u2014like sore throat, runny nose, and then cough\u2014actually reflects the way respiratory viruses spread and interact with your body\u2019s immune response across different tissues.\n\n1. Viral Spread and Tissue Specificity\n\nInitial Infection in the Throat: Most cold and flu viruses, like rhinoviruses and influenza, enter the body through the nose or mouth and initially infect cells in the upper respiratory tract, which includes the throat. This is why a sore throat is often the first symptom, as the virus starts replicating there, triggering localized inflammation.\n\nSpread to Nasal Passages: As the virus multiplies, it often moves from the throat to the nasal passages, where it infects nasal cells and causes them to release fluid. This fluid release, combined with the immune system\u2019s response to the virus, leads to a runny or \u201csnotty\u201d nose as a primary symptom in the next stage.\n\n\n2. Immune Response Timing and Phases\n\nLocalized Immune Response in Stages: The immune system activates in waves to target the virus where it\u2019s currently concentrated. In the throat, the immune response may lead to soreness and inflammation, which begins to subside as the virus moves to the nasal passages. Your body\u2019s immune response follows the virus, leading to a noticeable shift in symptoms from sore throat to nasal congestion.\n\nResidual Effects and the Cough Stage: By the time the virus reaches the lower respiratory tract (like the bronchi), the immune system is fully activated. The throat and nasal passages are mostly clear, but the immune response can cause lingering inflammation in the bronchi, leading to a cough that can last weeks as the tissues heal.\n\n\n3. The Role of Mucus and Clearing Mechanisms\n\nCough as a Clearing Mechanism: Mucus production increases throughout the respiratory tract to trap and expel viral particles. The body uses the cough reflex to clear this mucus from the lower respiratory tract, which can explain why the cough stage persists long after the virus has largely been neutralized.\n\n\n4. Why Symptoms Aren't Cumulative\n\nSymptom \"Phasing Out\": Since the immune system is highly localized and adaptive, it tends to focus on one area of infection at a time. As the virus moves down the respiratory tract, the immune response in the upper regions subsides, reducing symptoms in those areas. This can create the illusion of separate stages that follow one another.\n\n\n5. Virus Shedding Patterns\n\nTiming of Peak Infectiousness: During each stage, viral particles are shed in high amounts from the affected tissues. This means that when the virus is in the throat, it's more easily spread through coughing or sneezing; as it moves lower, your body primarily expels it through coughing.\n\n\nIn summary, the progression from sore throat to runny nose to cough reflects both the virus\u2019s movement through the respiratory tract and the immune system\u2019s phased response. Each phase has a \u201cprimary\u201d symptom, and the body\u2019s immune system contains the infection in one area before reacting to the next, which is why it feels like distinct stages rather than a cumulative effect. Fascinatingly, this staged response helps your body efficiently manage and clear the virus while minimizing overall tissue damage.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The process by which blood cells generated in the bone marrow enter the bloodstream is fascinating. In hematopoiesis, blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) are produced in the bone marrow, particularly in long bones like the femur and flat bones like the pelvis. Once matured, these cells need to move from the marrow into the bloodstream, and they do this through a highly specialized mechanism.\n\n1. The Role of Sinusoids\n\nThe bone marrow contains a network of sinusoids, which are thin-walled blood vessels with large, permeable endothelial cells. These sinusoids serve as conduits, connecting the bone marrow to the bloodstream and allowing blood cells to pass through.\n\nOnce blood cells are mature and ready to enter circulation, they move to the sinusoidal walls, where they encounter endothelial cells lining the sinusoids.\n\n\n2. Transendothelial Migration\n\nTo cross from the bone marrow into the blood vessels, blood cells undergo transendothelial migration (also called \u201cdiapedesis\u201d). The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids have gaps or fenestrations that allow cells to pass through without disrupting the vessel\u2019s integrity.\n\nChemical signals from the bloodstream and bone marrow help guide the cells, causing endothelial cells to loosen their junctions temporarily, allowing mature blood cells to slip into the sinusoids.\n\n\n3. Pressure Gradients\n\nThe pressure gradient between the bone marrow and the bloodstream assists in moving cells from the marrow through the sinusoids and into circulation. The higher pressure within the marrow helps push cells into the lower-pressure sinusoids, facilitating their movement out of the bone.\n\n\n4. Selective Release\n\nThis process is regulated carefully to ensure only mature, functional cells enter the bloodstream. Immature blood cells generally remain in the marrow until they fully mature, thanks to signals and structural barriers within the marrow\u2019s microenvironment.\n\n\nIn summary, blood cells travel through fenestrations in the sinusoidal blood vessels of the bone marrow, guided by pressure gradients and chemical signals that allow for smooth, regulated entry into the bloodstream. This highly organized process keeps immature cells in place until they\u2019re ready, ensuring that only fully functional blood cells circulate.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Yes, if a baseball\u2019s seams were indented instead of raised, it would likely move and behave quite differently. The seams on a baseball play a crucial role in how the ball interacts with air as it travels, affecting both its speed and movement.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how indented seams might change things:\n\n1. Reduced Drag and Lift\n\nDrag: Raised seams create turbulence in the airflow around the ball, which can actually reduce drag by creating a thin turbulent layer close to the surface, allowing the ball to travel faster. With indented seams, the ball would likely experience a smoother airflow, increasing drag and possibly reducing the ball's speed.\n\nLift and Movement: The Magnus effect, which causes a spinning ball to curve, relies on the seams to create asymmetric airflow. Raised seams catch more air, making the ball easier to manipulate. With indented seams, the ball wouldn\u2019t \u201cgrab\u201d the air as effectively, leading to less pronounced movement on pitches like curveballs and sliders.\n\n\n2. Spin and Pitch Control\n\nRaised seams give pitchers a grip that helps them control spin rate and angle, essential for pitches with lateral or vertical movement. Indented seams would likely make it harder to generate the same spin, leading to flatter pitches and less \u201cbreak\u201d on breaking balls. Fastballs, curveballs, and sliders would likely be less effective or look different in their flight paths.\n\n\n3. Knuckleball Behavior\n\nThe knuckleball might be the pitch least affected by indented seams. Knuckleballs rely on minimal spin, with the raised seams causing unpredictable airflows that make the ball \u201cdance\u201d toward the plate. With indented seams, the movement of a knuckleball could become more predictable, as the airflow would be smoother, leading to less erratic behavior.\n\n\n4. Grip and Pitcher Control\n\nPitchers rely on the raised seams to control the ball and apply precise finger pressure. Indented seams could reduce grip, making it harder to control pitch release and spin. This might lead to more wild pitches or less effective pitch location.\n\n\nIn Summary\n\nWith indented seams, baseballs would likely travel slower, break less, and be harder to control, fundamentally changing the dynamics of pitching and potentially reducing the variety of pitches pitchers could effectively throw. The raised seams are integral to how baseballs move through the air and interact with spin, making them essential to the game\u2019s physics.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Lakes can become deeper through a few natural and human-influenced processes. Here's how it happens:\n\n1. Erosion and Sediment Removal\n\nRiver and Stream Erosion: Rivers and streams that feed into a lake can erode the land around and underneath the lake over time, slowly carving it deeper. This erosion can deepen the lake basin, especially in areas with strong water flow or loose soil and rock.\n\nWave Erosion: Wind-driven waves can erode the shoreline and lake bed, especially in shallow areas near the edges. Over time, this can lead to a gradual increase in depth around the lake's perimeter.\n\n\n2. Glacial Activity\n\nMany of the world\u2019s deepest lakes, like the Great Lakes in North America, were formed by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Glaciers acted like massive chisels, scraping and digging out the land beneath them. As glaciers retreated, they left behind these deep basins, which filled with water to become lakes.\n\nIn regions still influenced by glacial activity, such as certain parts of Alaska or the Himalayas, glaciers can continue to shape and deepen lake basins over time.\n\n\n3. Tectonic Activity\n\nFaulting and Land Subsidence: In tectonically active areas, the Earth\u2019s crust can shift, creating or deepening lake basins. For instance, the deepest lake in the world, Lake Baikal in Siberia, sits in a rift valley where tectonic activity has caused the land to sink, forming a deep lake.\n\nVolcanic Activity: Some lakes form in volcanic craters, and volcanic activity can sometimes deepen these basins. As the magma chamber below collapses or subsides, it can make the lake basin deeper over time.\n\n\n4. Human Activity\n\nDredging: Humans can deepen lakes artificially by dredging, which involves scooping sediment and debris from the bottom of the lake. Dredging is often done to maintain waterways, prevent flooding, or improve water quality by removing built-up sediment.\n\nDam Construction: Building a dam can cause water to back up, filling up valleys and making the water body significantly deeper than it was naturally.\n\n\n5. Sediment Balance and Reduction\n\nReduction in Sediment Inflow: Sometimes, a lake will naturally deepen if the inflow of sediment decreases. For instance, if vegetation upstream is restored, it can reduce the amount of soil and sediment washed into the lake, preventing it from filling in and allowing natural erosion to deepen the lake bed gradually.\n\n\nIn summary, lakes become deeper through natural processes like erosion, glacial and tectonic activity, and, in some cases, human intervention. These processes work slowly, often over thousands or millions of years, to shape the depth and contours of lake basins.", "label": 0}

The light is a kind of [cyclotron radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation).  It is not at very specific wavelengths, like atomic emission.  Instead, it has a continuous spectrum similar to, but not the same as, thermal emission.  Other objects like pulsars also emit the same type of radiation for similar reasons.

Similar to your bird and power line comment. \n\nIt\u2019s important to notice the necessary context of the conversation. The timescale we normally use to talk about adaptations, and the timescale this conversation refers to. \n\nHuman technological adaptation, outpaces evolutionary adaptation, by orders of magnitude. Power-lines, and asphalt roads, literally didn\u2019t exist 500 years ago. On the scale we use to talk about evolution timelines, power-lines and asphalt roads are an extremely small blip of time. And in 500 years, it\u2019s not unreasonable to argue that all power-lines and asphalt roads are obsolete, and decommissioned. \n\nAlmost necessarily, we\u2019re only going to find evidence of animals adapting to human technology, from animals that breed so rapidly, that it matches/exceeds that time scale. The conversation/evidence is only really going to exist, in the way you\u2019re looking for it, from animals like birds/insects/bacteria.

In this case, we have these relationships:\n\n\n> Mechanical Force (F) <-> Voltage or Electromotive Force (V)\n\n\n> Mechanical Velocity (v) <-> Electric Current (I)\n\n\nYou can think of both force and voltage as measuring potential energy, and both velocity and current as measuring some kind of energy flow.\n\n\nIn the case of both an ideal resistor and ideal spring, there's a relationship between the input potential and the resulting flow. The value describing that relationship is called the \"Impedance\" (with the symbol Z). That relationship works out where the flow created when a potential is applied has an inverse relationship. That is,\n\n\n> Flow = Potential/Impedance <-> v = F/Z <-> I = V/Z\n\n\nWhen things are put \"in parallel,\" what that really means is that they experience the same potential. Because they experience that potential, they generate the flow given by their impedance. The total flow is equal to the sum of each flow. When we try to find an \"equivalent\" resistor or \"equivalent\" spring,\u00a0 what we really mean is that we want to know the Impedance of a single object that results in the same total flow when experiencing that potential.\n\n\nPut in math terms for an mechanical system:\n\n\n> v= v1 + v2 = (F/Z1) + (F/Z2) = F * (1/Z1 + 1/Z2)\n\n\nAnd for electrical:\n\n\n> I = I1 + I2 = (V/Z1) + (V/Z2) = V * (1/Z1 + 1/Z2)\n\n\nAnd I think you can see from those equations that the way to find the combined impedances is by adding their inverses.", "label": 0}

{"text": "There are intuitive physical explanations for all of the spring, resistor, capacitor adding rules. These can be explained on a case by cases basis. Instead, I'm going to do that after giving a more natural *philosophical* explanation.\n\nA lot of physical properties with traditional units are simultaneously measures of two properties with reciprocal relationships. By adhering to the traditional units when adding elements to a system you essentially have to convert the traditional measure into what you're adding in essence and then convert back.\n\nClassic example is two resistors in parallel. One might naively expect R + R = 2R. One element has resistance R, add a second element with resistance R, total must be 2R resistance. We know that's not correct and the correct formula is 1/(1/R + 1/R) = 1/2 R... but why is it this complicated looking formula? What's really happening?\n\nOK, same problem but instead of tracking resistance, let's express the whole thing in terms of admittance *A*. More admittance, more current. Now we add a second resistor in parallel, another path for current to be admitted on. The formula for adding admittances is *A* \\+ *A* = 2*A*. Why is this formula in a simple form instead of the three inverses before? Because we've built the conversion from resistance *into* admittance (twice) and conversation from admittance *into* resistance (once) into the formula. The three inverses are still there, just hidden. If you substitute that A = 1/R in all three cases you get the previous relationship.\n\nIt takes some understanding that adding resistors in series is *adding more resistance* while adding resistors in parallel is *adding more admittance*. Yes, you're adding a resistor in both cases but where you add it changes the thing that you're adding. Is this another burden to electrical current or is this another pathway?\n\nIt's all a consequence of naturally adding A + A = 2A but expressing that in terms of Bs when A = 1/B.", "label": 0}

{"text": "As people have pointed out, the immune system is the name we give to many defenses that all work slightly differently in order to protect us from pathogens. Even different bacteria can cause a slightly different immune response that is optimized to fight them in the best way. The part of the immune system that is involved with allergies is also the part of the immune system that has some activity against parasites (though I think about this more like a diagnostic clue instead of something that\u2019s being super effective).\u00a0\n\nFor the most part, we call someone immune compromised when their ability to fight off infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi is abnormal. People can be immunocompromised due to factors like genetics, taking immunosuppressive medications or medications that stop the production of immune cells, or because they\u2019re not getting enough nutrition to make necessary protein.\u00a0\n\nIs the part of the immune system responsible for allergies less active in the above conditions? Depends on what type of immune suppression. If you\u2019re severely malnourished and not making any proteins or undergoing chemotherapy and are not making any new white blood cells, then theoretically you could have a reduction in allergic response. So someone who is starving might notice a reduction in their spring allergies while they\u2019re acutely malnourished. But if you have a genetic defect in a specific type of white blood cell like a neutrophil (which can lead to deadly infections!), there wouldn\u2019t be a significant reduction in the production of the type of cell and antibody responsible for allergic reactions.\n\nClinically, this doesn\u2019t end up meaning a whole lot. I wouldn\u2019t tells someone with a peanut allergy that they can eat a Reeses because they\u2019re on an anti-organ rejection med or because they\u2019re taking corticosteroids for asthma. Even someone with residual allergic/immune function could mount a dangerous response if they are unlucky.\n\nCould someone who is immune compromised be less likely to *develop* allergies? Sure, that\u2019s possible, but probably not in a way that impacts a lot of people. Most allergic sensitization happens in childhood, and if you\u2019re seriously immune suppressed in childhood, it\u2019s more likely to be due to a specific genetic disease (which doesn\u2019t affect allergies) or because you\u2019re critically ill (which creates so many other additional variables that I don\u2019t think it would be possible to correlate). Adults have likely already become sensitized to whatever they\u2019re allergic to in childhood, and so being immune compromised might lessen their allergic response to known triggers, but isn\u2019t going to cure an allergy. But it all depends on the type of immune suppression!", "label": 0}

Classically, IgE binds to cells with an IgE receptor (think lock and key) then these cells will release cytokines responsible for the allergic reaction. Hence, once would think no IgE = no allergy. However, there are certain antigens or substances than can bind to other receptors on the same cells and cause an allergic reaction. IgG for example can also do this. There are even drugs that can exacerbate allergies by directly activating those receptors.

{"text": "A sonic boom is a pressure wave. I mean, all sound is pressure waves, but a sonic boom is a particularly gnarly one.\n\nA pressure wave is created because something pushes against the medium - in this case air - to compress it. This could be the diaphragm of a loudspeaker, for instance, or a vibrating string (things that vibrate will alternately compress the neighboring air, and then let it expand again). What's key is that a bunch of molecules are all being pushed in the same direction. This in turn pushes away molecules that were in their way, and they push on other molecules, and so on, and so the increased pressure (from molecules temporarily being packed together more closely) propagates through the air, away from the source.\n\nThe speed at which pressure waves can propagate through a medium is the speed of sound (because that's what sound *is*), and it depends on the medium. The speed of sound in a solid medium is faster, for instance, because the molecules are connected by rigid bonds, and so as soon as one molecule tries to move it pushes on its bonds and the force gets transmitted to neighboring molecules very quickly. In a gas, the gaps between molecules are larger and they aren't bound to each other, so you need molecules to \"cross the gaps\" between them and collide, in order for forces to be transmitted through the medium, and this is a slower process.\n\nA single molecule in the air may be moving much faster than the speed of sound, because sound is not the speed of individual molecules - it's the speed with which forces, and therefore also waves of pressure, can be transmitted through the interactions between molecules. \n\nSonic booms happen when an object travels through a medium, thereby creating pressure waves, and because it travels faster than the speed of sound, the object travels faster than the pressure waves it leaves behind. So instead of a wavefront that leads the object, arriving sooner than the object does (as happens at subsonic speeds of travel), all the pressure waves that the object created along its course arrive shortly after the object passes you, and add together into one big \"boom\" of sound.\n\nA single molecule traveling faster than the speed of sound does not have the same effect, because it's too small to create a concerted wave of pressure. One molecule may push another out of its way, but it will not push a whole bunch of molecules all at once, and colliding with even a single other molecule will alter the first molecule's own course as well.", "label": 0}

It\u2019s slightly slower than the average velocity of the particles themselves because they are frequently colliding with other particles and not traveling in a straight line.

{"text": "Depends on what time frame you're considering, but broadly, the uncertainty on, and our confidence in, plate reconstructions goes down as we consider older periods. We can take a look at a few sets of plate reconstructions to get a sense of this, e.g., various aspects of the reconstructions in [Matthews et al. (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818116302417) and [Young et al. (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987118301373) are directly compared in [Williams et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987120301432) and similarly, various aspects of reconstructions in [Seton et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825212000311) and [Merdith et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825220305237) are compared in [Seton et al. (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00384-8). If we look at those comparisons (which is a bit easier than trying to match up the reconstructions ourselves), we can see that they largely agree going back to ~200 million years ago (and some, like Seton et al. (2012) only extend that far in the first place). \n\nSo what's special about the period from 200 million years ago to now? It represents the period of time for which we still have at least some (and in the case of more geologically recent periods, *a lot*) of constraint on plate motion from preserved magnetic anomalies in the sea floors (for more info on that, see details on [sea floor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading)). Beyond 200-250 million years, our primary dataset is instead paleogeographic locations of portions of continental crust as determined by [paleomagnetic datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_reconstruction#Paleomagnetic_data:_Sampling). We use these in the 200-250 million time frame as well, but they're less ambiguous when paired with constraint provided by records of sea floor spreading. The paleomagnetic data from continents give us good constraints on the paleolatitude of the sampled areas, but (1) they don't constrain longitude, (2) the data does not tell us about locations or types of tectonic boundaries (e.g., subduction zones, mid-ocean ridges, etc.), and (3) depending on data density it might not fully constrain the orientation of a continental block. Some of those, like point 2, can be partially filled in with other data, e.g., more basic geologic observations of the type of deformation preserved in rocks can help inform on the type and location of tectonic plate boundaries in the past, but broadly, some amount of ambiguity persists in the absence of a more \"complete\" record of plate motion that we get from having preserved ocean floor. Additionally, as we move further back in time, there is generally just less rock of a given age available, so our datasets of various kinds become sparser. All of that combined means that the details of plate reconstructions, and thus plate movement, become less certain as we move further back in time with a pretty notable jump in uncertainty and/or disagreement between different reconstructions beyond ~200 million years ago.\n\nThat being said, there have been a lot of advances in reconstructions in the last decade that have begun to narrow that uncertainty. Part of this is just continuing to improve the record of paleomagnetic data and general geologic observations from the continents, but as described in many of the papers cited above (e.g., Merdith et al., 2021 and Seton et al., 2023 especially), we've added in a lot of additional approaches to improve reconstructions which have generally decreased the degree of difference between alternative reconstructions. Some of those include more quantitative tools for doing reconstructions (e.g., like [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/)) that help to ensure reconstructions \"follow the rules\" of plate tectonics (i.e., honor kinematic constraints on plate movements on a sphere, behavior of types of boundaries, etc.) and incorporation of additional data to reconstructions, like using details of subducted slabs visible in [seismic tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_tomography) data to add constraint on subducted portions of ocean basins (e.g., [Clennett et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GC009117), [Fuston & Wu, 2021](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/133/5-6/1128/592051/Raising-the-Resurrection-plate-from-an-unfolded)). The effect of those improvements are visible in efforts like Merdith et al., 2021, which presents a continuous reconstruction from 1 billion years to present, which no one would have probably attempted 20+ years ago because the data and methods just weren't really there to make continuous reconstructions like that anything more than a lot of fantasy. That's not to say there are not *huge* uncertainties in many of the details in (especially the older time slices of) reconstructions like those presented by Merdith et al., but the fact that a vaguely reasonable set of reconstructions can be produced that far back is technically quite impressive.", "label": 0}

{"text": "If you just take two pieces of material and stick them together to make them barely supercritical, the nuclear reactions will heat the material up, and if there's enough of it to keep the fission going, it'll eventually heat enough to melt, and it'll spread out until it's no longer critical.\n\nThe faster you get the reaction to happen, the faster it heats up, and the faster it separates. Eventually you've got it reacting *so* fast that in the first few moments, such a huge amounts of energy is released and dumped into the surrounding material that it just blows itself apart before much of it can fission at all. Imagine trying to take a container of water that's full to the brim and evaporate it: if you just turn the heat up as high as it goes as fast as you can, a lot of it will end up splashed out by the violent expansion of the steam bubbles as they get to the surface, rather than actually being on the heat long enough to vaporize into steam. On the other hand, if you heated it to 90C, it would slowly evaporate into water vapor without ever boiling, and you'd get a much more complete reaction, but one that's a lot slower.\n\nThe problem with creating a nuclear explosion is you need to make enough things react fast enough and dump so much energy so fast that you get a boom and not a melt, while keeping everything together long enough for the boom to build rather than fizzle out. That's literally what a fizzle is, the nuclear reaction started, but the fissile blew apart before enough of it could undergo fission to reach the desired size. One of the ways of both getting enough material reacting, and holding it together long enough, is implosion.\n\nBy crushing the fissile inward at ~10km/s, the resulting nuclear explosion has to overcome that inward momentum before it can expand outwards enough to drop below critical mass. But crushing it also *radically* increases the amount fissions happening. We're used to thinking of metal as being incompressible, but under these kinds of forces, it's not - off the top of my head, I believe I remember reading that Trinity/Fat Man's target was a 2.6x increase in density (very, very roughly crushing a soda can-sized chunk of plutonium down to the size of a billiards ball). It literally brings the atoms closer together, shrinking the space between them so that the fission neutrons are more likely to \"hit\" another atom and trigger a new fission event, and they do so faster, with less distance traveled.\n\nThe result is that nuclear explosions are *fast*. A \"shake\" is a measurement of how long approximately one generation of fission events takes, 10 nanoseconds, and the *entire* nuclear yield in a single-stage weapon is a few dozen shakes (hundreds of nanoseconds, or fractions-of-a-millionth of a second). And since it's exponential growth, the vast majority of the yield is just in the last few generations. Many of the early post-WW2 experiments were about tinkering with minute details of design to hold the fissile together just a few nanoseconds longer.\n\nI doubt even a \"perfect\" neutron reflector would come close to that, because the element of time isn't being reduced in the same extreme way. Either you'd only get melting, or maybe a small explosion as the material rapidly heats but blows apart before much of it actually undergoes fission. You'd have to compensate somehow, like by simply having more fissile. Compare Fat Man, which used compression, had ~56% of a spherical critical mass worth of fissile, of which ~16% underwent fission, with Little Boy, which had minimal compression, ~114% of a spherical critical mass worth of fissile, of which ~1.5% underwent fission. Both designs used neutron reflectors already.\n\nIn addition, an extra source of neutrons is usually (always?) used in implosion weapons, to provide extra high-energy neutrons at the right fraction of a microsecond when the weapon's nearing maximum compression to initiate a flood of new fission events. Without those, the weapon either has a reduced yield or fizzles entirely. My understanding of the designs is that they generally use the implosion itself to trigger them mechanically, either destroying layers of metal protecting the fissile from being exposed them, or crushing them into pressures that initiates a small fusion reaction, so simply adding a reflector won't do much.", "label": 0}

{"text": "...\n\nSo, a lot of focus on how a single molecule isn't big enough to do anything other than collide with another air molecule and bounce off.\n\nWhich is great, that's important and all.  But the more important thing to understand here is the reason that gases can propagate sound *at all* is because the molecules are moving fast enough to bounce off each other like that.  Of course, that's also the reason that the matter is in a gas phase rather than liquid or solid.\n\nLet's go back to how sound waves work at a very basic level.  Take a solid.  You can think of all the molecules as weights being connected with little springs or something.  You smack one molecule to impart some momentum, it passes the momentum to the molecules around it through the springs, this creates a compression wave (followed by a tension wave) that goes through the solid.  Very easy to visualize and model at macro scale with little weights and springs.\n\nNow in a liquid, you don't have a fixed structure anymore, but we can still surround each weight with a little bit of foam rubber so that they can slide around each other but still bounce a bit.  Now, liquids require a bit of pressure to keep from evaporating, so we'll model that in by putting all the bouncy balls in a stretchy container that presses them together slightly.  So while they can move around each other, they still stay in contact.  When you impart a bit of momentum to a molecule, it still does the compression wave followed by a \"reduced below the constraining pressure\" wave.\n\nIn a gas the balls in our model are basically no longer touching each other.  If you hit one, it doesn't immediately transfer energy to it's neighbors in a \"wave\", it just goes until it hits something else.  But here's the thing, that's only if the balls aren't already moving fast enough to not all just fall on the ground.  And that's exactly what *literally* happens to molecules if they aren't moving fast enough, they all fall to the ground and condense into a liquid.  This even happens in zero-g, because molecules are affected by microscale forces and clump together on any impact if they're cold (slow) enough (but they tend to want to be cold enough to form a solid).  Gas molecules *need* the kinetic motion of \"heat\" to populate a volume so much larger than their liquid phase, just like you'd have to get the balls in our model bouncing around at a good clip to keep them from all just falling on the ground and staying there.\n\nThe implication of this is that the individual motion of any ball can't produce a 'wave', it's just a single ball, and when it hits another ball (which is also bouncing around like crazy) they'll probably go off in different directions rather than have a smooth transfer that preserves the original ball's momentum intact on the second (while the second ball's momentum is entirely transferred to the first).  You need a *bunch* of balls moving in the same direction before it becomes a 'wave' where the original balls transfer their overall momentum to the balls in the way, exchanging it for the overall momentum of the balls in the way.\n\nBut you also need all those balls in the way bouncing around like crazy so that they will be in the way at all, otherwise you just have the original balls continuing on their merry way...which still transfers energy, but not as a 'wave'.  Instead you have the behavior of a *shock*wave in vacuum, which is a thing but not one we worry about much on Earth.\n\nSo, one quick takeaway here is that sonic booms are caused by shockwaves, and if you had a bunch of room temperature nitrogen gas under pressure and then suddenly released it into a vacuum, well you'd *indeed* cause a sonic boom when those molecules hit something on the other side of the vacuum.  And I guess you could think of a single molecule of nitrogen in a vacuum as a very tiny sonic boom...but it's not, it's just a single molecule that goes to a particular place and makes an impact too tiny to be called a \"boom\".\n\nBut back on Earth where we have air all around that is made of a bunch of other molecules zipping about in different directions, our single molecule is just another nitrogen molecule in the air (mostly nitrogen).  It is the action of all the molecules zipping about and hitting each other and any solid/liquid surface exposed to the air that creates \"air pressure\", without which we have a vacuum and thus no sound.  One way to create this vacuum is by cooling down the molecules so that they just stick to whatever they hit (normally by making the surfaces they can stick too very cold, but there are other ways to do it).  That's another way of stating that we slowed down all the other molecules so that our single high-speed molecule is actually doing something different from them.\n\nBut if we *don't* do that, well then all the other molecules (nitrogen etc.) are bouncing around like crazy in every different direction, what you get from any single molecule isn't just too small to count as a \"boom\", whatever impact it has is drowned out by the continually countless other impacts from all the other molecules moving in every direction, which we aggregate together into \"air pressure\", acting on both non-gas phase surfaces exposed to this air and on the air itself.  That's why we can have sound waves propagate through air or any other gas, and so the speed of sound tends to be restricted to something less than the speed of the kinetic energy of \"heat\" at a given temperature, without which we cannot have gas pressure (you can actually have gas at basically zero pressure, but this mostly requires an enormous volume of space for there to be any significant amount of actual gas molecules, so it kinda is something you mostly see in space).\n\nAnyway, this is all probably about as clear as mud.  I just don't know how to make it any clearer.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> Thank you for the insight. But might I ask why does the body use ROS and RNS if it damages its own nearby cells?\n\nThe why and how are interwoven, so....\n\nWhy - ROS and RNS are highly reactive molecules that can damage cellular components like DNA, proteins, and lipids. This makes them effective at killing bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that macrophages and other immune cells ingest. The body\u2019s primary goal in releasing ROS and RNS is to destroy invaders, even if it means causing some harm to surrounding cells.\n\nHow - ROS and RNS are extremely reactive because they have unpaired electrons, making them unstable and eager to interact with other molecules. When ROS or RNS encounter cell components like DNA, proteins, or lipids, they react almost indiscriminately, leading to collateral damage.\n\nIn chronic infections or exposure to foreign materials (like asbestos), the immune response is prolonged, leading to sustained ROS/RNS release and cumulative damage to healthy tissue.\n\n> Are there other situations besides asbestos exposure where the macrophages release those reactive species?\n\nYes, this is far from exclusive to asbestos, all injuries cuts, burns, trauma, and so on (including diseases like heart disease or Allergic Reactions and Asthma) result in macrophages releasing ROS and RNS to clear out debris, damaged cells, and any potential pathogens. The trouble with asbestos is that it can't be broken down so the process continually damages cells and raises the risk of mutation into cancerous cells.\n\nEddit - cant spell.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">Hotspots and mantle plumes are separate features of the mantle that can produce volcanism or have non-eruptive surface expressions, but they don\u2019t influence plate movements, shape or evolution.\n\nWhile we're quibbling, this also isn't exactly true. I.e., there's a variety of arguments that plume head interactions with plates **do and can** influence plate motion (e.g., [Cande & Stegman, 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10174), [van Hinsbergen et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00780-7), etc.). Even if they didn't, given that the generation of plumes is intricately linked to subduction and the interaction of subducted material with the thermochemical piles on the core-mantle boundary (i.e., LLSPVs) (e.g., see review by [Koppers et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00168-6)), it's a bit odd to argue that they are somehow not a part of tectonics in a formal sense (not to mention that the *start* of mobile lid plate tectonics on Earth has often been tied to plume interactions, e.g., [Gerya et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15752)).

{"text": "> is there any additional toxicity due to the chemistry of asbestos? (I believe your comments imply that the ROS and RNS are typical responses of macrophages but they just reach prolonged and concentrated levels in this case?)\n\nGood question, some asbestos (amphibole asbestos) contains iron that can catalyze the production of reactive ROS through the Fenton reaction When macrophages try to engulf asbestos fibers, they release hydrogen peroxide as part of their ROS response. The iron in asbestos can react with this hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals, which are among the most damaging types of ROS. This localized ROS production near asbestos fibers amplifies cellular damage.\n\nAnd yes, I had to go look that up :)", "label": 0}

{"text": "The surface chemistry of asbestos does play a role in the development of disease beyond the iron inclusion listed in the other comment. \n\nIt is very non reactive as well as promotes the adhesion of proteins. When macrophages release proteins to degrade the material, instead of being able to react with it will adsorb onto the surface rendering the protein ineffective as well as promoting different responses from the now very different looking surface to the cells.\n\n**It's also important to note that cells really are never \"seeing\" foreign bodies but proteins and molecules adsorbed onto the surface within microseconds of contact with biological fluids. How this occurs can lead to quite different outcomes in how they interact. The surface chemistry of materials in this first step is a very important part of how our body reacts to materials. \n\nFor example, we often use titanium implants, or body and cells will not ever \"see\" the bulk metal of titanium but the thin surface coating of titanium oxide and whatever contaminants are also on this surface. The proteins and constituents of blood or biological fluids will immediately interact with this surface well before a cell ever \"sees\" or \"touches\" it. \n\nThe way the proteins interact depends on the surface chemistry and contaminants greatly. Hydrophobic surfaces or very \"even\" surfaces of charge distribution tend to heavily absorb proteins that are soluble in our fluids (proteins having a hydrophilic outside and hydrophobic inside) and denature them with their hydrophobic insides smooshing across the surface. \n\nA hydrophilic surface such as clean titanium oxide will smoosh proteins to a lesser extent as their hydrophobic insides interact less with the surface. Water in our fluids is also able to interact with the surfaces as well stabilizing the adsorbed proteins.", "label": 0}

So if a bacteria could detect the presence of the antibiotic, the loss of energy when it's not present would be insignificant.\n\n\nSo there will be examples of both, as others have posted.\n\n\nBecause of those selective pressures, natural selection is going to favor the bacteria that mutate to keep resistance in their back pocket, so to speak, instead of expressing it fully all the time.\u00a0", "label": 0}
{"text": "Short answer: maybe, maybe not. These things are tough to say, mainly because the world is more connected than you might think.\n\nWe do actually observe different rates of antibiotic prescription in different regions. A lot of that is due to different regulations in different countries. Because of those differences in prescription, we also observe differences in antibiotic resistance rates to different drug classes among different countries (see [here](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196%2823%2900026-8/fulltext) for example, or [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34312-7) for a global breakdown by drug class). So in short, yes, if we suddenly stopped using antibiotic X (and we also didn't use any antibiotics with a similar method of action), we would expect to see rates of resistance to X drop. This is part of what research into antibiotic stewardship is trying to address--is there a way we could optimally rotation antibiotics to combat overall rates of resistance.\n\nLong answer: it depends. There are a few missing factors here:\n\n- Antibiotics aren't a human invention, they're a bacterial one. Antibiotics existed millions of years before we did, and they'll exist millions of years after we go extinct. Plenty of bacteria exist in nature that are antibiotic resistant to some degree because of contacts with other antibiotic-producing bacteria.\n- Not all resistance is bad *enough* to warrant reversion to senstivity, and random mutations typically lead to some degree of resistance in bacterial communities. They're not monoliths; there's variance among bacterial communities. In any given community that's capable of resistance there are likely some individuals that continue to be resistant just because (1) it's not *that* big of a cost, or (2) the rate at which the resistance strains are outcompeted eventually becomes equivalent to the rate at which resistance spontaneously arises.\n- Antibiotics aren't limited to hospitals. One of the largest users of antibiotics in the US is farms, since studies have shown that constantly supplying livestock with antibiotics (regardless of infection) leads to more growth. Those antibiotics can end up in the rainwater or sewers, and that can lead to resistance sticking around. If you have farming in a particular area, you could have high rates of resistance that are totally unrelated to any hospital activity.\n- It's also important to define what we mean by \"resistance\"--plenty of bacteria will be able to survive at certain concentrations of antibiotic but not others. The dose forms another part of the equation, where for example survival at a very low concentration of antibiotic (e.g., what you'd find in nature) has a lower impact than survival at a very high dosage of antibiotic (e.g., what you'd get in the hospital).\n- If we stop using a particular drug and instead used a drug that has a similar method of action, we'd probably not see any change in resistance since evolving resistance to both is similar. A lot of bacteria evolve resistance to certain drug classes in the same way, so (for example) resistance to one cephalosporin will give some degree of resistance to other cephalosporins. So, you'd have to ensure that the drug you stop using doesn't have collateral resistance with other drugs that are use.\n\nSo all that is to say, a single hospital not using a particular antibiotic is unlikely to make a dent in global rates of resistance, but if there were a way to change global antibiotic use, then yes, you're likely to eventually see differences in resistance rates.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Because naturally-occuring asbestos rarely appears in the highly refined form-factor found when used in the making of fireproof cloth. There are places where there is sufficient asbestos concentrations to cause hazards to human health if the dust is inhaled, but inhaling large volumes of mineral dust is harmful anyway, especially of many of the minerals in which asbestos is commonly found, like serpentine (which will kill you quicker than mesothelioma).\n\nThe environment doesn't \"de-pollute itself\", it's just that the overall quantity of toxic chemicals in the ecosystem is low enough to be tolerable to animal life. Lead is abundant in the environment than asbestos, for example, and will present much more immediate toxic effects than an eventual demise from cancer.", "label": 0}

{"text": "It's statistically flawed to think that things being a tradeoff mean you develop random weakness. Most of the time the only cost for a newly evolved trait is spending proportionally more energy and matter to build that extra body part or molecule etc. more importantly, if a new trait creates a weakness, it would have to also create selective pressure for animals with that weakness to breed less. So in cases where a weakness does arise, it is almost always proportionally weaker than the new gain. Otherwise the trait wouldn't be selected for and spread through the population.", "label": 0}

Trials of putting phages in the water fed to chickens to stop them getting ill and passing infections as food. These kind of things are really being shown to work, show that phages can be safely eaten and aren't scary (and are in fact very cheap and useful).\n\nAs antibiotic resistance keeps getting worse, there will be more pressure to combat it. The difference in science and investment between putting phages on raisins compared to injecting them into a human in a clinical trial is huge, I would estimate 1000x more investment needed. But antibiotic resistance is getting worse so I assume more things will be tried, including phage therapies.\n\nThere are people today testing whether phages attached to catheters helps prevent infections when medical equipment stays inside the body. \n\nPhages carrying extra genes (genetically engineered phage) are being tested with extra enzymes to break down gunky biofilms of bacteria, making them in theory more treatable.\n\nGenetically engineered phage that can't reproduce and therefore evolve are a good possiblity, but not well thought of at the moment. \n\nLots of different avenues to try, but nothing easy and the very slow progress is frustrating, in both treating antibiotic resistant infections and using bacteriophage therapies for anything at all.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Good question that others have put up some good answers. It is important to consider the effects of the bacteria not developing that resistance  when people are being treated. The resistance might make the bacteria grow slower but the alternative is death for the bacteria. So even with slower growth, the resistant bacteria survives and the others don't. In the grand scheme of things, as general statement (there is a lot of nuance though), the bacteria growing a bit slower but remains alive to continue to infect in many cases is enough for survival and thus is the most fit to survive there. This is the metric that bacteria \"cares\" about in that person in that scenario, which is a simple one with one bacterial type being treated with one antibiotic. In that case the bacteria with resistance is more fit for that environment even with slower growth. And keep in mind slower growth may not happen or not happen to a level that matters.  With no other factors that change is likely to be sufficient so that the patient continues to have the bacterial disease. Obviously we don't do that with just one antibiotic and often test for resistance at the outset and will use other antibiotics that may then work, but I am giving a simple example here.\n\nAs others mentioned it has other factors in the mix with the immune system also playing a role. If it does slow growth this can potentially give time for the immune system to get a upper hand, or contribute to eradication along with the antibiotic. Yet  other factors are involved like age, overall health of the patient, immune status (good or bad) so making a universal statement is hard. In other cases the bacteria may have ways of evading the immune system naturally where the immune system may not be able to get the upper hand and it needs to be done with effective drugs. \n\nAlso at play is that some bacteria can develop biofilms which make is far harder to treat. At a general level you can have a situation were free floating (planktonic) bacteria are susceptible to a drug a X concentration. However if the bacteria can form a biofilm it may take 5000X to kill the bacteria. Some long term chronic bacterial infections make biofilms. The biofilm itself may make penetration with antibiotics harder in itself with an added benefit of allowing protection from the immune system as well, not this is a general statement and there can be differences.\n\nMy perception of the situation is, again a general statement with nuance, that for that individual being treated and there is resistance that we don't see these modest changes in growth (should they exist) being such that it is a factor in overcoming the infection and for the most part, by itself, is not of great help in eradicating the infection. Again using the simple example above of a patient being treated with one drug with resistance development to be clear. Also important to note, changes observed in the lab dish if they exist, may not  reflect what is going on the the body or if it matters. A bit slower growth in a bacteria in a lab dish but instead forms a biofilm in the body could make it irrelevant for treatment purposes. Cystic Fibrosis patients have issues with biofilms making infection eradication more difficult and some treatments have been developed to disrupt the biofilm structure to allow for better antibiotic response. \n\nBiofilms are also a problem as some of the bacteria do not grow in the biofilm, persister cells, sort of like becoming dormant (alive but not replicating). Most antibiotics work against actively growing bacteria. When these persister cells stop growing antibiotics may not work in most cases. Most, but not all, antibiotics work against growing cells by blocking some function of the bacteria it needs to grow and reproduce. If a bacteria is not growing actively they will not work in many cases. With this you can get chronic bacterial infections that are hard or we are unable to treat depending.\n\nThis outlines some simpler situations to demonstrate generally what some of the issues are. Keep in mind we typically do not treat patients so simply. As I mentioned testing at the outset for resistance can allow the use of an antibiotic that does work, or use multiple antibiotics. And as others mentioned scientists are looking for ways to take advantage of the changes that occur in resistance to see if that can be used to some advantage with combinations or new treatments. So there is a lot of work going on with all of this because it is a big and growing issue. \n\nAt the present time, generally, we are not at a point of  reversing this. We do need new drugs but the economics of developing new antibiotics is really problematic and not many are being  made. Yes you will hear of one or two a year but this needs to be done at a larger scale and the issues are not so much technical as financial as most all drugs are developed by companies. This is not an issue of the evil pharma you hear so frequently on reddit. The issue is antibiotics cannot typically be made and turn a profit. A few start up companies did develop a new antibiotic, it worked, but due to the economics promptly went out of business. Efforts are being made with government and companies trying to figure a solution to this economic dilemma and previous efforts in this regard have not worked.", "label": 0}

{"text": "We're talking about bacteria, not animals. This is important for a few reasons; first of all, generation time is much shorter (so evolution is sped up, aside from the lack of sexual reproduction).

And finally, bacteria tend to be very optimized for growth and low energy consumption, so the small added cost of a single gene is proportionally much bigger.\n\nOverall, this means a gene with no (immediate) benefit will tend to be lost much faster in bacteria than animals. Especially if it's on a plasmid. You can pretty much lose that in one night of culturing bacteria.", "label": 0}

A lot of organisms can come up with some pretty elaborate adaptations to challenges of their environment. This takes many generations but obviously, bacteria go through those pretty quickly as well.\n\nI was thinking that at some point the bacteria that develops traits that are innocuous (or only have symptoms well after infection) will just be more successful and more likely to procreate. The bacteria that won't will elicit medical intervention and die out.\n\n> If the scenario you\u2019re describing worked, it would have already happened. \n\nIsn't that essentially what antibiotic resistance is though? That bacteria that couldn't survive died off and the only ones left are ones that have traits that make them more impervious to the classes of antibiotic we have?", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yeah, these are really good thoughts. My first answer was a little too black and white, now that I've thought about it a little more maybe I can give a more nuanced answer...sorry it's a bit long.\n\n> I was thinking that at some point the bacteria that develops traits that are innocuous (or only have symptoms well after infection) will just be more successful and more likely to procreate. The bacteria that won't elicit medical intervention and die out.\n\nThere's a couple points to be made here. First, you are actually correct in a broad sense--most bacteria are innocuous and live with us in a complementary way. For example, the gut microbiome is comprised of a ton of bacteria that help us and benefit from being there.\n\nIt's also important to note that most of the symptoms characteristic of an infection aren't from the bacteria, they're your immune system going crazy because they notice \"something doesn't belong here\", which isn't a trait that bacteria can change. For example, a big risk of bacteremia is sepsis, which is an overloaded immune response causing your body to damage your own organs. These aren't traits that a bacteria can typically change via evolution, since a lot of the things your immune system recognizes are either fundamental pieces of the bacterial lifecycle or broad patterns.\n\nThere is a point to be made about viruses, since they can't reproduce outside a host. In viruses we tend to see a tradeoff between virulence (how deadly the disease is) and how contagious/transmissible it is. Most diseases eventually become not super deadly over time, a topical and debatable example being COVID. However, with viruses we don't have any antibiotic resistance.\n\nNow if we specifically think about antibiotic-resistant pathogens--most antibiotic pathogens are also innocuous. One in three people have MRSA living on their skin or in their nose, with no ill effects. The most common place we see antibiotic-resistant infections are (1) people that are actively being treated with antibiotics, or (2) people that are somewhat immunocompromised.\n\nFor people actively being treated with antibiotics, the evolution is reactionary like I mentioned in my previous comment. These are pathogens that are already fighting your body for survival, and becoming resistant allows them to stick around longer.\n\nFor people that are immunocompromised, it's more that the bacteria that are already coexisting peacefully with you basically see an opportunity to \"cheat\", and become pathogenic (these are called opportunistic pathogens). In that scenario, they switched *from* peacefully coexisting *to* being dangerous. That switching is typically because it gives a local gain--the bacteria aren't really \"trying\" to cause an infection, they just want to grow (and usually then move somewhere they shouldn't).\n\nThe traits that separate \"good\" from \"bad\" bacteria is typically (1) following the rules and growing where they should (ecoli in your gut is fine, ecoli in your bloodstream is not) and (2) not producing any bad stuff while they grow (botulism is caused by a toxin produced by a bacterium). \"Not producing bad stuff\" is also typically difficult for organisms to change, because they can often be things that are critical to the cell lifecycle (e.g. LPS, which is a main component of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria). We just call them toxins because they're bad for us, not because they're made with malicious intent towards humans.\n\nHopefully that helps answer your question. The tl;dr is that yes, you're mostly correct, it's just not super simple to get the trait you're describing since a lot of it is driven by your immune system. \n\n> Isn't that essentially what antibiotic resistance is though? That bacteria that couldn't survive died off and the only ones left are ones that have traits that make them more impervious to the classes of antibiotics we have?\n\nYes, but that's only for individual infections in people and specific communities. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a threat to humans for sure, but in the larger scheme of all bacteria on the planet, they're not that common (at the level of resistance you'd find post-treatment in a hospital). We don't see MRSA being the most common phenotype of staph aureus, for example. Antibiotic resistant bacteria will also revert to lower levels of resistance if they're not constantly exposed to the antibiotic, so it's unlikely that human antibiotic use specifically is enough of a selective pressure over the short timespan we've been on the planet to make evolutionary forces push pathogenic bacteria towards adapting to be less dangerous to us (than they currently are). But I could definitely be wrong, we're unfortunately cursed with lives much shorter than evolutionary timescales.\n\n-----\n\nI'll also mention here that there is a pretty cool case that's exactly what you're describing regarding \"evolving to be innocuous\". Syphilis classically presents with little to no symptoms whatsoever. It's like the stealth bomber of the bacteria world, it settles in weird spots and has some unique cell characteristics that make your immune system just not see it. It eventually starts eating bone and causing you real issues (separate from immune response). \n\nIn the pre-antibiotic era a scientist figured out that syphilis is actually really easy for your immune system to handle, if it could only just see it! So they started [purposefully infecting people with malaria](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical-student-contributors-history/fighting-fire-fire-how-nobel-prize-winning-scientists-used-malaria-cure-syphilis#:~:text=One%20example%20is%20the%201927,caused%20by%20a%20bacterial%20infection.) to stimulate a severe immune response, waiting for that to take the syphilis out with it, and then giving antimalarials to remove the malaria. High risk of killing the patient and worse than antibiotics, but before penicillin it was better than nothing.", "label": 0}

Mainly that there's no architect or even directionality to evolution.  If a colony develops immunity to some antibiotic, its through genetic drift and selection, (and horizontal gene transfer, but not important here).  It would lose that immunity trait by the same method, genetic drift and selection.  It would not be like refunding or undoing a feature, but an evolutionary process based on selection. Thus, if no pressure exists to change the trait,  it would not go away until degradation and noise render it defunct.\n\nI have found people who are unsure about evolution often have a gamified perspective on traits, akin to equipment shops, so I wanted offer this context.", "label": 0}

Resistant bacteria have scissors to cut the yarn, but owning scissors doesn't make you a less fit person, and typically their resistance does also not negatively impact the bacteria.\n\nHowever there are approaches to make use of those scissors. A carrier package is equipped with an antibiotic that is tied to the package with yarn and the antibiotic is rendered inert this way. As soon as the package delivers the antibiotic into the bacterial cell, the bacteria cuts the yarn, releasing the antibiotic that is not made of yarn, killing itself in the process. The best part of this method? Our own beneficial bacteria do not own scissors, so rather than wiping out your own microbiome while trying to fight a disease, the are left untouched.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Part of the answer just reflects that by and large, where deposition happens (and thus sedimentary rocks form) is almost exclusively in locations that are *really* flat. This isn't by accident, in the simplest sense a vast majority of sedimentary rocks reflect sediment that was transported by water and the carrying capacity of water in terms of sediment scales with flow velocity which scales with slope. I.e., in the broadest sense, *very low* slopes (i.e., flat areas) implies relatively low flow velocities which in turn implies reduced carrying capacity which in turn implies deposition. If slopes are higher (and flow velocities are higher, and thus sediment carrying capacity is higher), broadly, there won't be much deposition (and instead there will be either erosion or at least \"sediment bypass\", i.e., the sediment just keeps moving even if no new sediment is added from erosion), and definitely not much deposition that sticks around long enough to make it into the rock record. \n\nAnother part of the answer is the timescale and rates. The weather vs climate distinction is kind of a reasonable analogy here. I.e., weather is the stochastic minute-to-minute to day-to-day variable set of conditions where as climate is the long-term average of all of that noise. For the most part, the rock record is reflecting a long-term average of higher order fluctuations so there isn't necessarily great preservation of individual events because even something like a few meter thick bed of a sedimentary rock can reflect *a lot* of time.\n\nThat being said, and while it's definitely correct to say that most (sedimentary) rock layers are originally flat and *mostly* reflect a kind of semi-steady average, there's some embedded flawed premises in that these don't reflect or record at least some of the processes you're asking about. Some (non-exhaustive) examples:\n\n* While we tend to think about a given stratigraphic layer reflecting a kind of slow-and-steady accumulation of material, there are clear examples of single layers that reflect single events/periods. Good examples are so-called \"event beds\" in the submarine realm which are often linked to individual storms (e.g., [Keen et al., 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2006GL027981)).\n* Similarly, in detail, many seemingly monotonous sequences of sedimentary rock may actually reflect a lot of individual events, specifically erosive events (e.g., [Trabucho-Alexandre, 2014](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/SP404.10)). Here, signs of processes like erosion are there, but are *extremely* subtle and hard to tease out.\n* There are any number of \"primary sedimentary structures\" in otherwise flat and continuous rock units that record various erosional and/or sedimentary transport processes, e.g., [cross-bedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding), [graded bedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_bedding), [ripples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_marks), fills of [paleochannels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeochannel), etc. These are all usually at smaller scales than the entire geometry of a given bed, but are nevertheless there and give us, at least intermittent records, of process.\n* While at sort of an intermediate scale (1-10s of kilometers), beds often seem pretty monotonous in terms of type of sediment and thickness and laterally continuous, at gross scales, there can be a lot of variability and there will always be [facies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facies) transitions as you move laterally within a unit, I.e., in a single sort of horizontal slice reflecting deposition at a particular time, you'd expect to find lateral transitions in the type of deposits reflecting different environments. You also expect that the layers (in terms of tracking the same \"facies\") will have a little bit of slope to them reflecting movement through time and space as the location of particular environments change and overlap each other, leading to patterns like [these](http://www.sepmstrata.org/CMS_Images/Accomodation-Modelling.gif) - note those the vertical scale on these are *highly* exaggerated to show the sloped geometries of some of those packages.", "label": 0}

{"text": "You don't!\n\n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, you can treat every model and every piece of knowledge in the entire universe as having a statistical likelihood based on the series of observations so far, and thus every prediction about the future based on these models will have confidence bounds. In other words, you can't factually say \"the sun will rise tomorrow\" with 100% confidence, but you can say it with 99.999999% confidence based on current models and observations.\n\n\nBut that still begs the question of why *models* and *hypotheses* and *knowledge* and so on are even a valid or useful way of looking at the universe, if they can never be completely proven to be true. There are really two answers to this question. First, our models (science, etc.) are useful in as much as they are *descriptive* and *predictive.* In other words, judge them by their utility, not by some abstract concept of absolute truth. Second, our brains are hardwired to look for patterns and repetitions, and to describe the world in terms of persistent concepts that repeat and follow a pattern. It's literally impossible for us to conceive of the world in any other way than attempting to describe it inductively.", "label": 0}
