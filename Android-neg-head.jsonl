End of 2022 is when the 3G CDMA networks on T-Mobile & Verizon were sunset.\n\nApple did use Intel modems on Verizon models in the iPhone 7 and 8 series, and they performed much worse than the Qualcomm equivalents. By the iPhone X, Apple was putting Intel modems in the AT&T and T-Mobile equivalents (all GSM), and Qualcomm modems in the Sprint & Verizon Variants (CDMA for 3G, LTE onward is all GSM) because their performance on CDMA was so bad.\n\niPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 series have all used Qualcomm modems because Intel/Apple have never shipped 5G capable modems and they need 5G support to be competitive in the modern smartphone market.", "label": 0}

The A18 pro is the best SoC in any phone, but android people tend to not buy iPhone and vice versa. S24 would be the closest competitor to a Pixel 9.

{"text": "Yeah it has had a negative impact, in terms of routing a lot of traffic through roads that you would never use if navigating using a paper map. In the city where I live (London, UK) traffic has doubled on unclassified roads (i.e. ones deemed not important enough to be part of the numbering system) since GPS apps became popular. But over the same period, traffic on other categories of road has barely changed at all.\n\nI suppose that's not necessarily on Google though. To them, roads are just data representing lines on a map, and they don't really differentiate one line from another. If local authorities don't think a road is suitable to take large volumes of through traffic, then there are ways to prevent that, e.g. traffic circulation plans (although these are rarely seen outside of urban areas).\n\nSome kind of \"keep to main roads\" option would be nice, but really unless the places you're driving through have done the legwork to try and keep through traffic to suitable roads, the only option as I see it is basically to keep an eye on your phone, and keep manually correcting the route when you see it's taking you on a detour to \"save time\".", "label": 0}

I have heard that Samsung isn't the greatest at photo processing though.\n\n\nI've never replaced the charging port or battery but at the moment a charge takes 5 to 6 hours, if the cable is bent the right way, and three times slower than that charging in a car. I could theoretically fix this DIY for less than $100 according to Google.\n\n\n\nI also used to play mobile games in the past but I haven't for a while now; I'm not sure if that's because I've changed or my phone has no storage space for huge modern mobile games which run up to 10-20+ gb each.

{"text": "I'll be surprised if the lens isn't designed and made by manufacturers like Largan in Taiwan, but I guess we'll never find out, I am also not sure Zeiss can contribute much software wise, Leica make more sense because they still make their own digital camera bodies.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Yeah and I think that's such a stupid idea for companies to take into consideration. I understand that they are trying to think of everyone who's the phone but for the most part from my experiences working for a phone provider, I can go ahead and tell you that about 99% of old people have absolutely no idea what half of those buttons will do \ud83d\ude02 And in the ones that do know what the buttons do, rarely ever touch them because they hate their phone changing because they'll just use it to and I quote \"I only need to send text and calls and that's all I need it for\" I hear it on a daily basis", "label": 0}

{"text": "To a point, yes. Lens design for tiny phone camera modules hasn't actually changed that much however. There's a reason Google keeps using a 4 year old samsung GN1 in their phones, and the IMX363 for every model before the 6. The pictures keep getting better, the Pixel routinely tops \"best phone camera\" charts, the sensor and lenses don't change.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Because all the others skimp on it so the competitors can too. All of these boxes outside of the Nvidia Shield TV and the Apple TV seem to made from terrible components that are all equally slow whether its because the processor sucks or they don't give it enough RAM. I kinda blame Roku and Amazon for making it normal for these slow set top boxes/sticks existing in the first place as they sold the most early on and shaped the expectations for these devices.", "label": 0}

{"text": "that battery patent is only available for use in china as of now, i dont think apple has access to it unless they order batteries from CATL", "label": 0}
{"text": "It was just an example to say you cannot do that cause there arent drivers compatible.  \nYou can actually force most W11 drivers to work on W10, but it is the same for W11 rolling back to W10, if a device has no compatible W10 drivers, you couldnt use it. Most legacy Android version would actually work fine on any device, but the issue would be indeed the lack of devices drivers. The same for custom roms, they need those drivers too.  \nAnother issue you would encounter is app compatibility, many apps dont work at all with older android version, even if the phone itself can run an older android version.", "label": 0}
