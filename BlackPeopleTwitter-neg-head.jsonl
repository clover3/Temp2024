{"text": "I wrote a super long comment lol, it's not meant to be adversarial, I just find this topic interesting and close to my heart.\n\nSo being trans myself, and having studied sociology, I am very much of the opinion that the psychological aspects of transition are severely understated by most people, even most trans people. \n\nYou do very much learn how to \"think like a man/woman\" throughout your transition. Not only because were held to different expectations (and often need to conform to those expectations strongly if we want to be taken seriously as our gender), but you just find yourself in different situations (a lot of trans women talk about how we miss going on walks alone now).\n\nThat said, I don't think I cry because I'm a woman, or because it's more acceptable to cry now that I am one. Back when I thought I was a boy, I never held back tears because I thought it would make me \"less of a man\"\u2014 rather, I would often literally wish for tears in that moment and they literally would not come. Now that I'm living as a woman, I will always opt for privacy if I need to cry, and try to hold back tears in some moments. They simply come easier than they used to, regardless of my wishes, there.\n\nAlso note that I said trans women cite that as an effect of *estrogen* specifically. Emotional changes are one of the most immediate reported changes in hormone therapy. Many trans women start our medical transitions before our social transitions (known as \"boymoding\"), and experience these effects before anybody else treats us as women. I've really never heard an account of a trans woman needing to spend a lot of time socially transitioning and considering herself a woman before letting herself cry. Conversely, many trans women socially transition first, and medically transition a few years in (often because of medical gatekeeping policies requiring \"real life experience\"). They may be subject to the extreme standards of femininity more than other trans women, but still report crying shortly upon taking estrogen.\n\nI think that yes, there are multiple factors that predispose someone to crying. Social factors matter, levels of stress and I could see genetics playing a role, too. I also don't think that Testosterone's suppression effect necessarily has a \"100% no tears level,\" just that it makes things different, but that they on average make it more difficult to cry.", "label": 0}

His grandmother worked at the Vietti chilli factory in our city for decades and she was SUPER serious about food safety. \n\nOf course this isn't just a race thing but I always wondered why my other friends (not Chris or Brandon) would let the dogs and cats in the kitchen. We had a dog and my sister would lose her crap every time he went near the kitchen. \n\nI never cooked (other than a sandwich or ramen) so I just assumed it was because he was going to try to beg for scraps or get into thengarbage.

Agree with that or not, it's a viewpoint that paints one side as the \"obviously\" evil side, yet if you make it about it being woman's health or rights to her own body, the narrative shifts.  Most people exist in the middle:  immigration good, unlimited illegal immigration bad.  Taxing the rich good, taxing the middle class bad.  That sort of thing.

{"text": "The problem with the abortion is murder lie is that they want abortion banned even if the fetus is already dead. How does killing the woman by refusing her an abortion of an already dead fetus save a baby? It doesn't, but it does punish the women. \n\n\nAlso\n\n\nhttps://joycearthur.com/abortion/the-only-moral-abortion-is-my-abortion/?origin=serp_auto\n\n\nA lot of these \"you're killing babies\" people seem to have no problem getting one when it's themselves. \n\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of easy to spot lie I was talking about. You are still falling for it. Try actually looking into the ACTIONS, not words of each side. Try to see if the actions match the words. Stop just believing what they tell you. \n\n\nHell, even just looking up voting records will show how frequently and how blatantly one side lies. Challenge yourself to learn something and break free from the both sides BS. \n\n\n\nAlso, look up the paradox of tolerance. \n\n\n\n I hope you take some of this to heart. I used to be the same way, trying to see the good in everyone. But some people don't have any good in them, it's grim and depressing, but it's true. \n\n\n\nGood luck.", "label": 0}
{"text": "As a fellow WW, wholeheartedly agree. I'll admit, though, the first time I saw this video, I was here for it because I was thinking about how I felt the same way in the last general election, dancing in my head the whole way to the drop box when I dropped my and my mother's ballots off because at least my vote canceled out my mother's Trump and R votes. I took great pleasure when she complained that she felt like her vote didn't matter in our blue state because of the electoral college, and she actually canceled her voter registration afterward voluntarily. I'd rather see eligible people exercise their right to vote, but it was also fine by me, one less R vote to worry about in our district that unfortunately leans red.\n\nBut, thinking about it, I don't know whether to feel bad for this woman or not because from this video alone, we don't know what her husband was like or believed before the Trump infection took hold. We all know that MAGA has emboldened a lot of people to be loud and proud with their hateful views, much to the surprise and dismay of loved ones in many cases. If he already held shitty views that she knew about when she married him, despite how opposed it was to her own views, then shame on her for marrying this garbage human. If this is new from him, girl, why are you still with him? If I were married and my spouse turned far right,  Trumper, or manosphere on me, I'd *happily* file for divorce so fast that there'd be burning tire marks all the way from my house to the courthouse.\n\nWhenever possible, I refuse to abide people in my life whose views and morals are so vile and reprehensible. I think all of us, especially WW, have a responsibility to not marry or procreate with these garbage men. And you're so right we WW have the numbers and potential to enact such incredible positive change and progress, but so many vote against our own interests and against those of minorities and other marginalized people. It's like a few years of progress let modern WW forget that we're also a historically marginalized class and that the men, especially WM, would happily strip them of all the rights they currently still enjoy at the first opportunity. It's so frustrating that they're this short-sighted, on top of being just so full of hate that they don't care who it hurts as long as they believe it hurts the *right people right now*. Ugh.", "label": 0}
