{"text": ">Men commit most violent/irrational crimes. (Not saying that most men are criminals, obviously, but the majority of criminals are men.) How many female mass shooters/serial killers are there?\n\nWhile I agree that men are more likely to act-out violently, I don't think that's the full picture if we're talking about being emotional. I think a lot of female antisocial behavior goes under the radar because it's relational aggression - like gossip, ostracizing, emotional games, character assassination, and lies. I've heard some stories about groups of women who suddenly ostracize one of their members. For example, I've heard stories about women in high school who's entire group of female friends just stopped talking to her one day. Or another one where a woman in college got kicked out of her sorority. Neither of them knew why. Just seemed like \"mean girl\" kind of stuff. Personally, I've seen quite a few cases of women suddenly ostracizing their best friend.\n\nI've generally found women to be more prone to unpredictable changes in mood. For example, a few years ago I had a friend I'd occasionally hang-out with. At one point, she just stopped returning any of my text messages when I asked about meeting up. \n\n>Men are usually the ones who start wars for (seemingly) stupid reasons. Most war crimes/atrocities and genocides in history were committed by men. Hitler and Stalin were pretty emotional/irrational. (The vast majority of world leaders have been men, to be fair.)\n\nThere was some historians who went back and looked at wars. What they found was that female leaders (i.e. a Queen when there was no King) was more likely to start wars than kings were. He wondered if maybe these female leaders were seen as weak, and attacked by other kingdoms more, but that wasn't the case. It appears that female leaders actually start more wars than men. Probably the reason we rarely see wars and genocides by women is because female leaders are rare, not because female leaders are peaceful. Here's an article about it: \n\n>After sifting through historical data on queenly reigns across six centuries, two political scientists have found that it\u2019s more complicated than that. In a recent working paper, New York University scholars Oeindrila Dube and S.P. Harish analyzed 28 European queenly reigns from 1480 to 1913 and found a 27 percent increase in wars when a queen was in power, as compared to the reign of a king. \u201cPeople have this preconceived idea that states that are led by women engage in less conflict,\u201d Dube told Pacific Standard, but her analysis of the data on European queens suggests another story.

With wealth inequality at an all time high, and women (low income POC women especially) still shouldering the majority of the unpaid and undervalued child rearing duties and other labor in the domestic sphere, you cannot be surprised when upwards socioeconomic mobility becomes a huge motivator for low income POC women to seek out wealthier men.\n\nWhy is them wanting money seen as better than a guy dating a woman he thinks is attractive?\n\n>Exactly. For the most part, this is true. So if financial practicality is removed for those POC men to have plausible deniability in that they don\u2019t have racist dating preferences, doesn\u2019t it make lot more sense why women give each other more benefit of doubt in their interracial relationships?\n\nNo. It is just attraction. Wanting someone for financial reasons should be the one that is seen as weird. One is genuine and the other isnt. They gain nothing and still date them. And I doubt finances are the main reason for women. They just find those men more attractive. \n\n>Not because I believe that women are somehow magically less capable of racism than men are, but because there are strong socioeconomic reasons for POC women to seek out wealthier (white) men, especially as wealth inequality everywhere gets worse. And sure this also grants plenty of women plausible deniability in their secret racist preferences, but the fact still stands.\n\nWhy is that acceptable? Like I said before most people end up with those on their same economic level. So the women most likely will not end up with her idealized version of a rich white man. He will be in her income range.

CPS is not taking your child away from you because you refused to donate your own organ to them.\n\n>What if the condition is genetic? They absolutely caused that. \n\nNah, I wouldn't place the blame of that on the parents. We don't control our genetics or how they're inherited, and blaming people for creating children with genetic conditions is kind of a wild take. Especially because not everyone even has access to genetic screening or education of how genetics work.\n\n>Again, it\u2019s absolutely a manufactured consequence because we have the safe means to end pregnancies. Banning it is manufactured. There is no getting around that so you may as well just admit it.\n\nBy your logic:\n\n-Murdering the homelessness is an easy way to end homelessness\n-Therefore if you don't support murdering homeless people, you support the \"manufactured\" problem of homelessness existing.\n\nThat analogy may not hold up in your mind because you don't see a fetus as a living thing that deserves rights (like homeless people are). The analogy absolutely holds up in the mind of pro-life people.\n\n>No, I don\u2019t think YOU know what responsibility means because the concept of responsibility doesn\u2019t render abortion unjustified at all. Feel free to explain to me why you think otherwise though?\n\n-the fetus is a person therefore it is entitled to life and protection of that life\n-it's reasonable to hold the mother personally responsible for the fetus's life because she willingly engaged in the act that she knew could create it\n-taking responsibility for the life in this case is carrying it to term, therefore this is what the mother should do.\n\nThere's a pretty obvious and logical flow between those concepts, regardless of whether or not you're capable of comprehending it.", "label": 0}

But really it\u2019s just ultimately important to them, so they dig deeper, but really it\u2019s just their feels, not really an attachment to reality.\n\nThe issue is that this thinking becomes terminally disruptive, I think the only thing I\u2019ve seen that compares is like when racists complain about the Jews, it\u2019s that kind of idee fixe. And this also ruins communities.\n\nI mean sure, you can say looks matter, everything matters, and it is almost entirely uninteresting that this is the case. It doesn\u2019t even really need to be brought up, red pill and blue pill both did not discuss looks for a decade because they both agreed some manner of looks is important.

Your \"badly behaved\" woman might be my ideal partner for all you know. By encouraging all women to fit into the box of you're preferences, your forgetting about everyone who prefers things in other ways, and trying to encourage people to hide who they are and how they really want to behave.\n\nAll standards are subjective and based on personal preferences and taste. It's not someone's job to fit yours, it's your job to find or wait for someone who fits them. If someone asks why you're not into them, go ahead, but if no one is asking for your opinion on how they should be, just shut the fuck up and live your own life.

Why waste time dating someone and getting attached if you are just going to have to break up in the end? The sooner you find the reason to end it the easier ending it is.\n\nMost marriages are between 2 people who both work and it is financially beneficial to both parties. It's hard as hell to afford more than just your bills when you are living on your own these days. Married people split bills and afford more. They not only have more assets but they also have more assets that earn money like home equity. When a marriage splits up both parties walk away with assets. Married people also tend to earn more which is a benefit. \n\nIf you are concerned about supposedly losing money in the case of a divorce marry someone who earns somewhere in the general ballpark of what you do. Alimony is only paid out in 10 percent of divorces and almost exclusively where one spouse doesn't work at all or works significantly less. Just don't marry someone who doesn't work. Considering that is less and less common every year it shouldn't be all that hard. \n\nI just don't understand why more men don't give a fuck about the finances of people they date or marry. Marriage requires more than just love, love doesn't pay the bills, love doesn't get you through hart times, love doesn't feed the kids.", "label": 0}

Hookup culture has influenced the ways in which people commit to dates/relationships and I think that it is necessary to make sure both parties are on the same page. When I was dating, that was something that I brought up fairly soon because I was worried about putting energy into a relationship that was just headed toward a dead end.\n\nAlso, historically marriage has been an economic prospect for a woman, as it was essential to survival. These days, I would argue that being a stay at home father is more common than it used to be and that women are becoming (statistically) much more financially independent.

In contrast, just 15% of previously married women want to remarry, and 27% are not sure; about half of these women (54%) report that they do not want to remarry.\n\nSo either men are stupid, or your premise is false", "label": 0}
