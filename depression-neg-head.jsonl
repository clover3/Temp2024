The unfairness is the worst of it. As you say, some people just avoid trouble whereas it seems to follow me (at least). I feel like my life has been a shield to my sister. My gravity has sucked in all the bad debris while her life glides along.

Is that part of why you\u2019re in a hole mentally now? (Fully understandable). Having a project to work on has helped focus my mind and get me off the treadmill of negativity for a while. \n\nSometimes though, it\u2019s especially bad, like it sounds with you now. Honestly, all I can do is weather the storm. I\u2019ve had all-nighters where my mind is spinning. I just have to sit in the pain and wait it out.

The absurdity of life that people suffer so profoundly. \n\nAre you on good speaking terms with your ex?

{"text": "I remember hearing a classmate tell us that after her fiance died she fell into a dark place. She made a conscious decision to get outside and walk. Every day. Every day she would force herself to get outside and walk no matter if it was raining, snowy, freezing cold, and she took her camera to look for something to take a picture of every day. This slowly healed her. I always remember that story. Forcing yourself to get up and get out is a huge feat, but I wonder how much we'd all start to heal if we got outside and looked for the beauty of the gift of creation. I don't think healing and happiness comes from society's definition of success. We can have everything and be miserable.

{"text": "The only way to 'fix' social anxiety is to interact with people which is why social anxiety is so hard to deal with. There is no easy fix to loneliness with social anxiety, you just have to try to work on it through interacting with people. Gradual exposure is a good start, try putting yourself in situations that give you a little anxiety and have little consequence (for example saying hi to a cashier) and work your way up in small increments, the only way this will ever be solved is through interaction. I know from personal experience how hard social anxiety is to deal with but the only solution to your problem is to gradually face your anxiety. You just have to try, which is easier said than done, but will leave you with less regret.", "label": 0}

It\u2019s like something is watching me.I tend to stay up aswell alot. Like I went a day without sleep because I had so much energy. Everything feels so good Music, earth looks beautiful, etc. I start telling my family how much I love and care for them and even talking to old coworkers and stuff. I do not do this shit usually . .\n\nAfter this comes the crash. It\u2019s worse than my usual depression. I get really anxious, suicidal , and agitated easily. This is typically in the past where i would cope with a substance to get back that amazing feeling . I\u2019m clean now but in this stage I get a morbid curiosity of recreational drugs , Death, and criminal behavior.In this stage I crave adrenaline. I have got into physical altercations, I go extreme speeds in neighborhoods , I spend money and act impulsively. 50K in a short amount of time . I noticed this stuff when I started reflecting. I can\u2019t name how much time, energy, and effort that I feel wasted and after three years of the same cycle\n\nThe worse thing is that I have a self defense mechanism from my childhood trauma and bullying that almost unwillingly makes me always say I\u2019m fine. My Brain always seems to \u201cresolve\u201d the issue but in reality it\u2019s me hiding from myself if that makes sense. I go to therapy and say I\u2019m fine . The night before I was debating about killing myself. The week before I stayed in bed for a month rotting away. If you know what I\u2019m saying. I want it to stop. I\u2019ve convinced alot of my therapists and wasted time because they always say the same thing and it\u2019s because my brain won\u2019t allow me to show emotion in fear of judgement . They always say I\u2019m well dressed, mannered , and professional because they have only saw that side. It\u2019s like manipulation at the point but my I\u2019m the one being manipulated to tell them I\u2019m ok. I get scared that if I saw what i really feel that something bad will happen to me.I start saying I\u2019m happy on the screenings and behavior test but if you compare them it\u2019s never consistent how can you go from being extremely happy to extremely suicidal in a term of hours.\n\nThis is my life.

{"text": "If you're tired, then rest.\n\nAbout relationships, largely there are 2 kinds. Transactional and emotional. You seem to have been only in transactional one's so far and that is unsurprising. The vast majority or relationships today are transactional it seems. If an emotional one happens to you, you will have a different experience.\n\nAbout getting somewhere, life has 2 dimensions.\n\nThe first is survival, you have to survive to live. When it comes to this dimension, \"getting somewhere\" is applicable. This is a logical dimension, it has steps, it has degrees, progression is possible. This is like school, you progress from grade to grade. Or like science, you need to make the basic discoveries first, then you make the more complex one's. There's clear progress, you're \"getting somewhere\".\n\nThe second is life itself. You've secured your survival, your existence, now it's time to exist! Most people don't reach this dimension, they stop at survival and remain there for their entire lives. That is why they never become happy, because they never live, just survive.\n\nIn this dimension, there's no progress, because this is not a logical dimension. If we have to make a supposition since I mentioned logic previously, this is the dimension of emotion. Emotion is sudden, it can just happen at any time, no steps, no progress, just BOOM and it's there.\n\nIf survival is science, then life is music, art. The goal in music is not to play the fastest song, it is not to reach the end of the song the quickest, or to compose the song the quickest. The goal is the song itself and there is nothing beyond that. In dance, the goal is to dance, there's nothing beyond that. You're not looking for the fastest dancer, you're not looking to end the dance at a particular spot on the floor, that is irrelevant. The dance is all there is, the dance is everything and there is nothing beyond it. It serves no purpose and it has no conclusion or criteria.\n\nThe same goes for love, there's no goal beyond it, there's no progression in it. You either love or you do not love. if you're in love, then there's no progression and no goal beyond love, you just love! And there's no need for a goal or something beyond, just being in it is a great bliss. No need to do anything or go anywhere, just being in it is all there is.", "label": 0}

But there is causality.\n\n\nI see happiness as the brain rewarding me for good self care.\n\n\nSociety pretends that happiness is to work 100h a week, with not enough pay to rent a home but have a house anyway, that you are lazy for sleeping at all, should go to the gym to run a marathon daily, have an erection on command, only need to drink coffee not eat.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not really exagerating. You don't even get a paycheck as a reward. You get a heart attack. Why would the brain give you happy juices when you're being burned to death by abusers, starved, sleep deprived, and literally poisonned.\n\n\nBecause you're a productive slave? Your body doesn't care. What's the point of being rich if you have no time to eat! What's the point of having a huge house if you're never in it and don't get to sleep.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that famous setotonin. It's not even made by the brain! It's made in the gut, with magnesium! How do you expect to make it by drinking stimulant coffee and pouson boze!? You don't! It's basic biology. Psychiatry knows nothing.\n\n\nLack of magnesium also makes you feel lonely & suicidal.\u00a0\n\n\nI saw lonely people pushing away people offering friendship. They ask, then reject the courage it took others to open up, because they want the closeness without opening the door.\n\n\nSo you either sabotage yourself... or you get rejected by people who find you incompatible... Like an obese guy wanting an athletic girl but who'd be miserable sharing her lifestyle... or rejected by people who prefer to look down on others than have an equal, an ally, a friend. And the gov divide us to conquer us.\n\n\nI'm not going to give people toxic positivity platitudes... I can't... The mods will probably ban me soon... I'm surprised & grateful they didn't yet. I'm like a wounded animal growling at everything... Hopefully some words will help you somewhere in all my spite...\n\n\nI think I understand yours...\n\n\nWhat did i do to be hit by a car and denied medical care, when even pedophiles out of jail don't get treated this way... Or denied to go in public like i was because i was too sick to risk getting virus injections... People turned on each other... Watched people be ostracized with glee... It was like the black ostracisation, like how they denounced jews to the nazis.\n\n\nPEOPLE ARE MONSTERS!!! THIS WORLD IS A PRISON!!! WE ARE SLAVES!!! STARVED AND POISONNED!!!\n\n\nwhy do people expect to be happy and not lonely when they accept to turn on each other and even against their own needs... To please their abusers.\n\n\nIt's not a handful of psychopaths who made this planet hell, it's the people surrendering their lives thinking it makes them kings, when it makes them slaves.\n\n\nHumanity doesn't even deserve to evolve from a monkey thurd.\n\n\nI bless any dust of not-pain and any interractions that isn't abuse.\n\n\nI think we shackled ourselves too much, hoping to control our workd like gods. Removing nutrition from processed food. Paying to breathe toxic air with a stick... Making it impossible to be self sufficient in a farm. Our appartments are cages piled up on top of each other like we do to chickens. Overpopulating because all lives are precious? No. Just doctors wanting success statistics and forcing unviable babies to suffer decades of agony...\u00a0\n\n\nWhy... After people denied me the right to exist anywhere... To feel... To think... Why should I be happy. Why should I trust again. It's unthinkable for me. Even if I recieved it, I would reject it as a lie, as a bait to abuse me...\n\n\nA closed heart cannot feel his lover's love. Only his own.\u00a0\n\n\nLove is just the urge to reproduce. I'd rather die.\n\n\nIt's not about being worthy. It's about reaching out for it... Opening up to welcome it... And pray the person isn't a lying asshole .", "label": 0}

It sounds like, contrary to most of your post, you DON'T want to die.\n\nIt does sound like you want your home life to change. This is still good news because that WILL change. For instance, at some point you will move away from your family. Even if you can't go full no-contact, being in a new environment could make a huge change in how you view your life.\n\nI'm sorry that you're having a crisis of faith. I don't know your particular religion, but not knowing whether or not God is real is part of religion. It's why we call it faith, it's believing in something you don't know is true. If everyone knew for a fact that God was real, everyone would behave VERY differently. So, wondering if God is real or not doesn't make you a bad person.\n\nYou're a kid and you're still learning about the world and how things work. You're bound to make mistakes and that's OK. It's normal, everyone makes mistakes. The hard part is regulating your emotions (I'm an adult and I still struggle with it myself). Things do get better as you get older since you have more control of your life and can seek help without permission.\n\nI know you're a teenager, so it's hard to fix any of your situation by yourself. For now, talking about how you feel probably is the best option. Writing in a journal could be helpful to express yourself in a healthy way. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is by making a list of things you like or make you happy. Start with 1 item and then add 1 more every day. Maybe start with your cat or a family member, or a friend and then keep working on adding things. \n\nAdditionally, you can start making a plan. For instance, \"I want to move out when I'm 18.\" Then you can go from there and say, \"I want to live in X country/state/province/city.\" Setting goals and then checking them off can be very helpful. You can list where you want to work in the future. Maybe you want to become a pilot? Maybe you want to go to space? Take some time to think about what's important to you. If you can't pick one thing, that's fine pick several. If you had unlimited money, what would you do with it? I hope this helps and sorry for the long post.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Your post hits hard, I\u2019m a similar age to you and struggling in college. Right now I\u2019m 2 weeks behind in my most important subject with an exam next week and I\u2019m probably going to get no sleep soon, again. It\u2019s a very vicious cycle. I also have panic attacks and this stress is ruining mental and physical health. From online binging I\u2019ve found some good tips, but take them with a grain of salt since it\u2019s coming from me.\n\nI think the best approach to this type of anxious behavior is to approach self-improvement from the lens of self-compassion and care. I know it sounds generic but at least from my experience, I always criticize and beat myself up everyday for my actions. I act like a drill instructor to myself, I self-flagellate and pressure myself to get good habits. I verbally and physically abuse myself everyday. Then I asked, why am I doing this to myself? Even if I am really pathetic and inept, why do I keep kicking a dead horse? \n\nI know it\u2019s hard because a lot of depression and anxiety comes from some form of self-hatred, so I think one of the first steps is to change that mental dialogue. \n\nAnd to be clear, self-care is not the same as putting important things off to self-soothe with the internet or whatever. In fact, I think we develop a lot of feel-good behaviors that are actually indirect self-harm and self-sabotage. It\u2019s more akin to a smoker quitting cigarettes, even if the cigarettes feel good. That is true self-compassion for your body and mind. If I\u2019m feeling really bad on a particular day I like to take a shower and make some hot tea to get back to reality a little bit, and go from there. \n\nI think the goal is to develop our inner thoughts as an inner \u201cfriend,\u201d something that provides compassion and accountability. I hope your situation gets better man. Idk if this helped at all and it might not solve everything, but know you\u2019re not alone in this brother.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Before living with my father and his family I was living with my mother and stepfather before that. My stepfather was being verbally and physically abusive for 4-5 years with him which felt like a lifetime.. His name is Richard but I\u2019ll refer to him as dick as the names are linked anyways. I guess the first year was the honeymoon phase for my mother but I never really liked him and knew something was off about him as a kid. Kids can figure out things more than adults realize.. \n\nMom was courting my 2nd soon to be step father dick behind my other step father Rick. As Rick was out of town for something possibly work or drug related. As he grew pot downstairs. Rick did treat me right though for the most part doing things together throwing a baseball or frisbee around.. there was one drug related night that kinda changed it all for me though that I won\u2019t go into here. And my mother years later was keeping in contact with him and handed me the phone one day after she knew what happened. It was like a way to mentally abuse me with a random out of the blue phone call I couldn\u2019t say anything to him worth talking about.\n\nWe actually came from a drug background of pot and cocaine with a different man in her life before that. My mother was seeing a guy named Ken who convinced her to bring me to live in Southern Mexico with him about 3-400 miles from Guatemala. Living there my mother is in a picture straight out of the movie Blow walking around a swimming pool in a bikini with 2 50gallon clear trash bags in each hand jammed full of pot with sunglasses on and a huge smile. We lived in Southern Mexico for 2-3 years with Ken. During that time from the time my mother and I arrived we went from the airport to some cracked out hole of an apartment. Idk if it was even 150sf with cockroaches the size of huge pieces of bark outside our apartment. To a giant spiders jumping from one wall to another and my mother using a whole can of Raid to kill it. Within a few months of moving there we moved into a massive mansion with workers to cook meals and do lawn care with a wall around the whole place. It was pretty obvious they were in deep with drug related activities looking back on it. I was a lot younger then so I didn\u2019t really think too much into it then as a small kid. They would have me help pick the seeds out of the harvested 5 foot buds for fun and I didn\u2019t think anything was weird about it. Anyways after we came back to the Us without Ken because the story was my mother found out he was sleeping with a maid. But I don\u2019t know if it was for safety reasons or maybe both. I never saw Ken that much and have little memories of him.\n\nTo be continued 2", "label": 0}
{"text": "The first step father Rick actually treated me like a son and he had 2 daughters of his own my step sisters. They flew us all to Florida from different states to spend a summer as kids with his parents.. my new grandparents they were very older sweet and church going. My sisters and I would get all ready for it on Sundays. We went together all the major theme park attractions there my step granddad showed me how to macram\u00e9 things.. We went to an Airforce base where they sold things cheaper than an average store and he bought me a nice Rawlings baseball mitt and went crabbing in the Florida Everglades.. so it was one of the best 3 months being with new step sisters I never had before that and having new grandparents as a kid. \n\nAnyways after those amazing times things went downhill. My mom left the guy for dick. So my 2nd step father was soon eventually mentally abusing me and my mother as well as physically abusing her which happened in front of me multiple times. So spent my preteen and teen years being their house cleaning slave from about grade 5 through 10th. I can\u2019t put age into it as they were not great memories. I\u2019m sure I could but I don\u2019t want to as this is very hard to even post. He would take his finger to the back of a bookshelf to see if I dusted it right for him weekly. Scrubbing their shower and toilet spotless a minimum of once per week but 2x was the plan to keep up on it..  doing dishes every night garbage and laundry daily. Laying and smoothing out the wrinkles out of his damp t-shirts on the couch coming out of the wash he didn\u2019t want in the dryer. If I did something wrong there would be couch sessions of mental abuse. Car rides were me silent staring out the window wondering if there was a better life than that. I never did it but there was a time I opened the passenger door of my step father\u2019s truck at a stop in the left lane with traffic and closed it. May have been subconsciously thinking of ending it. Another time I thought about jumping over the top of my mother in an abusive struggle on the floor to get to the front door and just run away to live on the street to get away from them. They were completely in the way so I didn\u2019t do it and had to watch my mother get beaten.\n\nThere was a brutal time he threw my mother down a flight of about 40 hard stairs in our art gallery they purchased as a business. It sounds glamorous it wasn\u2019t.. I mean even I knew then as a kid who needs to buy wildlife art and bronzes everyday? I only heard about later in life through my mother\u2019s sister my aunt that she almost left him that time.. My stepfather learned I was trying to leave and live with my real father he added in the physical before I left. My real father drove across our state and picked me up out of that situation with the double edged pain of wondering why he never contacted me for a decade. My mother saying he hardly or never paid $200 child support per month to her but he still came even having his own family at the time.\n\nTo be continued 3", "label": 0}

{"text": "Anyways.. My oldest half sister that\u2019s still alive was disowned our real dad early on for taking some fairly new bedroom furniture out of his house when she was living with him. But it happened ages ago. The furniture was in a guest bedroom so it wasn\u2019t like she took the bed he was sleeping on that night. Also I never knew if there may of been some conversation between them way before it even happened. Like suggesting she could have the furniture someday when she got a place of her own. She was just out of high school at the time. Barely getting out on her own with her girlfriend young roommates when she did it. Dad called the Sheriff on her to try to get the furniture back and press charges. I don\u2019t know for sure if he ever followed through with either of the two because it was so long ago and he never discusses it. She moved out of the area to start her life back then after that happened. Dad still did not want anything to do with her. He took all her pictures out of a family photo frame collage on the wall and left empty brown cardboard spaces. Everytime visiting him was the gut wrenching sadness to see that hanging on the dining room wall every time I went to visit him. \n\nOccasionally would bring up we really should all four try at least to be together as a family even if it was just on Thanksgiving or Christmas. Eggshells conversation every time. He would just get so angry we couldn\u2019t talk about it without regretting coming to see him. Trying to get him to see how his stupid his grudge was with his oldest daughter was destroying any possibility of knowing each other together as a family. Letting years tick by from kids to adults with our lives and people getting married and kids being born.. A stupid grudge over bedroom furniture for whatever reason he never let it go. \n\nEventually I had to stop seeing him for my own mental health. I think it was about 2017 since I\u2019ve last seen him. He would bring up anger about other general things in life and it started  to be a negative hit just trying to spend time with him. He wasn\u2019t all bad but the negativity side I couldn\u2019t handle just trying to see how he was and especially directed towards my older sister just trying to discuss the possibility of time together when it happened so long ago.\n\nHe eventually had to see my older of the two sisters his daughter at the celebration of life which as stated I didnt even know about it.. My dad, cousins family never said a word about it was happening to me and clearly could have send a social media message of they at least need me to contact them it\u2019s important and urgent. It was filmed by the funeral services thankfully and was able to watch it on my iPad about a month and a half after it happened. In the video he walked up behind to talk to my sister he had grudge with after it was over and the situation was really difficult for her. Could tell she was really uncomfortable from her body language. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t comfortable for him as well. As he was walking up to her with her high school aged son and burly looking husband sitting near her. She was shaking her hands out to the sides after about 4-5 minutes of conversation when it was over breaking a sigh of relief as he was walking away. He walked over around the mic podium and right past his grandson. Which he is around 14-15 losing his mother.. But not being at the celebration of life they may have done communicated before the video started. The man that killed his mother was not his father btw.\n\nTo be continued 4", "label": 0}

Or they may push you away. \n\nMeanwhile, your sister formed a trauma bond with the place where she stayed, as it became intertwined with the memory of losing her sibling.

Thoughts like \" why, why, why I wanted to live in that apt?! \" place would automatically repeats in her mind  nonstop for about a year.

{"text": "I\u2019m on the other end of this and can tell you how it can feel for us. When we love you, we want to do anything we can to support you but just don\u2019t know how to help. Seriously we\u2019re clueless unless we also have depression. And it hurts us when you don\u2019t respond IF we\u2019re unaware of how isolating works. But when we understand, then it doesn\u2019t hurt us. It took me a lot of research and Reddit and Quora threads on this exact subject to finally get it enough to be a good support. My tips for you are:\n\n1. Just let them know it\u2019s normal for depression to cause the need to isolate and it\u2019s nothing personal to them. You\u2019re not mad at them. It really helped me when I learned how even texting just one text can feel overwhelming. Tell them this.\n2. If you can, try to let them know when they\u2019re texting too much or if you\u2019re appreciating the amount their giving. We get so worried that we\u2019re smothering you or not checking in enough so it\u2019s a huge relief if you tell us what you like. Be honest. If you like daily contact, weekly, monthly, etc, or none at all, let them know.  We WANT to give you what you want and need.\n\nIf you\u2019re the friend of a depressed person, read as many threads on Quora and Reddit as you can. It\u2019s your responsibility to familiarize yourself with depression as much as possible because they just don\u2019t have the energy to teach you. From everything I read most depressed people love when you check in on them often and want you to know they probably won\u2019t respond but they\u2019ll appreciate you anyway even if they can\u2019t show it. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that it changes from day to day too. They may have a good day and actually be chatty or even want to see you (something low-key like taking a walk) and other days they will just stare at their phone listening to your texts or calls come through but not able to move. They will usually read or listen to them later though but probably won\u2019t respond because it could be days later.  I will often leave a voice message so they can listen to it back over and over again whereas texts can end up being too far up to scroll back.\n\nAnother good thing is to send a short video clip telling them a story about your day or just saying hi.

They literally can have a hard time just thinking. And don\u2019t expect them to make decisions. Avoid asking questions if you can. Just let them know you care and you\u2019re there for them if they need anything. \n\nAnd let them know how much you care and what you love about them. Depression tells them they\u2019re unworthy of love and that they\u2019re bad. Counter that by telling them if you think they are sweet soul or loving person or whatever is true for you.

I had some unfortunate events happen to me in my childhood and freshman year of college, so the trauma took over and I wrecked my 20's, lived in fear in my teens, and early onset of depression was my childhood. My whole past is full of regret but I'm learning that I got an opportunity (and thank God I took it) to address my life, who I am, what happened to me, and move forward .\u00a0\n\n\nThat means I get a chance to become a grounded human in my late 20's, giving me the rest of my life to fill with amazing experiences I used to be incapable of enjoying. So I feel you missing out on your early 20's but honestly, most people do. Most people go away to college, drink them selves silly, make bad decisions, sleep with people, destroy their self-esteem, and pretend that is normal! It's not! And it's not as fun as people make it seem. For some, of course, but everyone struggles. Honestly, everyone struggles HARD!!! Some in their early life, some in their middle life, some late in life, and those who choose not to change, well... Then the rest of their life.\u00a0\n\n\nYou got this!!! Just one day at a time.

You lost someone you gave a lot of love and warmth to, showcasing that you're capable of giving it, and so you need to find people who will appreciate and value that. \n\nWhile you care deeply about this person, she's still just one person, she doesn't define your worth. There are many people out there, it's possible to meet someone who will care and understand you fully for who you are. Still, I strongly encourage you to focus on yourself for now.

Whether it was the media, other people, family, anything. And feeling like an outcast can sap your motivation real quick. What's the point of doing anything when you feel so different? \n\nBut you're not weird. You should be accepted fully and unconditionally as your authentic self. Every human deserves that. Our anger, our joys, our interests, our passions... someone should unconditionally accept us (but not totally take our bullshit) for who we are. \n\nKeep looking for kin spirits. You'll find 100 people who don't fit your vibe, but that 101st one just might. It takes time to find people you feel that spark with. \n\nThere a shit ton of people in the world. There's got to be a group out there for you to match your weirdness. \n\nSource: I'm crazy as hell.", "label": 0}
