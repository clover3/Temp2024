This is most likely a guy who just happens to own a heavily scratched truck with a headache rack. I personally know half a dozen people who have such vehicles.

{"text": "I can think of lots of things that \"can and have been done\", doesn't mean it's the best way to do it or the most logical way to do it. The fact you suggest bed extenders is just laughable.\n\nFirst off, a moving van is *absolutely* the first choice if you are moving things. An enclosed space means no chance of your load falling off and no damage from wind, rain or other staff that might fall onto your vehicle (there's a rendering plant just outside of Edmonton that I used to work at and we definitely had complaints about entrails falling off on the roadways). Also less likely someone will steal anything from your vehicle if you have to park because if they can't see what's inside it they probably won't bother going to the trouble of finding out, unlike the bed of a truck where it's easy to see and grab.\n\nSecondly, if for some reason you can't fit it in a van the next best option would be a trailer. Depending on your need this can be flat deck or with sides. Still way more room than your box and leaves your rear view less obstructive. And depending on the kind of trailer you might not even need a truck, just need to have the right hitch. \n\nI've moved plenty of times in my life, helped others move as well and my dad owns his own trucking company so I've seen a lot.

There are a lot of people that just on a whim may need to move things that they either don't want/need in an enclosed space.

I can't tell you how many times I wish I had a truck bed to throw some chopped logs in as i'm just driving around daily.  Not having to piss around finding a truck or van or trailer to rent or borrow every time I wanted to pick up something like a large appliance would be just a bonus.  \n\nSome people really do move things a lot.

{"text": "Here's the chat gpt response. More of a choice looks like. \n\n\"\nPapuan tribes, particularly those from the highlands of Papua New Guinea, have historically developed unique combat practices, including varied use of shields or, in some cases, not using them at all. Whether or not Papuan tribes use shields in warfare depends on several cultural, environmental, and practical factors:\n\n1. Geographical and Environmental Considerations:\n\n\nDense Terrain: The dense rainforests and rugged mountains of Papua New Guinea make carrying large shields cumbersome. In areas where mobility and quick movement are crucial due to the terrain, tribes may prefer lighter weapons or rely on stealth and agility rather than cumbersome defensive gear.\n\n\nVisibility and Ambush: In heavily forested regions, ambushes and surprise attacks are common, making heavy shields less practical as they could slow down quick retreats or tactical movements.\n\n\n2. Cultural Practices and Combat Style:\n\n\nEmphasis on Offensive Tactics: Some Papuan tribes emphasize offensive tactics, focusing on projectile weapons like spears, bows, and arrows. The use of long-range weapons can reduce the perceived need for personal defensive equipment like shields.\n\n\nRitual and Display: In some cases, warfare in Papua New Guinea has a significant ritual component. The emphasis might be on demonstrating bravery or adhering to cultural combat traditions that don\u2019t involve shields.\n\n\nCeremonial Use vs. Practical Use: Some tribes may have shields that are used in ceremonial contexts or as status symbols but are not necessarily employed in actual warfare.\n\n\n3. Material and Resource Availability:\n\n\nResource Scarcity: Constructing durable shields requires access to specific types of wood, plant fibers, or animal hides. Tribes in regions where such resources are scarce may have opted not to develop shield-making traditions.\nMaterial Strength: Some areas may have materials that are too heavy or fragile for effective shield-making, influencing a preference for lightweight combat strategies instead.\n\n\n4. Social and Historical Context:\n\n\nIntertribal Warfare Norms: The nature of conflict between tribes might have influenced their weapons and defensive tools. In some regions, warfare might have involved skirmishes where maneuverability was prioritized over prolonged defensive encounters.\n\n\nEvolution of Tactics: As warfare tactics evolved over time, some tribes may have shifted away from using shields due to changes in the weapons used or the influence of outside technologies and cultural exchanges.\n\n\n5. Specific Examples of Tribes and Practices:\n\n\nHighland Tribes: Tribes in the highlands, such as the Huli and Dani, have been known to engage in warfare that sometimes involves shields, but not always. Their shields might be small and used alongside spears or arrows but could be absent when warfare emphasizes speed and surprise.\n\n\nLowland Tribes: Some lowland tribes might not use shields because their warfare is more reliant on ambush tactics or quick raids, where a shield would hinder movement.\n\n\nIn summary, while some Papuan tribes do use shields, their use varies based on environmental factors, combat style, cultural traditions, and resource availability. The decision to use or not use shields is a result of strategic adaptations to the local context of warfare and survival.\"", "label": 1}

{"text": "Here, let me put it in a way that might make sense to your sharp whit and critical mind:\n\n\nPeople generally prefer real human-generated Reddit comments over those generated by bots like ChatGPT because human comments bring a mix of authenticity, personal experience, and creativity that AI can struggle to fully replicate. Here are a few key reasons:\n\nAuthenticity and Emotion: Real people share comments based on their lived experiences, emotions, and personal insights. This makes their responses more relatable and genuine. In contrast, AI can generate insightful responses, but it often lacks that natural, nuanced human touch.\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Every person has unique perspectives shaped by their culture, background, and values. This diversity leads to a rich tapestry of viewpoints in Reddit threads that AI, despite being trained on a vast dataset, can't fully capture.\n\nHumor and Personality: The humor on Reddit, especially with niche or subcultural jokes, is often spontaneous and sometimes obscure. People enjoy the unpredictability and quirks that come from real individuals rather than a response that might feel polished but flat.\n\nReactions and Real-Time Relevance: Humans can respond to comments in real-time, referencing specific events, trending topics, or new developments. AI can do some of this, but without a live feed of current events, it sometimes misses subtle contextual references or timely responses.\n\nCredibility and Trust: Users often want to know that they\u2019re conversing with a real person because it assures them the comment is an authentic opinion rather than a generated response. There's an implicit trust when you know someone is real, particularly if they\u2019re offering advice or sharing a personal experience.\n\nCommunity Norms and Self-Moderation: Reddit communities often develop specific norms and insider knowledge that regular members understand and respect. Human commenters are more likely to adhere to these norms, while an AI might unintentionally breach them or seem out of place.\n\nWhile AI can be helpful and informative, it's usually most appreciated for structured, factual responses, not for the organic, community-driven conversations Reddit is known for.", "label": 1}

Plus he's probably going to get to install 2 more Supreme Court justices, so any legal challenges to what he is doing will almost certainly fall in his favor.  \n\nThis election seemed to really drive home the point that the economy is the single biggest issue people vote on.
