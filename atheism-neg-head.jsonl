{"text": "In short, people are lazy. And I don't mean that as a super negative thing, what I mean is that people only have so much time and energy to spend on ideas, and in a lot of cases we need to take shortcuts. We don't have the ability to be PhDs in every topic, we don't even have the ability to pass average college courses on every topic. So we need to take shortcuts. We need to be lazy.\n\nWhen it comes to a lot of the ideas that religion hits, religious answers are a great way to get quick answers. People can't stand not having answers to questions, and religion provides lots of answers. They aren't good answers, or accurate answers, but most people would prefer to have an answer rather than having no answer at all. Even if the honest and accurate answer is that there is no answer. The comfort of having an answer is much stronger than the cold truth of not having an answer.\n\nBut *some* people don't want easy comforting answers. They want truth, even if it's the bleak cold hard truth. Some of these people accept the lack of answers and do not believe the answers given by religion that can not be backed up. These are atheists.\n\nOthers find the people of religion to hypocritical, dishonest, and abusive. These people leave the church and religion, and they see this as evidence against the idea of a god. These are also atheists.\n\nAnd then there are others that are atheists for other reasons. There's no one way to reach atheism. There's no one reason people are atheists.\n\nThankfully with the rise in access to information, more people are able to see through the facade of religion. Atheism doesn't have much in the way of spokespeople, a few philosophers and big name people who give talks and debates, but nothing like what a religion has. Like dedicated buildings constructed for the ideals of religion, atheism doesn't have that. Atheism doesn't have edicts that dictate people must go out and convert others to atheism. Atheism doesn't have a set of rules that are posted up at courthouses. Atheism doesn't have much of a \"culturec\" in the same way that a religion does.\n\nAs for the future, as long as access to knowledge and facts remains open and available and people want to have the facts over feelings, the number will grow. As long as religion can be kept out of places it doesn't belong, like politics and government, then it won't be forced upon as many people, so less indoctrination. Which always helps.", "label": 0}

Technically, there isn't REALLY a difference.\n\nThe main reason why people choose one label over the other is basically to indicate how strongly you feel that organized religion is stupid.  Agonistics \"don't know or care\" and think that it's a \"toss up\" - maybe god is real, maybe god isn't both are equally likely. Atheists, on the other hand, are firm in thinking that there's no reason to believe in god, therefore they don't and they think there's virtually no chance of god existing.

{"text": "TL;DR: Because it's taboo.\n\nWhat we make taboo, we give power over us. The allure of violating taboos is especially compelling for people (including but not limited to theists) who externalize their locus of control. The taboo is explicitly intended to restrict, so the question remains... what is being restricted, and why?\n\nGeorges Bataille (in *Erotism*) suggests that the intention behind taboos is to **restrain violence**, violence being inherent to nature. Our species' earliest taboos are around death (based on substantive evidence of ancient funerary rites) and sex, and the seemingly mysterious relationship between the two. Death and sensuality are bound up in each other in our inner life, and in the notion of the **continuity of being** that corresponds to the objective, physical reality that underscores all of our abstractions, that exists independently of our minds (with respect to the hard problem of consciousness, I am rejecting the idealist position). We are members of a species of discontinuous beings -- our consciousness is separated from other consciousnesses by an untraversable gulf. I do not experience what you experience, if you die it is not my death, etc; and because we cannot overcome this gulf, it retains an aura of mystery. We may experience a deep anguish over it. I expect the corollary for Christians is anguish related to a worldview that insists they are fundamentally separate from their god.\n\nInterestingly, sensuality is also bound up in anguish, sometimes experienced as a feeling of incompleteness or emotional pain at the lack of the Beloved, the object of our desires. The emotional pain can also cause physical pain -- we might say anguish drives our mating instincts. We project our desires onto the Beloved, and in a biological sense, all of this culminates in sex, an inherently violent physical act in which the participants experience varying degrees of absorption (losing track of the world around them), and a brief \"blotting out\" of consciousness during orgasm. In Bataille's terms, this is a fusion we're talking about, in which the participants are (in a manner of speaking) destroyed, becoming a single, continuous entity, however briefly, however symbolically.\n\nMusing on this framing, I can't help but think about the commonality of coping with death by having sex -- it is apparently quite common for couples to have sex after attending a funeral.\n\nAlso -- I think this idea touches on the very old, and Biblical, idea that sex makes us \"as one flesh\" with each other. We achieve this unity by a violent act. Taboos restrain violence.\n\nThe domain of taboo is SACREDNESS. Sacredness, conceptually, implies a setting-apart from mundane, daily, unstructured use. Let's take a well-known example: the Semitic proscription on the consumption of pork. The widely-understood rationale here is that swine are unclean.\n\nHowever, if we look far back enough in history, we find that the reasoning is quite different. According to *The Golden Bough*, the proscription actually traces back to the belief that **swine are sacred**. The original proscription was that pork should only be eaten on certain festivals, as was the case with other sacred animals (Frazier mentions that mice were similarly proscribed). Taboo sort of \"structures\" violent acts (sometimes proscribing altogether, sometimes limiting) and thus mediates our interaction with nature. **Key takeaway: transgressive acts, appropriately structured, are essentially sanctioned.**\n\nWhether or not we LIKE this framing, I can see how it speaks to the fundamental experience of embodiment as an animal, common to both theists and atheists, and why Christians might be especially compelled to violate their religious and cultural taboos on sex.\n\nThey just also happen to be regularly barred from access to sex education, contraception, family planning services, and women are often taught to be subservient to men. Throw that on top of all the anguish inherent to our mating behaviors that already drives us toward each other, especially in the full flower of our youth and the abundant sexual vigor that tends to come with it.\n\nNo wonder they're fucking even when they're not allowed. They can't resist... they barely understand what is happening to them. On some level, I think they also expect to be forgiven, because they're already \"saved\". There's definitely some doublethink going on there.", "label": 0}

{"text": "tl;dr---My understanding of this philosophical definition is that a gnostic is someone who *claims* to have knowledge, regardless of whether they actually have knowledge.\n\n# On Absolute Certainty\n\n>It\u2019s is not so much about the certainty - but knowledge has to be - by definition - true.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: there isn't a single definition of knowledge. However, we can have the discussion using the definition of \"justified true belief\". If you want to use that definition, though, you have to stick to it.\n\n>Why should theism/atheism have a special place were typically non-belief and not belief is proclaimed to not be known with absolute certainty?\n\nHere, you are using \"absolute certainty\" as your definition of knowledge, but you focus on \"justified true belief\" elsewhere. When I say I am an agnostic atheist, it is not because I lack absolute certainty (although I do), it is because I don't think that the claim \"no gods exist\" is justified. When I say I am gnostic about the moon, it is not because I have absolute certainty (I don't), it is because I think the claim \"the moon exists\" is justified, and that reality objectively exists, making the belief true. I could be wrong about those things, but I still claim to know the moon exists.\n\n# On Justified True Belief\n\nI think you misunderstand my objection to your third point. It is impossible for us to know which justified beliefs are true and which ones aren't. There is an objective reality (at least, I am assuming we can agree there is an objective reality), but it is impossible for us to tell which justified beliefs are true and which ones are not true.\n\n*Regardless*, that doesn't matter when it comes to gnostic claims. A gnostic atheist is not someone who has knowledge that no gods exist, and a gnostic theist is not someone who has knowledge that some god exists. No, a gnostic atheist is someone who *claims* to have knowledge that no gods exist, and a gnostic theist is someone who *claims* to have knowledge that some god exists.\n\nThe gnostic might have knowledge, or they might not. All that you need to say a gnostic exists is to point to someone claiming to know something. You were saying that gnostic atheists and gnostic theists can't both logically exist, but that's not true because gnostic atheists and gnostic theists do exist. A married bachelor cannot exist logically, and they do not actually exist. If something actually exists, it is logically impossible for it to be logically impossible.\n\nGnostic theists and gnositc atheists don't have to be correct in their claim of knowledge in order to exist. They just have to make the claim. I believe they are both wrong to make knowledge claims, but I am not going to say they aren't making a claim---which is what you are doing.\n\nIt seems like you think that in order for someone to make a gnostic claim, they have to have access to the objective truth, i.e., they can't be wrong. My understanding of this particular philosophical definition is that we don't have access to the objective truth, so we can't have a justified true belief about which justified beliefs are true and which ones aren't. However, that doesn't stop us from claiming to know things, it just stops us from being able to assess knowledge claims on the basis of truth. That is, people can claim to know something and be wrong about it.", "label": 0}

But the more I read and learned the more obvious it became, so I slowly began to accept that I was at least agnostic, but I'd only share that with people I trusted. Years later, I now realize why atheism was treated as such a dirty word. They just didn't have any good arguments against it so they did the next best thing they could, which was to apply social pressure to conform to the religious tradition so they could keep their dominant position in society despite being based entirely on epistemological ignorance. Now I'm proud to have overcome the cultural pressure to conform and to prove that atheists aren't all bad people like I was raised to believe.

This is a process that can take a long time. There are plenty of former christian atheists who still have a fear of hell decades after they stopped believing in it. It's easier for some people than for others.\n\nOne thing you can consider trying is sharing your story, but I can understand if you don't want to do that. You can also try going to therapy (check out the secular therapy project).\n\nTrying to find a community of like-minded people can also be helpful, but you might have trouble since pagans are already such a small fraction of the population. I honestly have no clue whether there are more pagans or more former pagans out there. If you can't find a community of former pagans, it could be helpful to focus on what you do believe.\n\nYou aren't looking to convert to anything else, but focus on why you want to deconvert in the first place. Who do you want to be tomorrow? What would it take to be them? Try not to focus on what you need to leave behind, but what you need to pick up.

However, I wanted to discuss the question primarily from the definition of JTB. If absolute certainty derives from claiming knowledge, your moon knowledge has to be absolute certainty. \n\nIf you claim that you know (JTB) that the moon exist, you have to have a method of knowing it to be true - could this be done without certainty?\n\nYou seem to only need a belief to be justified to constitute knowledge? If this is the case, you simply reject the JTB, and of course - then my post could be nonsense since it depends on that. If we only think that justified belief is enough for knowledge and reject JTB, i think \u201cagnosticism\u201d makes even less sense. If I didn\u2019t think that there is a justification for not thinking that any gods exist - why would I be an atheist? (But this could be a separate discussion)\n\nWe could claim that reality objectively exist, the question in philosophy is however if we have access to it, or only a model of it. \n\nI do understand there are multiple definitions of knowledge, but if we don\u2019t use the same here - the discussion is pointless. \n\n**justified true belief**\n\nOk, so we seem to agree that knowledge may be impossible to have (this is one of my major premises), which makes the prefix specifically for the godclaim pointless since it doesn\u2019t give any information. \n\nSure, one can _claim_ to have knowledge, but my point is that one of gnostic atheists and gnostic theist don\u2019t _actually_ have knowledge. Of course one could be mistaken, but if we look from the perspective of a gnostic theists - this positions necessarily means that \u201cgnostic atheists don\u2019t exist\u201d, only people who think they are - but as you say, they could be wrong. \n\nMy question is then, if we acknowledge that the gnostic theist could be wrong about having knowledge and only _claim_ to have it. What use does the \u201cgnostic\u201d term fill?

The challenges we face - climate change, nuclear proliferation, global pandemics - demand a rational, evidence-based approach to problem-solving. This is where the limitations of traditional religious dogma become painfully apparent.\n\nFor millennia, we looked to the heavens for answers, seeking divine explanations for natural phenomena. While religion has provided comfort and community, it often obstructs our understanding of the universe as it truly is.\n\nThe scientific method, however, offers a rigorous framework for understanding the cosmos. It demands skepticism, critical thinking, and a willingness to revise our beliefs in the face of new evidence, the importance of questioning authority and relying on empirical data, not blind faith.\nThe idea of a deity who intervenes capriciously in the world, dictating our fates, is not only incompatible with our observations of the universe, but also hinders our ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nTo truly progress, we must move beyond the limitations of myth and embrace the power of scientific exploration. This doesn\u2019t mean rejecting spirituality altogether, but rather re-framing it within the context of our vast and awe-inspiring universe.\n\nWhere we see ourselves as part of a larger interconnected web of life, not as the center of creation. When we understand the incredible fragility of our planet, the vastness of space, and the preciousness of life, we are more likely to act with compassion and responsibility towards each other and the environment.\nWe can no longer afford to be guided by ancient beliefs that may have served us in the past but now threaten our future. It is time to embrace the power of reason, critical thinking, and scientific inquiry to build a better world for all, by overcoming religious dogma to fully engage with the scientific understanding of our universe.\n\n[Why Humanity Must Overcome Religion | Carl Sagan](https://youtu.be/-EdmF4OyoKI)", "label": 0}

So it's possible to be both. I know I am! You can continue calling yourself agnostic, though this doesn't really answer any questions about what you believe. \n* Skeptic: a skeptic is someone who tries to withhold action until provided with evidence to a certain standard. You can be skeptical about aliens, or about homeopathics, or the shape of the Earth, or the existence of immortal powerful creatures. \n* Bright: a Bright is someone who focuses on intellect as a virtue. Better to believe things because they're true, even if they're not \"nice\" or \"kind\" beliefs. Brights prefer hard truths.\n* Humanist: someone who believes that we should work for the betterment of humans specifically. We should care for the planet because we live here, we should cure cancer because people have cancer, we should care for each other because we all matter. \n* None: someone who isn't religious. No strong beliefs about whether supernatural stuff exists, and a willingness to be proven wrong. But not actively searching. \n\nThese are not exclusive, you can identify as some of these, or none of these, or all of these.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> What methodology did you employ to know which parts are myth as opposed to non-myth?\n\nModern historians have tests for this.  It is a problem when reading a the works of Greek and Roman historians of the era.  There are words by real historians who are attempting to report historical events or historical biographies.  They are considered serious history, but they sometimes included mythical elements.  Therefore historians need tests for what materials are mythical and should be excluded from their understanding of likely historical events.\n\nThe gospels and Acts have a lot of markers events that are mythical.  One is that they involve supernatural elements.  Another is when the story involves elements that are grossly exaggerated or contradict known elements.  Another marker of mythology is when the story seems to echo common themes and motifs from mythology.  \n\nAs an example, take the Sea of Galilee.\n\nFactually, the Sea of Galilee does not exist as it is described in Mark and the other gospels.  In the gospels, the Sea of Galilee is wracked with frequent storms, and it took a multi-day sailing trip to cross it.  However, geography can be verified.  There is a lake that was known as  Lake Tiberias or Lake Kinneret.  It is a freshwater lake.  At the time of Jesus, it was about half the size of the modern body of water.  It is surrounded on three sides by mountains that protect it from storms.  It was known to be a tranquil body of water.    The Sea of Galilee hits several markers of mythology just based on mundane facts of geography.\n\nThere are also pointers in Mark and the other gospels that the stories about the Sea of Galilee are mythical.  It is common in Greek mythology for the hero of the story to calm a raging sea during a storm.  It is common for the hero to run, ride a horse, or drive a chariot across the surface of a sea in order to demonstrate their mastery of nature.\n\nGreek stories needed storm-tossed seas, but the Galilee and Jerusalem area were inconveniently lacking a sea.  So the author of Mark transformed the tranquil  Lake Tiberias into the raging Sea of Galilee.  Then he told about Jesus calming storms and walking on water, which are patterned of the actions of Greek heroes from mythology.\n\n> Which parts aren't mythology? \n\nI think there are some things about Jesus that are more likey than not to be true.\n\n* Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher who was associated with John the Baptist (John the Baptist was a known historical figure)\n* Jesus was crucified, probably for a crime like sedition.  (That was common)\n* Jesus had a brother named James. (Paul claimed to have met James.  Also Josephus tells a credible story about political intrigue involving James the brother of Jesus)\n* Jesus had some devoted followers.  They probably included Peter and Mary.\n* Jesus was probably from Nazareth (The Gospels and Acts seem to acknowledge that Jesus was known to be from Nazareth.  That was an inconvenient because the early Christians thought the Messiah needed to be from Bethlehem.)", "label": 0}

I also went to a private school, where we had religion classes... both of them, I thought \"This is B.S.\", so I called myself an athiest.\n\nBut... my 2 favorite faculty members and the ones who helped me the most with guidance were the Chaplains. And they were never \"This is what Jesus says, you better do it\", it was more offering some guidance and parable or some such to help me figure things out on my own. Later on, I started calling myself a \"Secular Christian\", because the actual quotes attributed to Jesus Christ, I felt there was a truth to them. The divinity stuff, nope, cannot buy it. I'd be like Thomas Jefferson cutting words out of his Bible because he seemed to like the philosophy, but the supernatural stuff seemed bull. Don't give me the OT, Jesus rejected a lot of that, and don't give me stuff that Paul wrote (in fact, 2 of the 4 Gospels that are \"accepted\" are not from Jesus' direct disciples; so, that's 1 out of 6 listed disciples we hear from), but there are some good ideas in there to lead a better life and live better among other people and support each other. \n\nSo, I try to live by that little bit, and call myself a \"Secular Christian\" as it seems to fit me best.

I struggled with the label of atheist because of the social and moral implications and the religious view of what happens to those who denounce God. Saying I was an atheist made me feel like I was doing something really wrong, even if I didn't truly believe that I actually was. I worked a lot on coming to terms with my beliefs on my own and with my spouse before I was ever ready to confront them on a larger scale. It was nerve-wracking to lose a core piece of myself and have to find a new system of values.\n\nNot too long after I'd become confident enough to tell my friends that I was an atheist, but had yet to tell my family, I briefly stepped back into the religious community again for work. Sitting through church and listening to the beliefs I truly disagreed with really sodified the term atheist for me and allowed me to tell my family. I definitely wouldn't recommend actively seeking out religious involvement, especially for an extended period of time- it really took a toll on my mental health. However, at the end of the day, I knew the preachings were not what I believed or the values that I held, and that really helped solidify my new perspective.\n\nWhile there are still things I struggle to come to terms with about not believing in the things that I was so sure were true, I know that deep down, I have good intentions in the way I carry myself. In terms of religious labels, we don't have to select one in permanent ink and advertise it publically. Some days, you may be agnostic, and you may be confidently atheist others - I think that's okay. If you need to avoid the conversation with some people, like family or fib your way through it, that's okay too.
