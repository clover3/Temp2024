Here are a few ways the DNC, under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, marginalized Bernie Sanders:\n\n1. **Superdelegates** - The DNC could have controlled their party insiders such that the contest wasn't painted in a negative light for Bernie. -*Before a single primary vote was ever cast*-, DNC insiders pushed the narrative that Hilary had already won the contest. The DNC could have controlled this but did not. This is the one thing that the DNC did change after Debbie Wasserman Shultz left her post, immediately after HRC's primary win, to join HRC's campaign.\n\n2. **Debate cheating** - Donna Brazile, the Vice Chair of the DNC, shared questions with the Clinton campaign ahead of both town halls and debates.\n\n3. **Data breach favoritism** - A month before the Iowa caucus, the first contest in the Democratic primary, the DNC shut off the Sanders' campaign's access to the shared DNC voter information. The system the DNC used was broken and had **PREVIOUSLY** leaked the opposition's voter data in favor of both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. Think about it like a Google for voters with a firewall in between. This firewall was broken and previously leaked information to **BOTH CAMPAIGNS.** This system was vital to voter outreach, including targeting voters and organizing volunteers. The Sanders campaign did not do anything in this \"breach\" that the Clinton campaign had not also done **AND THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN IS THE ONE WHO REPORTED IT TO THE DNC**.\n\n4. **Media narrative** - Somewhat related to #3 but also broader, Debbie Wasserman Schutz, in defense of shutting off voter access and the \"fairness\" of the contest, went on national media, such as CNN, and fought against Jeff Weaver, Tad Devine, and Nina Turner--campaign managers, strategists, and surrogates working for Bernie Sanders. This could not be read as anything other than favoritism. Release a statement. Strife for impartiality. There are a dozen moves. Attacking one side of the contest is not the move.\n\n5. **Internal Emails** - While likely leaked by Russia via Wikileaks (this has never been definitively proven), the leaked DNC emails demonstrated what Bernie Sanders supporters already knew: that DWS and the many DNC officials were secretly cheering *against* Sanders, at times going so far as to suggest ways of defeating Sanders, such as attacking his religion, planting stories in the media, and directly shaping narratives against Bernie with media contacts--all while the Democratic primary was underway.\n\nWhile I mentioned this at the top, I think it's important to reiterate that Debbie Wasserman Shultz, the head of the DNC, directly after HRC's primary victory, went directly to work for the HRC campaign. It doesn't get any more obvious than that.\n\nSaying \"oh but Sanders lost\" is just so immensely reductive. We will truly never know if, in a fair contest, Sanders could have beaten Clinton and what could have happened next. That is what people are still upset about.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> The DNC iS cORRuPT! \n\n* Giving Hillary - and only Hillary -  the [debate questions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dnc-interim-chairwoman-passed-debate-questions-along-to-clinton-campaign/) before the debate.\n\n* [In a class-action lawsuit](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/dnc-lawyer-reportedly-said-they-could-have-chosen-between-clinton-sanders-over-cigars-in-back-rooms/) by Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee, lawyers for the DNC arguing they could have chosen their nominee over cigars in a backroom...the primary voters and democracy be damned. \n\n* The DNC charter, article 5, section 4, requires that the Chair exercise impartiality and evenhandedness in its preparation and conduct of the presidential nominating process. The DNC and Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued in court, \u201cDNC charter\u2019s promise of \u2018impartiality and evenhandedness\u2019 as a mere political promise\u2014political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts.\u201d So in their defense, the DNC argued that they never promised not to rig the primary.\n\n* The superdelegates pledging for Clinton early in the primary campaign creating a sense of inevitability. Public perception was that Clinton held a commanding lead before many states even held their votes. This could be seen as the democratic establishment choosing the candidate instead of letting the people decide in state votes. Wasserman Schultz went on to say, \u201cUnpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don\u2019t have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists.\u201d \n\n* The DNC claimed that Bernie staffers had hacked the Hillary side of the voter database and used it as a pretext to freeze Bernie's access to the voter database. In reality, both sides had access to each other's data and the Bernie side realized, ran a few searches to see how extensive the security breach was, and reported it to the DNC. The DNC used that as a pretext to block Bernie's access to the data collected by his own staff to hamper Bernie's turn out the vote effort. Bernie had to sue to get access back.\n\n* [Limiting the number of debates](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/252227-sanders-dnc-using-debates-to-rig-primary/).\n\n* Before the convention, Hillary\u2019s campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races. Money donated to the DNC was [funneled almost exclusively to Hillary.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774/) A Politico story described this arrangement as \u201cessentially \u2026 money laundering\u201d for the Clinton campaign. Donna Brazile said,\"If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.\" \n\n* The leaked Podesta emails showed the DNC actively working to keep Sanders from being considered. This even forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as the head of the DNC.\n\n* Bernie got screwed over by Clinton delegates at the Nevada primary that would determine who to send to the ballot. They took an aye or nay vote and the lady conducting the vote claimed Hillary won the vote but audibly it sounded like Bernie had won. Sanders camp asked for a roll call vote so as to determine who the actual winner was but was denied by the vote lady. This was against the rules as the rules require a roll call vote if requested. Hillary was declared the winner by the vote lady who closed the session and quickly left the room so as not to deal with the aftermath of what she had just done. And Bernie camp was left with no recourse to remedy the situation at that point.\n\n**Whether Bernie would have won if the DNC had not put their thumb on the scales is a different discussion; however, there is no denying the DNC acted in an [underhanded, corrupt manner.](https://youtu.be/I8qBexfR3r4)**", "label": 0}

His administration might have pushed for sweeping reforms like Medicare for All, free public college tuition, and aggressive measures to combat climate change, such as the Green New Deal. The Democratic Party could have undergone a dramatic transformation, moving further left and invigorating a new generation of activists and voters. Economic policies aimed at reducing wealth inequality and reigning in corporate power would have faced fierce opposition from Republicans and establishment Democrats, likely resulting in legislative gridlock or intense political battles. Internationally, Sanders' non-interventionist approach and focus on human rights could have reshaped U.S. foreign policy, impacting relationships with allies and adversaries alike. The populist energy that fueled his campaign might have changed the trajectory of American politics, perhaps blunting the rise of Trumpism or at least shifting the terms of the national debate.", "label": 0}

In the Steven Spielberg movie \"E.T.,\" why is the alien brown? No reason. In \"Love Story,\" why do the two characters fall madly in love with each other? No reason. In Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" why is the President suddenly assassinated by some stranger? No reason. In the excellent \"Chain Saw Massacre\" by Tobe Hooper, why don't we ever see the characters go to the bathroom or wash their hands like people do in real life? Absolutely no reason. Worse, in \"The Pianist\" by Polanski, how come this guy has to hide and live like a bum when he plays the piano so well? Once again the answer is, no reason. I could go on for hours with more examples. The list is endless. You probably never gave it a thought, but all great films, without exception, contain an important element of no reason.

BUT Israel and America ties is a messy complicated issue and I don\u2019t expect a radical policy change so soon or at least during a presidential race. \nConsidering how either left or right was most likely going to give weapons to Israel and be lenient on their actions I voted for the left bc 1) as a queer person who has sisters and nieces, loved ones ect of multiple backgrounds their well being is a priority for me. Even if it was so personal I will vote to protect the rights and well being of my own countrymen first bc it\u2019s impossible to have ur cake and eat it to when it comes to protecting everyone or many at risk groups/peoples in the world. Hell the US maybe barely does it for themselves and 2) the left won\u2019t be as bad as the right on the the Palestine Israel issue which is something when having to make a choice between 2 things and 3) any perceived improved economic or social status from either not voting left or voting right is just wrong  and even if they were to improve my economic status is not worth compromising point #1. Back to Israel Palestine which is showing to be a really big issue for voters. It sucks to be in that choice or which one if both are gonna support weapons and administration that kill children but that\u2019s how the 2 party system works right now. I want more diverse and progressive candidates but I believe that starts with local, state and then rep/senate voting choices. But it\u2019s a long slow road to getting that in a presidential race and not compromising on that single political office is short sighted in my opinion. So yes it\u2019s very far from ideal but no matter what which administration won it\u2019s likely there will be more dead children and innocent people but I can still vote for an administration that will be better for its own people and hopefully better for those in other countries.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Definitely agree, which was why I think that he was such a great (and unexpected) pick for Harris.

I couldn't find any facts as to what they were basing that off of, but thought it was interesting.\n\nIt's too bad the Harris campaign didn't run with that progressive bend and instead tried to curry the favor of \"flipping\" Republicans. While that's all very nice, it always seemed that they're the exception, not the rule, and I feel like the Republicans who didn't want Trump to win just wouldn't vote for him regardless of whether the DNC pandered to them or not. I also thought they were leaning a little too much on the \"secret woman\" voter. I think you can get conservative women (and people in general) to vote against party on issues (abortion measures, etc., but I don't think that translates to actually voting against party on national races for seats of power as often as the DNC seems to think it does.

{"text": "[Full article]\n\nWill the Democratic elite learn anything from her defeat?\n\nBy Freddie Hayward\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s favourite spot when she studied at Howard University in the 1980s was a large, grass-covered area in the middle of campus called the Yard. She would stand there and watch the musicians playing instruments and the medics leaving the lab, the students laughing together. \u201cThat was the beauty of Howard,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cEvery signal told students that we could be anything \u2013 we were young, gifted, and black \u2013 and we shouldn\u2019t let anything get in the way of our success.\u201d Forty years later, the Yard was where Harris hoped to declare her ascension to the American presidency.\n\nBut it was not to be. There, yesterday afternoon (6 November), in front of a small crowd of supporters, staffers and Howard students, she conceded defeat. Her uplifting tone was unbowed. She delivered a message of defiant hope. \u201cMy heart is full today \u2013 full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve,\u201d she said. She sought to inspire her supporters to continue the fight against the type of politics which Trump represents, a politics she left undefined. \u201cWhile I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign \u2013 the fight for freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power.\u201d\n\nIt was surreal. Her positivity created the impression that Harris hadn\u2019t really lost, that the entire reason for everyone being there was not now redundant, that the Republicans hadn\u2019t (almost certainly) won the popular vote for the first time since 2004. She had no contrition for the loss, nor did she try to wrestle with the reasons behind her defeat. The message was the opposite: keep calm and carry on, stay the course, keep going. She spoke as if nothing had gone wrong and the strategy had delivered. Her finale was characteristic of her campaign: \u201cI know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.\u201d It was at this point that people around me started giggling.\n\nMinutes before Harris mounted the stage, a statement from Senator Bernie Sanders began pinging onto attendees\u2019 phones. It was a stinging rebuke of everything she was about to say. It read: \u201cIt should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them\u2026 While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cWill the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?\u2026 Probably not.\u201d\n\nThis was a furious indictment of the Democratic Party. It echoed David Axelrod\u2019s comment on CNN that the party treated the working class like \u201cnatives\u201d who needed to be civilised. Despite his opposition to the administration\u2019s supplying of weapons to Israel, Sanders endorsed Harris. But his statement yesterday marked the first shot in the fight over why the party lost, the conclusion of which will dictate its direction over the next four years. Dissenters are already criticising Harris for cosying up to Republicans like Liz Cheney, for diluting Biden\u2019s economic populism and for relying on shallow and incoherent messaging. Expect a reckoning on Gaza, while some quiet voices are raising concerns about the party\u2019s failure to stop illegal migrant crossings.\n\nOn the opposite side, Harris\u2019s staffers are already briefing that the blame\u00a0should fall on Joe Biden\u2019s refusal to stand down in good time. But the Democrats are in trouble if the focus remains on the timing of Biden\u2019s exit. If Harris had more time, would she have won? Isn\u2019t there a risk that the more the public got to know her, the worse the result would have been?\n\nHer concession speech was a sign that the party elite will plough on as before, unreflective about the distance between themselves and large swathes of the electorate. After the crowds started streaming out of the gates back towards the centre of Washington, one man cheerily remarked to a friend, \u201cyou know, I remember that Hillary also gave an\u00a0awesome\u00a0concession speech in 2016\u201d.\u00a0", "label": 0}
