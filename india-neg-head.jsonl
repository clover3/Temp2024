{"text": "Dear HR,\n\nI want to take a moment to address the aux misuse situation. Yes, I acknowledge that I was misusing the auxes. When my previous team leader, Anish, questioned me about my low call volume, I admitted to my actions and received a final warning letter. This was a difficult moment for me, one that I have reflected on deeply.\n\nMonths later, Anish shared in a team meeting that he had caught others toggling auxes but had only issued verbal warnings. In September, many advisors spent significant time on callback calls, some lasting over 30 minutes to an hour, yet they, too, received only verbal warnings for call avoidance from Shivson. This month, I noticed several advisors toggling their auxes while I was checking the queue. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I am being singled out, especially following a difficult conversation with Shivson.\n\nOn July 25, 2024, I faced a particularly challenging day, having to undergo surgery while my wife delivered our baby. I had requested 15 days of paid leave, including 5 days of paternity leave, four months in advance, but was denied by Shivson. He claimed that since I had already taken 2 months of leave for my prior hospitalization, he couldn\u2019t grant more than 2 days along with paternity leave, even though I had a paid leave balance available. I accepted this decision, but soon after, I was diagnosed with a hernia that required urgent surgery.\n\nUpon returning to work, I spoke with Anish about needing an additional four days of leave, only to find that Shivson had denied my request again. I explained that had my initial leave been approved, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask for these extra days. Anish arranged a meeting with Shivson and Jason, which felt predetermined. Within the first 15 minutes, I realized the meeting was simply to deny my leave. Despite my attempts to stop them, they dragged the conversation on for an hour, leaving me feeling defeated. \n\nAt the end of that meeting, Shivson mentioned that had I applied for my leave on Genesys 90 days in advance, it would have been approved. Ironically, he had previously denied my 15-day request for my wife\u2019s delivery while accepting only 2 days and 5 days of paternity leave. I struggle to understand why managers assure potential applicants that they can take as much leave as needed, only for that promise to vanish once they join the organization.\n\nDuring a skip meeting, Shivson referenced our previous conversation about my leave, making me feel as though I was being kept in mind for all the wrong reasons. It seems I am being unfairly targeted while others operate without consequences. I vividly recall our last conversation, where Shivson asked, \u201cWhy should we trust you?\u201d When I attempted to explain myself, he cut me off, declaring, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t trust you.\u201d This interaction left me feeling that his primary objective is to have me removed from Sterling.\n\nI do not wish to continue in a workplace where I feel like a target of a manager\u2019s scrutiny. This situation saddens me not only for myself but for any colleagues who may be experiencing similar hardships. I had a coaching session with Jeffrey on that day, where I expressed how disheartening it is to be on the verge of removal while still taking calls. His laughter at my situation felt like an indication of a toxic environment, making me feel as though there is a lack of empathy for employees who are struggling.\n\nI struggle to continue in a workplace where any misstep could lead to my being targeted, while others appear to be exempt from repercussions. Thank you for listening to my feelings during this difficult time.\n\nSincerely,", "label": 0}

Dyer notes that, although U.S.-India relations have progressed in technology and defense, recent allegations linking Indian officials to dissident murders in North America have strained the relationship. Yet, Washington appears to compartmentalise these issues to preserve its strategic partnership with India. Meanwhile, India\u2019s strong ties with Russia, a crucial arms supplier, bolster its ability to maintain a non-aligned stance amid global tensions. According to Dyer, India\u2019s unique position as a non-aligned power offers a diplomatic advantage, allowing it to balance relationships with rival powers and resist pressures to side with any bloc.", "label": 0}

But restaurants in NA usually stick to a very restrictive list. Most of the dishes will be from Punjabi cuisine - think Butter chicken, palak paneer (usually wrongly labelled as 'saag paneer' though they only use palak-spinach), koftas, mango lassi (not really popular in India though both lassi by itself and other Mango based drinks are so I guess it gets a pass) etc - with a few British Indian staples (chicken tikka masala, vindaloo) and maybe Dosa from the South.     \n\nOf course, restaurants often alter the method of preparation to suit local tastes, especially in areas without a huge Indian population. This is either by reducing spice levels or by increasing heat to ridiculous levels to attract those who treat Indian food as an extended version of the one chip challenge. Desserts are also usually made less sweet because most non-Indians find a lot of authentic Indian sweets to be cloying.        \n\nYou can find the \"authentic\" versions of familiar dishes along with restaurants specialising in regional cuisines in areas with higher Indian populations, like the tristate area, Dallas, the Bay area etc.", "label": 0}

Russia invaded Ukraine; while Ukraine is not part of the EU, one reason for Putin being land-greedy is that the EU is constantly expanding (unfortunately, assimilating poor countries which need financial support). So it was clear that this will alienate Russia, even without Putin's mafia regime in power. So the EU cut itself off here, largely due to US doing geopolitical games here. Now, with Russia out, it is also instantly clear that Russia could not sustain its ware without support from China - and thus dictator Xi.\n\nSo now China is also hostile. The EU is running out of options here. Thus it makes sense to assume that India is the largest democracy in the world (it sort of is, actually), even though Modi is an ultra-nationalist. Of course it would be better if India were led by democratic forces, but which alternatives does the EU have here? India is huge; it is already the fifth largest economy world-wide and that will only grow. So, between Russia, China and India, the EU supporting India makes the most \"logical sense\", even with ultra-nationalist Modi and his clique in power.

{"text": "Half of Germany was socialist till 90. They inherited many of those policies. I will give you the specific examples below, but some gyaan before that - every country has its problems. There are a lot of aspects we do not think or know of before coming to these countries. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t come, but you have to understand that there would be many things which would make you think India\u2019s far better in these aspects. Ultimately, it\u2019s what you prefer; for me, having breathable air for my child was more important than everything else combined (coming from a family full of breathing issues).\n\nExamples:\n1. Your visa expired, and while you\u2019re allowed to continue staying because you have applied for a residence permit, you don\u2019t know when you will get an appointment (no you can\u2019t book). So, you cannot travel outside Germany.  You can get fiction visa (temp) but they don\u2019t communicate before sending it over so you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming. My sister has not been able to travel to India for 2 years because her temp visa expires exactly during my niece\u2019s school holidays every time. And she usually receives the temp visa a few weeks after the expiration of the last one. \n2. A friend of mine had his wife\u2019s visa application stuck for 8 months between 2 departments because he has same date of birth and full name as another person. We don\u2019t have an aadhaar like unique ID here (technically there is but\u2026) so a combination of name and dob is how they identify you.\n3. I had a duplicate pension number created because of the same dob problem. My new exploder mentioned wrong dob and they did not look at the unique tax ID to identify of the person exists or not. \n4. Talking about gender equality, when filling taxes as a family they expect man to be the first person entry followed by the wife. When my wife was freelancing this caused many issues because every time she made a payment it would reflect in my tax id and we would both receive letters - mine to explain the payment source and her to explain the missing payment. Eventually we went the German way and paid a tax consultant hundreds of euros to take care of this. \n5. Every govt office you go to will be a different experience for you, and your experience will likely be different from others around you because it depends on the person interacting with you. They can take decisions for you- to give you a residence permit or not, not consider your German knowledge to be basic or not, to give you a temp visa or not. As most government workflows are not automated, you are at the mercy of the front line govt employees.\n\nIndia has improved significantly with egov starting 2000s and here it has started now.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I am a U.S. citizen, born in Delhi, who has lived in the U.S. since 2006. I live on the East Coast, often spending time in cities like Boston and New York, which have vibrant Indian communities. Here, I\u2019ve observed a variety of experiences and attitudes within the diaspora.\n\n\nAmong the Indian population in the U.S., many people have successfully integrated, balancing Indian heritage with American values. They retain Indian culture while fully embracing American norms, blending the best of both worlds. This group is generally well-educated, with strong civic sense and behavior that aligns with mainstream American society.\n\n\nHowever, around 20% of the diaspora seems to struggle with adapting certain social norms. This can often manifest as an inclination to prioritize self-interest, a habit developed through India\u2019s competitive environment, where it's every man for himself. Courtesy and consideration for others aren\u2019t always emphasized in such an environment, and the lack of feedback reinforces these habits.\n\n\nFor some, even after 30 years in the U.S., these habits remain. They hold onto attitudes from their life in India, often in ways that seem out of place here. This sometimes translates to a lack of civic awareness or empathy for others, contributing to an image that doesn\u2019t represent the positive qualities many associate with the Indian-American community.\n\n\n\n\nI only visit India every five or six years, and I observe the same behaviors. I don\u2019t expect my generation to change, and I hope younger generations develop greater civic sense and empathy, which could positively impact India\u2019s image over time.\n\n\nPerceptions of Indians vary by country. In the U.S., Indians are generally well-regarded. However, in Canada, the reputation has declined as more people, often less familiar with integration, have migrated. I often tell people here in the U.S. that the Indians they meet aren\u2019t necessarily representative of the average.\n\n\nThis reflection is more of a rant.\u00a0 Take it for what it\u2019s worth.", "label": 0}

It's just, our net population is so high that the overall numbers are very spiked up. \n\nWhat I am saying is (and you are in Finance, so you will understand) that if you are in a room with 5 Indians and 5 Australians, an Australian is more likely to rape you. Similarly, if you create a country with 5 indians and 5 Australians, the pollution produced by the 5 Australians will be significantly higher than the pollution created by the 5 Indians.  \n\nWith that being said, I will also add the other point, that you are more likely to be raped in India and your health will be more damaged by pollution in India as opposed to Australia just because we have so many people here. \n\nNow why do we have so many people here?

{"text": "Not an Indian myself, but I\u2019ve spent a few months in your beautiful country, and know many ex-pat Indians in Australia. Let me offer an outside perspective.\n\nSomething that struck me when I first went to India was obviously the population density, but then I noticed the social cohesion and harmony despite the fact there\u2019s so many people. Sure, there\u2019s some annoying traits (spitting, uncles yelling, rubbish), but I don\u2019t believe those traits are any more frequent per capita/person, just that when there\u2019s so many people, of course that means the number of ding-dongs (for lack of a better term) is higher.\n\nIn many parts of the world, you simply couldn\u2019t sustain such a population without experiencing similar (or worse) problems. Look at all dense populations around the world, and they\u2019re famous for rude people (NYC, London, Rome- China is a notable exception, but maybe not lol). \n\nWhile lack of civic sense is infuriating, especially when you feel it reflects on yourself on behalf of others, to me it\u2019s a natural negative result of a wonderful trait: tolerance.\n\nPoor civic sense behaviours seem to me to be a direct result of interpersonal tolerance, patience and forgiveness, and a fundamental good will to keep the peace for the sake of cohesion. Unfortunately, it can get out of hand, and people start depending on that tolerance to get away with shitty behaviour, but it strikes me as ignorance instead of malice. \n\nIn my country, we have a special word that means \u201chey, that thing you\u2019re doing is contrary to commonly held understandings of the right thing\u201d. We say \u201cOI!\u201d \ud83e\udd19 works a treat. Gives some people a fright though. Most of the time people are almost sleep walking, they just need a little wake up.\n\nI\u2019m just an outsider, so take my word for what it is, but rest assured not all foreigners see Indians how you did recently, bhai. All good traits can have an unforeseen negative consequence. If you could choose to make everyone in India perfect civilly responsible citizens, but take away the beauty of a (relatively) harmonious and tolerant dense population, would you do it?\n\nIn my country, we also have people with bad civic sense. We call them \u201cgrubs\u201d or sometimes \u201cbogans\u201d if that applies. When people behave that way in public, there\u2019s a moderate chance they\u2019ll be called out. Drop rubbish? You\u2019re likely to hear a \u201cOI!\u201d from somewhere and be met with a grumpy face and finger pointed at your rubbish. BUT, here\u2019s the other side:\n\nBy contrast, if Mammaji gets lost at the airport and starts quietly stressing by herself, no one in my country will help her. Sure, they might eventually, but there\u2019s a good chance she will be spoken down to by a rushed staff member, and even if there\u2019s hundred of people walking past, it\u2019s very unlikely someone will stop to help. \n\nEach time I go to India I\u2019m struck by how many people randomly help strangers. From simple directions, to notifying of hazards, to wiping the snot off a kid\u2019s face. And then there\u2019s constant efforts to build mutual trust. Where I\u2019m from, if you want to buy a small bottle of water but you\u2019re short a few cents, the shop owner will NEVER give it to you until you\u2019re fully paid up, even if you\u2019ve known them for years. It still blows my mind that people in India take those small financial risks with each other all the time.\n\nAnyway, please forgive my intrusion. I am but an outsider from a foreign (arguably racist) country, who sees these problems you\u2019re seeing and thinks \u201cif I had to trade the good sides for the downsides, give me the litter every time\u201d \ud83d\ude0a", "label": 0}

{"text": "I had lived abroad (Singapore) for more than 3 years and in all those years I never saw the locals breaking the (unwritten) laws of basic proper social conduct/etiquette that is to be observed in public settings. \n\nI would take the public transport (bus or metro) on a regular basis and the general behaviour of the locals is to maintain 'a level of silence' so as to not disturb others. People do talk in buses and trains but it would never be loud or disrupting and even the TV that you find installed on local buses are muted (extremely low volume). You won't be able to hear the TV news anchor's voice unless you sit close to the TV (it is that low in volume).\n\nThe first time I heard loud noise on a bus - surprise surprise - was when I saw a group of Indians seated close to each other. They looked like they were all in their 20s - possibly college students - all of them looked like they were from an educated background. \n\nThey were a group of 5 or 6 individuals (mixed genders) and all were seated across each other (on opposite seats in the bus) and they were talking and laughing so loudly that you could hear everything at the ground floor of the double-decker bus. Yes, it was THAT loud.\n\nAlso the first time I saw people not using the proper zebra crossing or littering was when I was in a location called \"Little India\" in Singapore. That was the first time I saw litter on the grass (people had thrown few plastic cups on the grass). I also saw some people there crossing without using the zebra crossing (I had never seen that in any other part of Singapore).\n\nI sometimes hesitate to reveal my nationality when I am in an international setting because foreigners generally have a poor opinion of Indians based on certain stereotypes and experiences and unfortunately some of those stereotypes are reinforced by idiots in our country. The problem in our country is we have never really given importance to education - our current idea of education is just rote-learning - which is memorising useless trivia just to pass exams. We don't really teach people how to be adults, how to live a good life, how to treat people or what is virtue.

{"text": "First of all, there is no awareness among us that Indian food smells are strong and stick, across the Indian population and also no awareness that this is socially unacceptable outside of homeland. Also, we have a habit of cooking only after showering and dressing up, since we consider food as very sacred and stuff. that oil with strong smell and flavor of all the spices(including ground masalas and ginger garlic, hing) stay on skin and clothes. and we go out with those clothes which we cooked in. Even the garlic that we use heavily in cooking, it makes sweat so stinky. That smell can be felt at least for 2-3 mins after we walked past a place. since we are desensitized to that smell after cooking, we do not even realize we smell, and even if we do, we have no awareness that it is socially unacceptable. also all our walls(wooden walls) get seeped in with Indian curry smell that UK landlords refused renting out to indians because no one could stay in those apartments or houses after indians no matter how much painting or odor control they do. That is how powerful the smell is. If someone is making biryani, you could smell it many houses down the street in homeland too with 100 other dishes smell during lunch time while walking. Imagine how powerful the smell can be in closed environments in other countries where everything is closed and have no fresh air coming in from anywhere(only hvac circulation because of temperatures in other countries - either too cold or too hot). Whereas in India, we keep doors and windows of homes open almost all day long so there is always free circulation.  \n  \nAlso, we have all bedroom doors in the home open all the times(not the doors which lead to outside, only the room doors and stuff). That smell spreads everywhere and settles even on fresh clothes, towels, undergarments and bedsheets and everywhere possible. Anytime i visit any Indian friend's place, i do smell a strong curry smell, like it is called, which is just the smell from all the minute oil droplets from all the spices sticking everywhere in the home.\n\nFew of the things that can help(not exhaustive but every small thing helps, since you asked)-   \n\\- Shower only after cooking and just before leaving.  \n\\- Wear only fresh clothes just before going out and not used ones already(jeans and stuff are fine but nothing that even remotely touches sweat(a lot of places that produce sweat in upper body).  \n\\- Keep Closets or wardrobes or almaras closed all the time.  \n\\- I close all the bedroom doors in home when cooking.  \n\\- Have exhausts running specifically when cooking wherever they are(no matter if they are in bathroom too i keep them on)  \n\\- Laundry washing, drying, folding only when the house is not cooked in for a while. or absolutely no smell.  \n\\- Have an odor absorber in closet  \n\\- Use antiperspirant as soon you shower and before even getting a drop of sweat and not after getting sweat as then, it is of no help at all.  \n\\- Use a complimenting perfume/cologne.  \n\\- Brush before going out in general but specifically just before leaving flights/trains wherever you think you will be in close quarters with someone.\n\nI also had experience where an indian uber guy picked me up and I sat behind the driver's seat almost in the middle of the back seat. the air from the AC was coming from the front to the back grazing through his arm/body and everytime his hand moved i could smell the strong scent/stench from his armpits or i dont know where and couldnt breathe at all. it wasnt even summer then.\n\nI am sharing the info that i have gathered over the years with hope that it might help someone. I have gotten a few complements from uber drivers, other passengers in flights and coworkers too(some backhanded and racial though like - \"ohh you smell nice, not like others\\[indians\\]\"). A cab driver directly told me i smelled nice and he had a ton of people who smelled very bad and are mostly indian so much so that that he had to open the window as soon as he knew he was picking up an indian passenger(he was not indian).", "label": 0}

The level of societal illetracy has gone off the roof. Children are being taught to break the rules to make their way. Eg: Parent will break redlights or drive reckleessly to drop their kids to schhool in Delhi while the children are learning traffic rules in School. Kids will be taught to push their way in at hospitalls, stations,malls, any setting where theres a waiting queue. I dont know about other regions in Asia but the behaviour of our people in the recent years has truly represented the \"third world\" entitlement.  The chefs kiss on top of it all is we are closed to feedback, constructtive criticism is seen as oppression or offense. This is also reflected in workplaces.

No body has any qualms about the strong dominating and maximizing their benefit at the cost of the weak. This seems to have ingrained itself in such a way that it has overpowered ethics and concept of fair play and common good. Now before people start attacking me, remember I am talking about hindu society and not religion. As you move out towards the extremities of India, you see these a differing sense of civic culture arising. Case in point some parts of the North East, Kerala, Ladakh etc. Where this overlaps with difference in religion, the differences become more marked. Conversely, the strongest form of these behaviours are undoubtedly seen in the North. \n\nTherefore, increase in income, spending power, so called \"education\" etc will only strengthen this problem of the ugly Indian because he has just become more \"successful\" and feels that he is \"in\" on a winning strategy and does not see any need to change it. \n\nWe can change this only if we diagnose the problem correctly.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Haha! Here I wouldn't agree with you. The company where I work itself has a very good culture. My friends are also working with companies where the culture is good.\nThe thing is people who have no hobbies they work for longer hours and set wrong example. Due to this the expectations from others also change. Managers want everyone to invest infinite time to their work. But this only happens where HR policies are not strong. For example, I have a team member who work from home, he lives with his parents. He works till 2AM in the night and starts at 9 AM in the morning. In our team nobody encourages this behaviour of his. Just because he doesn't have any hobbies, or doesn't know how to engage himself with other tasks he chooses to work. This is not others problem. Even our manager doesn't encourage this working style.

You could do what China did, but that must be a red line for anyone who even remotely respects human rights. You can't just force sterilisations and abortions on people.\n\n2) You may disagree on this, but I believe it is incredibly immoral for the government to decide and enforce how many children someone is permitted to have\n\n3) If you ignore all of this, what will you do to the 3rd child? Or to the couple that has the third child? Cut off access to government jobs and schemes like rajasthan did? Or deny them some necessary service/government resource? Essentially, any punitive measures will make them worse off than would otherwise be without the child. We have extensive data to suggest people have fewer children as they get richer, plunging them into dire situations and cutting off access to government support (which is already only something that the poor depend on) is just plain counterproductive.\n\n4) Won't go into economic reasons cause I'm not particularly sure about them, but you can look it up. Afaik, it was something along the lines of productive systems requiring a constantly growing productive population.\n\n5) we don't need a one or two child policy simply because India's TFR is already at the replacement level and will automatically fall under replacement level.

{"text": "This comment sort of subtly highlights the problem: We are obsessed with economic growth and external appearances for self gratification above all. We\u2019ve prostituted our values away for the sake of self-centred materialism and convenience. GDP means nothing. Does not matter if India becomes an x trillion dollar economy- that\u2019s just a derivative of how much we\u2019re consuming and that\u2019s a flawed system. Some comments below and above spoke about civic sense- that\u2019s key. Education does not equal culture, consideration and class. People can be filthy rich but still be degenerates. Our politicians are prime example of this. \nThe words from my school principal ring truer than ever: \u201cwhat we do in school is not just give you an education. We build character. What happens in our schools is a sample set for our nation at large.\u201d\n\nI agree with that. I\u2019ve worked as a teacher in a government school and fuck me, it is appalling. No wonder they do not break out of the cycle of poverty. Furthermore, literacy and the very definition of it in our country is a joke. \n\nNow, I studied in a catholic ICSE school, so I also recognise that my upbringing and narrative was largely shaped by this and so I learned better civic sense compared to >95% of Indians who did not have access to the same education as I did. But that\u2019s where it does begin, but does not end, because one does not need to go to a great school to learn civic sense and consideration for others. I recently came back in a cab from Mumbai and I connected with the cab driver so much more than I\u2019d with a lot of other educated folks- this guy had character and his words and thoughts highlighted that he thought deeply for the well being of others, not just himself. How is it that he was such a nice fellow who was considerate about others, while many \u201ceducated\u201d folks aren\u2019t?\n\nGiving nasty looks, premature judgement based on what people wear, do and think, and how they lead their lives, intrusion of the personal space to the point of making people absolutely uncomfortable\u2026 man we could go on and on. \n\nBut it does come back to the root of the issue. We\u2019re a nation today obsessed with ourselves and are living in echo chambers. I recently thought about this: In India, if a person is wealthy and powerful, the person could fuck up in most ways possible and be forgiven for it or expect to be pardoned and get away with it. After all, \u201ctu jaanta nahi mera baap kaun hain!?\u201d I read about the Nitish Katara murder case this morning and how those political goons fucks his life over. And I was like, \u201cnope. They aren\u2019t my people. The Indian pledge is a joke. I\u2019d be ashamed to call these people my own.\u201d", "label": 0}

I had shared all my shortcomings with my ex wife on the very first day and she was okay with it however after marriage she started behaving differently and not just with me but with my parents as well which eventually become one of the critical reason for the divorce. Honestly I felt cheated by her because I had shared everything with her on very first day and she said she is the same person and is okay with it. I would have expected her to be honest with her feeling and if that would have been the case I may not have move ahead with the marriage as well. \n\nAnyways thank you for your suggestion will surely work on it", "label": 0}
