Even when their movies and TV shows have low budgets their creativity is insane, both stylistically and narratively. Hell, even their reality TV is great.  \n\nWhen people sometimes recommend me Japanese stuff like the live action Rurouni Kenshin movies or Kamen Rider TV shows, I look at them and I'm like \"am I crazy or is this shit actual garbage?\".  \n\nOh well, they're still the best when it comes to animation at least.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">\u00a0\"aimed at kids\" doesn't make it above criticism.\n\nDepending on the age demographic of a kids' show, yes, it absolutely matters who the target audience is. Some movies and shows might be aimed at kids but are designed for a wider audience to enjoy. For example, a five-year-old can watch *Paw Patrol* and have a blast, but a 25-year-old is likely going to be bored out of their mind\u2014because it\u2019s *Paw Patrol*. It\u2019s for toddlers.\n\nNow, take something like *Toy Story*, *The Wild Robot*, or *Inside Out 2*. These are also aimed at kids, but they\u2019re what we call \u201cfamily movies\u201d\u2014meant to be enjoyed by everyone. A five-year-old can watch *Inside Out 2* and enjoy it on a surface level, while a 16-year-old might connect with the main character\u2019s struggles, especially with anxiety being the antagonist. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old can watch *Inside Out 2* and find meaning in its messages about mental health. Family films have layers that offer a deeper meaning or message, something that might go over a young child\u2019s head but will resonate with older kids, teens, and adults.\n\nTake *The Wild Robot* as another example. On the surface, it\u2019s about a robot, but dig deeper, and it\u2019s a story about motherhood, adoption, and learning to let go\u2014complex themes that hit differently as you get older. A toddler might just see a cute robot story, but older viewers will appreciate the broader message.\n\nIn contrast, *Paw Patrol* and *Bluey* are specifically made for toddlers; there\u2019s no hidden depth, no profound message that kids might miss. Want to know if *Paw Patrol* is \u201cgood\u201d? Ask these questions: Is it fun and exciting? Do kids enjoy watching it? Does it teach good messages? Are the characters positive role models? If the answers are \u201cyes,\u201d then it\u2019s a good show *for its intended audience*. No need to overthink it.", "label": 0}

It\u2019s a fun, exciting show that kids enjoy, plain and simple. And clearly, children like *Paw Patrol* a lot; it\u2019s been on longer than *Bluey* and even had two theatrical movies. Kids love it\u2014maybe even more than *Bluey*\u2014and that\u2019s the point.\n\nI\u2019m not saying *Bluey* is a bad show, but *Paw Patrol* and *Bluey* are essentially the same in purpose. I can\u2019t sit down and genuinely enjoy either, and I don\u2019t go around calling *Paw Patrol* \u201cbad,\u201d because, again, it\u2019s a kids\u2019 show. Do the kids enjoy it? If yes, then what\u2019s the problem? Why trash something they like just because it\u2019s \u201cnot for you\u201d? It was never meant for adults to critique.\n\nAnd if your issue with *Paw Patrol* is that it features \u201cunderage dogs as first responders,\u201d then, by that logic, *Teen Titans* should also be \u201cbad\u201d because it\u2019s about underage kids fighting supervillains and living alone in a tower funded by adults.

No. The side characters weren\u2019t the most memorable (Zip could be a little annoying at times), the villain was\u2026 alright, and maybe the story could have been stronger. But I\u2019m pretty sure Crystal Dynamics is trying to bridge the gap between survivalist Lara and badass treasure Hunter Lara, and I think this is a step in the right direction. I liked the action scenes more than some, and I associate the older Tomb Raider with the action more than the plot. Dang it, sometimes you just want some fun action scenes, and for me, the show delivered. If you go into the show with the mindset of just wanting to have some fun, I think it helps. Plus, I really liked Hayley Atwell\u2019s performance as Lara. You could tell she was having fun with it.

She couldn\u2019t even lean on her prosecutorial background for obvious reasons. She moved left but obviously she butted up against Bernie + co and wasn\u2019t really authentic self. Just a terrible time for her and I think her campaign staff were just bad at her job. I don\u2019t think democratic people disliked but liked others more\n\n2) oh his age was for sure a risk. But come on he wasn\u2019t tenth as bad as he was this time last year. The reasons for why Biden ran again were simple. Incumbents usually have an advantage, the economy was on an upward trajectory.  \n\n3) infighting for an incumbent candidate is a death sentence. Theres huge risk he just didn\u2019t step down and dems autolose. Also again the decision to do that would really need to be made right after the midterms. You can\u2019t just have a backup campaign ready to go. Too many people, 100% would have leaked then it becomes super hurtful. But again Biden was completely fine in 2022 especially after a good election for dems\n\n4) it\u2019s literally tied in the polls. MOE is 4pts for most polls. She could literally win all the battleground states. Vibes mean nothing just as they did in 2022\n\n5) if you think any other dem candidate, would add more than a point.

This is why the original PS era Lara and the Netflix Lara are totally different characters.

IDK, I have watched all rhe Marvel stuff, don\u2019t approach them like they all are the same (nor do I want them to be) but something about this one is just off for me.
