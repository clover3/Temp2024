Kids of every color are fucking stupid, but oftentimes kids that aren\u2019t white will have something non-violent perceived as violent or escalate to that point because they aren\u2019t afforded the same leeway as white kids. \n\nAnd what comes with that is a vicious cycle. White people thought people of other ethnicities and cultures, so they got accused of crimes they didn\u2019t commit, like that 14 year old that was put in the electric chair, even though years later it came out he was innocent. Or even actually committing crimes due to necessity. If you need to steal bread to feed your family, you\u2019re going to do that. When people\u2019s parents are imprisoned wrongfully, you learn to be wary of the people who imprisoned them. Then the people who imprisoned your parents become suspicious of you because you\u2019re suspicious of them. And this keeps going on for generations.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s something that has to start with those who hold more power extending an olive branch more often, and not jumping to conclusions.
