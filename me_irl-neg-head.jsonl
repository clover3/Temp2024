After a few interactions I guess they see that nothing\u2019s working, I\u2019m just staring them down, and they start trying to act cool towards me. Despite being a pacifist and walking on a cane, I somehow managed to give off the aura that if you make me snap I\u2019d absolutely fuck someone up. I don\u2019t know why me staring people down makes them scared, I think despite my soft face, I inherited my dad\u2019s intimidating expressions and that mixed with my silence makes me way more unpredictable and intimidating than I prefer, but it\u2019s good bully repellent.\n\nJust wished it worked on my toxic dad, apparently it worked one time when he threatened to throw the iPad I bought in the pool.
