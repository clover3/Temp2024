So the argument about his food , his decision is right in the sense , that of course the food is owned by the person and he decides who to give it to , but he then has no right to occupy the public space illegally and can be asked to move away that's all. The argument about food vendors doesn't defend the point either , those are illegal and can be removed whenever the govt wants to do so.   \nAgain there is a difference in a person doing it , and a govt official at duty doing something , there is some authority that comes with a govt duty especially like that of a police officer.   \nGeneralization is ofcourse bad , but when these are not handful occurences and are more common than you think I can scourge more such news articles if you want.   \nAgain if a pattern is observed , that muslims from Kerala are joining ISIS , then the problem must be resolved , similar goes for incidents of such kind.

If the lady required food for survival, it would not bother what she was asked to say. The closest analogy is that for the poor people, it does not matter what govt comes into power, what matters is the benefit given by the said government. Give them adequate benefits and they would be happy to change their religious stance in a snap of your fingers.\n\nIf the lady wanted food, they could have asked her to even say that optimus prime is our lord and saviour and she would have said so, for it would not have made a difference to her.\n\nLastly, it was the man's food, sponsored by him, organised by him. He has the right to deny the service to the ones he doesn't like and to give food to the ones he would like to give. That's like a random nobody filing a case against SRK for saying he didn't feed him anything. Is he obligated to feed you.

All the Hindus in comment section against uncle's deed are fake Hindus with fake I'd or who don't know about the religion , hinduism is the most cruel religion of all in whole planet , Bali pratha is the only way to get blessings of devi , also even ravan gave Bali of himself that too 9 times o get a meeting with God Brahma , God Rudra killed his father in law , his Son , God yama , God kamadeva etc. God Vishnu too is cruel , as Shri Krishna avatar he killed many rakshas , his maternal uncle and made Arjun killed half of then population of world also ,he killed the body of bhagwaan khatu shayam or barbarik who was only 14, only to gave Hindus of kaliyug the will to fight and be cruel not polite as hell .Hanumaan ji the most worshipped hindu God killed every next female , like sursa , lankini , who have read tulsidas shriRamcharitmanas will know . How Hindus became  so soft and polite is due to ShriRam and ramayana cause ShriRam was the most polite loving God , so Hindus gurus and parents , political figures , religious figures made Hindus weak . Hindus should again start worshipping the cruel God's and rekindle the love with our roots , being cruel is the only way sustain in this country or else it will not take time to become Bangladesh or Pakistan.

{"text": "Pigeons are doves. They are rock doves, and I wonder if we began to call them that if people would hesitate to hate them, as doves have that history as messengers of peace. It is true that in my neighborhood nobody hates the mourning doves, dusky and elegant with wings that squeak as if they flap on rusty hinges. They roost on the wires like little Audrey Hepburns, while the pigeons troll the ground, tough and fat, some of them look like they should be smoking cigarettes. They look poor and banged up, like they could kick the mourning doves\u2019 asses but are wise to the divide-and-conquer tactics we use on one another, so they coo wearily at the mourning doves and waddle forth in search of scavenged delights. What you may not know is when you call a pigeon \u201ca rat with wings\u201d you have given it a compliment. The only thing a rat lacks is a pair of wings to lift it, so you have named the pigeon perfectly. When you say to me, \u201cI hate pigeons,\u201d I want to ask you who else you hate. It makes me suspicious. \n\nI once met a girl who was so proud to have hit such a bird on her bicycle, I swear, I thought that it was me she hit. I felt her handlebars in my stomach and now it is your job to feel it also. The pigeons are birds, they are doves. They are the nature of the city and the ones who no one loves. When people say they hate pigeons, I want to ask them if they hate themselves, too. Does it prick the well of your loathing? Do they make you feel dirty and ashamed? Are you embarrassed about how little or how much you have, for how you have had to hustle? Being dirty is not a problem for the pigeon. You can ask it, \u201cHow do you feel about having the city coating your feathers, having the streets gunked up in the crease of your eye?\u201d and the pigeon would say, \u201cNot a problem.\u201d You will now stop blaming the pigeon. It is not the pigeon\u2019s fault. The pigeon was once a dove, and then we built our filthy empire up around it, came to hate it for simply thriving in the midst our decay, came to hate it for not dying. The pigeon is your ally. They are chameleons, gray as the concrete they troll for scraps, at night they huddle and sing like cats. Their necks are glistening, iridescent as an oil-slick rainbow, they mate for life, and they fly.\n\nMichelle Tea, Against Memoir.", "label": 1}

I say you have the worst blinders being there because you have been passed down cultural broken telephones through time. We in Canada have a different insight than being in the mess. The insight is not a superior perspective it's an alternate reasoning to your deep rooted problem. The world is too global and open for you to say \"you don't love in Punjab, you don't know what happens here\". Bro we know and we know hard what the BJP is doing, education doesn't breed elitism, it breeds awareness and that sometimes is depressing. \n\nLook I sympathize with you about the perils of developing countries and developed countries. I understand how hard deep seeded multi-millenia has caused massive problems that are hard to change. Palestine-Israel is a great example of this. So for all the rooted problems, I bow my head because that's just unfair. \n\nFor 1000 years you complain \"India will never change, it's not a developed nation\", when we tell you the religious institutions are ruining the country you don't believe. You just Bhajao your drums harder to religion. Not saying \"developed\" worlds don't have problems, but highly different issues. And electing the Modi and supporting a Hindu nationalism is like the worst thing you can do to unite a fragmented nation. \n\nIndia has such power as a subcontinent and can rule the world but unfortunately BJP and Hindu nationalism divides the people not elevates them. When India has a leader that united all Indians and NRIs globally, India will enter a new age. Until then each religion will do this wherever they go. \n\nStop breeding money launderes for tuition, honestly I'm on your side there. These stupid liberals sold the country to the Educational Institutions and now they resevered it as of last week. Now all these schools are struggling. You see in Canada Change fucking happens. In India, same thing comes up, all the ministers point to each other and it goes in circles. We are watching all the scandals. Again, let's use the developed vs developing country narrative only when India lacks moral judge od character (it's an easy out).\n\nProtest and freedom of speech is one thing, calling for assassination as bad as it is, is one thing. Let me tell you there is no calling or protest, in India that murder just happens. Btw anyone burning Canadian flags get arrested, and recently a Pro Palestine group went \"too far\" on freedom of speech and they made them a terrorist group the next day. Once again Immediate Change, when is that change happening in India? 200 years after the pundits, the politicians, their kids and all the corrupt police get paid off. \n\nI'm sorry, I understand developing countries are hard and institutions aren't set up to protect a social contract that society can upload.

I am sure most of the violent cases are done by hindu too or any other community, but the difference is intention: Religious intent: purely criminal intent.\n\nNow some one will say modi bhakt andh bhakt gobarvaadi yada yada. I live by the idea of bharat aka india. I criticize modi when i see fault or yogi when i see one(when yogi made a some comment about doing the same if hindu women were harmed). See the intent. \n\nOver the centuries One community has been ravaging raping or playing victim card using their religion, its happening all over the world btw not just india. Some people will say oh forget the past before british came and what not... wtf why 90-95%of states of muslim community demanded for separate nation and then stayed back in india?? why? do you really want us to believe that you wont do it again when the there are numerous examples of soemone saying 15min ke lie police hata do.... Making vulgar comment on sita mata, making false copies of bhagvata geeta. I can go on and on. When the same is done as a resistance you will play victim card??? huh..\n\nIf you really wanna make us think that no Islam is not that and it should be protected then go ahead wage wars against those elements in the society make your sir tan se juda against your own community \"sir tan se juda gang\". Because anyhow its your responsibility to protect true islam isnt it? why dont you do so??\n\nAt the end any muslim who is reading this should know that no we dont hate muslim, if you give us APJ Sir, Bismillah Khan etc we will praise you and will be ready to die for you. But give us those reason. But if you praise gangster and go to their maiyaat then surely dont blame us for calling you enemy.\n\nPeace be upon you..", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is where you are missing the context of my whole passage. I have no problem with muslim as i said earlier. i could give an example but i didnt earlier. You said how should you be treated? Of course you will be treated nicely even though if you were a muslim. I repeat even though if you were a muslim. I am against the people below who comments \"oh i face this thing everyday for being muslim\" dont blame us. Increase in the certain crimes in the name of islam made you target so you should blame your mullahs etc. For example almost every one dont wanna get along with bihari does that mean they are bad people ? but surely they are mostly associated with crimes? thats the idea people have based on past incidents. I always tell people that biharis are most intelligent people in india.\n\nNow you said muslim kill muslim. Again the intention bro the intention. All i am talking about is intention. dont miss the point.\n\nYou said hindus discard other ideologies . No they dont. I have never met anyone who had any enmity towards other jain or what not community. My friend was jain we never had any problem. I being a hindu go to jain temple or any other temple.\n\nYou said come together as one. thats what i have been saying,,,, sure most people will agree. BUT could take the responsibility in every step to face your own community and tell them dont kill dont do sir tan se judaa and all those things? can you be the one to protect from those ridiculous so called mullah asking for conversion and the beings who says 15min ke police hata do ... and he did it again recently btw..", "label": 1}
