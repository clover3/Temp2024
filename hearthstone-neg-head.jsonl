Winning more consistently means higher rank. You're going to see less variety the higher you go and that's true for most competitive environments.

Dragon Priest only got two dragons, and zero in any set after. Undead got support before it rotated and then again for Demon Hunter cross-cards. Overheal didn't get any since the overhaul, and it is now getting some in Dark Beyond. Highlander has not gotten any direct support since Badlands. Automation has not gotten any support since it came out. They need to have a concise direction for Priest. Stop trying to force aggro. \n\n2) A hero power rework. The absolute most dog-shit hero power out there. It needs to be heal 4, as there's 1 mana discover paired with heal 3-5. Or apply the \"if undamaged. gains +1 HP\" Therefore, Priest would have an actual turn-two play. While Warrior can get +2HP Priest can only pass if they have no cards to play. \n\n3) Stop being afraid of giving Priest control cards. This is what people tend to love about Priest.

{"text": "Your suggestions on balance. The pictures with changes. All suggest buffs to cards on a lower power or nerfs to cards on a higher power to bring everything up to about where cards are for other classes. While this is great and should be a standard by now. This doesn't help fix the issue of identity. You actually are taking away identity from Priest in its thief mechanic which you also list as unique to Priest while Rogue can do this and has for about the same time or longer. \n\nI don't think a huge overhaul on current cards is what Priest needs. I believe that they need a Hero Power rework and a direct design. Buffing pieces for all sets/random sets just puts us back to a mashup of random components from all over to build a deck with decently stated minions. Which would mean something like Highlander since all other playstyles would be too weak on their own. \n\nCompare the highlander package for Warrior, the taunt package for Druid, big spells for Mage package, Excavate for Deathknight. They all have a clear gameplan with cards to all help push their design goal. The only thing buffing a card here or there from all current cards does is help in making the cards \"feel better\" to play, but still does not give any direction to Priest as a class or identity. \n\nBig Priest might be the last real deck type they tried heavily to push. That or Zarmini, but then they didn't give it any new dragons going forward. For reasons? \n\nPriest needs the same treatment as other classes. Being able to build upon components that they already have and add to a deck that is good but not great. Mage got this. Druid. Warrior. Death Knight. Near every class has an identity or a way that a deck should be built or could be built around. Priest is just \"hope you play these things and survive\". There's no win-con, end game. Which you do address, but none of the changes are directing towards an overall theme besides boring the opponent to death. \n\nPersonally, I think they should play into the thief mechanic further, bring the Hero Power up to today standards (Which should have happened during the overheal change to Priest where they addressed the class), and design sets that have a clear condition or theme behind them. Automation tried, but they didn't give it support. Undead tried, but they gave it support too late. Dragon did, but then didn't give it support. The theme is them trying something and it partially working or not working at all without going back to it and give further support to the archetype. \n\n   \nTLDR: Give Priest an identity and follow-up with it. Continue to give it things that could go into said deck and strengthen it overtime like other classes (EG Big Spell Mage, Spell Druid, Highlander Warrior). Rework the Hero Power. Touch on what the identity of Priest should be and focus on that. I thought it would be Overheal when they publicly addressed it, but then didn't give the deck many tools / killed it with a balance change.", "label": 0}

I *heavily* dislike the constant ping-ponging between \u201cdifferent archetypes\u201d that seems to be the current focus of design. I would prefer that classes had an overall style that they stuck to. I don\u2019t want aggressive priest cards, no one else seems to either. Similarly, I don\u2019t want expensive cards in rogue. Etc and so on.\n\nThe changes you propose are (largely) focused on improving utility and I like this a lot. So many cards in priest are too niche *and* overly expensive. It always baffles me, for instance, that void shard is 4 mana 4 damage. That\u2019s just\u2026 did they even want this card to ever get used? Like seriously? It doesn\u2019t even remove a lot of 4 drops.\n\nLike you, I want priest to be priest. I don\u2019t want to flood the board and rely on neutrals + Aman-Thul. I want to control-burn, or control-value. Judging by the amount of times I face priest, I don\u2019t think anyone else likes these aggressive decks either. I look at this new expansion and sigh, because it\u2019s yet another uninteresting set of cards that don\u2019t give me what I want. This isn\u2019t limited to priest, but I play priest 90% of the time.

{"text": "I see, I was taking a myopic view.\n\nZarimi is kinda a good example of the design itself being wrong. Dragon Priest is already an okay if unpopular deck, giving it more support may push it over the edge. But taking a step back, they should've never printed cheap dragons with Zarimi because by doing so, they're in a design deadend. Instead by only having midrange and expensive dragons, there would be design space to actually support the archetype as a control / midrange deck with a finisher instead of only as an aggro deck.\n\nYearh, I suppose the bigger problem is that the other classes have some fairly obvious natural synergy like Druid has expensive cards which pair well with ramping which pairs well with card draw so a lot of stuff just natrually works together. Or Warrior has armor gain, which pairs well with suriving to expensive late game win cons, which then turn the survival tools in reach e.g. Doctor Boom or Sleep under the Stars. In contrast, Priest has removal but no late game to pair with it. Priest as aggro but minimal reach. Priest has big stats but no reload. So, the archetypes are highly reliant on draw RNG.\n\nTo be honest, Thief archetypes are my favorite archetype in card games.

{"text": "You don\u2019t understand Hearthstone? Let me break it down for you, because what most people think is just a \u2018card game\u2019 is so much more than that. Hearthstone is an intricate dance, a blend of strategy, luck, and skill that rivals even the most intense games out there. Every match is a story of wits and mind games, each card a unique character in the story, and every deck a representation of the player\u2019s understanding of the meta, of their own playstyle, and even of psychology. You think RNG is everything? Sure, it plays a role, but a true Hearthstone player knows how to control the odds\u2014or at least knows how to adapt when the odds turn against them. Because if you think you can just hop in, build a deck, and expect to win, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people spend countless hours refining their decks, experimenting with combos, and memorizing every single card in the game. Every spell, every creature, every hero power\u2014these are tools that a master can use to forge victory from seemingly impossible situations. You want to talk about RNG? Fine, let\u2019s talk about RNG. Yes, you might get lucky or unlucky with your draws, but the real pros don\u2019t blame RNG; they embrace it. They know that Hearthstone is about mitigating randomness, understanding the odds, and playing the percentages. A great player sees beyond the next draw. They think multiple turns ahead, considering every possible move, and planning for every possible response. And you know what? Even when things go horribly wrong, they adapt, they recover, they find a way to turn the tide back in their favor.\n\nWhen you see that top player with an unbroken win streak, it\u2019s not just luck. It\u2019s a combination of deep knowledge of the meta, an intimate understanding of card synergies, and a sixth sense for reading their opponent. These are players who can look at your opening hand and know within moments what deck you\u2019re playing and how to counter it. They\u2019ve got it down to a science. But the real beauty of Hearthstone isn\u2019t just in the calculations; it\u2019s in the psychology. This isn\u2019t just math\u2014this is poker, this is chess, this is warfare. A skilled player can bluff, bait, and psychologically break their opponent long before they ever hit zero health. That\u2019s the real game beneath the game: it\u2019s a duel of wits, where one player subtly controls the other, leading them into traps, making them second-guess their moves, and forcing them into making mistakes.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the art of building a deck, because you can\u2019t just throw powerful cards together and hope it works. Every card in a deck has to serve a purpose. You need to understand your win conditions, your card draw, your tempo, your board control. Are you running aggro, control, combo, or midrange? Each of these archetypes is an entirely different beast, with its own strengths, weaknesses, and optimal play patterns. The best players understand not just their deck but every popular deck in the meta. They know the counters, the weaknesses, the strengths, and the ideal responses for every matchup. You can bet that if a pro is running a deck, they've put hours into fine-tuning every single card, testing every possible combo, and perfecting their mulligan strategy.\n\nEven beyond all the gameplay mechanics, Hearthstone is more than just a game\u2014it\u2019s a community. People argue about balance, cheer for their favorite streamers, analyze every patch note, and create memes about every single change. There\u2019s a deep sense of camaraderie and rivalry in the Hearthstone world. People invest their time and energy not just in playing but in discussing, debating, and analyzing the game in ways you wouldn't believe. They follow the competitive scene, they watch tournaments, they have opinions on every deck, every patch, every nerf and buff. They study every patch note and balance change, debating how it affects the meta and wondering which archetypes will rise or fall. And the thing is, Hearthstone keeps evolving. New cards, new expansions, new mechanics\u2014it never stops. This constant change is what keeps the game fresh, what keeps players on their toes. Every time a new expansion drops, it\u2019s like a wave crashing through the game, reshuffling the tier list and redefining the meta. Players adapt, find new strategies, and develop new decks to rise to the top once again.\n\nSo yeah, Hearthstone may look like a simple card game, but anyone who actually understands it knows that it's so much more. It\u2019s a strategic battlefield, a mental gauntlet, and a canvas for creativity, all rolled into one. It\u2019s a game that challenges not just your knowledge of cards but your ability to think ahead, adapt on the fly, and stay calm under pressure. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to understand the deeper layers of Hearthstone, if you\u2019ve put in the hours, suffered the losses, celebrated the wins, then you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Hearthstone is a masterpiece, a symphony of tactics and strategy, and if you\u2019re not ready to respect the game, then it\u2019s going to chew you up and spit you out. Because Hearthstone isn\u2019t just about who has the best cards. It\u2019s about who has the skills, the patience, and the guts to come out on top in a game where anything can happen at any moment.\n\nSo if you\u2019re still calling it \u2018just a card game,\u2019 I\u2019d invite you to sit down, build a deck, and try your hand against someone who\u2019s been here since the beginning. See how long you last. Because Hearthstone isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s an art form, a science, a test of patience, and a journey of endless discovery. And only the best can truly say they understand it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you\u2019re watching this tape, I\u2019m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn\u2019t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn\u2019t know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \u201chit\u201d on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I\u2019m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can\u2019t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "label": 0}

{"text": "TL:DR:\nFavourite is probably hero powers and new hero powers, least favourite is random effects where there is a very large power difference between a low roll and a high roll.\n\nI agree that discover and dredge are excellent as some others said, but I think my personal favourites are some hero cards, and some of the quests and sidequests.\n\nSome of the quests and hero cards have certainly been quite unfun to deal with, but I really like the deck building challenge quests can pose. The thing I really like about hero cards is in how they play with the hero portraits and hero power mechanics.\n\n Honestly hero powers on their own is a really neat mechanic, if you include new hero powers it might even be my favourite. It really helps make every class feel more destinct, and makes bad turns feel a lot less terrible. Because just a hero power rarely feels good, but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing at all.\n\nSomeone mentioned not liking rest of game effects because you can't really play around them, which I certainly agree with to some degree, but that is also what I really like about some quests and hero cards. The key word there being some.\n\nI think that a permanent effect that either wins you the game in a couple of turns at most is fine, and that ones that only give you a very slight edge that very well might not be that decisive for most of the time that it's active can be pretty great (for example some new hero powers, and what little experience I've had playing against the dk card that gives permanent +1 attack). However a permanent effect that will almost undoubtedly win the game eventually, but takes a long time to do so is absolutely dreadful to play against. Except for maybe some hand/deck buff stuff and old c'thun, but that's not really a permanent effect in the same way I don't think (although that might just be because I like those types of decks).\n\nBut my absolute least favourite is random targeting, and some forms of completely random generation. A random frost spell, or a random spell that costs 3 or less, or five or more, or a random excavated card, or something like that is pretty fine, but if a card can give you anything from a one mana spell to a tsunami the distance between the high and low rolls is too large.\n\nSomething like deal 3 damage to two random minions can be fine, but things like mad bomber and arcane missiles that can either do nothing, win you the game or lose you the game with relatively little chance to manipulate it (ok, those aren't the best examples because they're such small effects).\n\nBasically I really dislike random effects that have a too large variance in their effectiveness. It's fine when there are low rolls and high rolls as long as the average outcome is still within the same ballpark. If randomness is the difference between a good play and a great play or getting a good resource or a great resource then that's fine. But if a random effect will make something either a great play or a terrible play I think that it detracts from the strategic experience that I'm looking for in this type of game.\n\n(This comment became really lomg, huh)", "label": 0}

While I prefer to \"mutilate\" my account for dust, I've also kept cards from classes I don't play that often post a rotation.

I do possess it and I still disagree.\n\n>I\u2019m also 100% sure that I\u2019ve played on at least one of my accounts with a similar or lower engagement level than you on yours, and I know for a fact I didn\u2019t need to main a class.\n\nGood for you. But perhaps you don't play the game the same way I do. Perhaps you don't want to try out dumb strategies that waste a ton of unnecessary dust.

I want every card of the classes I play, I can only get that in 3 ways: Either I buy enough packs to do so, gold and/or real money; either I am lucky and get the most expensive ones and craft the rest; or I dust cards I don't want and craft it.\n\n>Sure, I would have bias towards a class, but I also noticed that a lot of the decks I played on those accounts were the same decks I would have made on my main account\n\nWell good for you, for me that doesn't happen.

The real evidence though is that a lot of the pixel art that Trey has posted has a lot of suspiciously ai errors that basically no professional pixel artist at that level would ever make(Inconsistent number of fingers on each hand, inconsistent alignments, impossible positioning, etc.). \n\nOverall, its pretty clear that at the very least some other works of Trey Fore were ai-generated, and while there's no conclusive evidence that the ones specifically commisioned by Blizzard were ai-generated, the fact that there is no evidence of Trey Fore actually having a history as a pixel artist likely means that all of Trey's works, including the ones commisioned by Blizzard, are ai-generated.

{"text": "And yet we see a lot of people not using AI to achieve good results, just \"good enough\" which is a different thing. I do agree that prompts themselves are skillfull and might even develop as an artform themselves because thats where expression lies.\n\n\nPictures achieve a different role than portraits. At most people use portrait pictures as profile pictures or similar. Pictures you hang around your house tend to be family and moment focused, something painters couldn't truly achieve on the same level as the skillset lies elsewhere. Pictures became a new thing.\n\n\nI know art will not die regardless of the AI onslaught. As long as one kid is doodling in a notebook then art is alive. However, the commodification and mass production of static images does cheapen and dilute the medium and delivers a heavy blow to art itself. On a game like these, if the card artists were hypothetically gone, who's next? Music, sound, VFX, card designers?", "label": 0}

The first one goes wherever and doesn't matter. The second has to be directly before after the first card (2 spots), the third has 3 spots it can go, and the last has 4 spots.

{"text": "I would wait on the standard packs and catch up packs until the new expansion is out.
