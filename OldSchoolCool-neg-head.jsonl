The change from manually drawing on a board to 2d drawing on a computer did save time, neaten things up (my hand lettering was atrocious), and made our designs more standardized (copying bits and pieces from previous or other designs saved the designer time, so that's what us lazy (I mean smart) people did). The change from computerized 2d to solid modeling (3d) was the real game changer in so many ways. Easier to check fits and movements, easier to do stress analysis, easier to show designs to non-technical people, easier to communicate with suppliers and customers, easier to make tooling or program manufacturing machines. One small example, back when we were doing hand drawings or even 2d CAD drawings the Engineering Department had a line item in the yearly budget for Fedex-ing drawings. Sending a drawing required someone to make a copy of the drawing (perhaps on the blueprint machine), fold it, stuff it in an envelope, type an address label, and get it to shipping/receiving. That said, I still have a drafting table and more m3chanical pencils than I ever did when I was actually in a board for work, because it feels good, satisfying, and even artistic.", "label": 0}
