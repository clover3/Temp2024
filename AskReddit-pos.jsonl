I do not have any issues being alone.\n\nThis is where the question lies - I have been seeing this girl for some time and it looks like it is leaning towards a relationship, and as stated, I do enjoy spending time with her but the more time goes on, the more I realise that the feelings I feel like I SHOULD have in this situation just aren't there, I don't have overwhelming feelings for her, I don't have feelings of missing her when I don't see her for time on end, although I know she has a big thing for me, I don't understand why and feel she is wasting her time with me. I don't know if, because I have these feelings I am leading her on, am getting myself into a relationship doomed to fail if I feel this way already or if it's just my mind playing tricks.\n\nI'd love some advice\u00a0", "label": 1}

The cost going to school went up. The cost for the trucks and trains and ships to deliver our food, clothes and really, EVERYTHING.

When I was 26, I got sober, went to a dead end college, got a dead end degree.\n\nBut pretty much everything I did was only \"waste\" if you're dumb enough to believe there's any definite way to live, and that we all have similar abilities and challenges. I'm a neurodivergent atheist transwoman who was raised in a deeply dysfunctional, conservative, and religious family, and was bullied to a ridiculous degree. My depression? PTSD, I fit the profile by the time I was ten. I drank to keep that and the dysphoria at bay. I spent all my time lost in fantasy worlds because there was zero hope in the real one, given how pervasive homo/transphobia were, and still are. I was certain I was gonna die by 25, so why not? Might as well have some fun. And first chance I really got, I got sober, I got out, and I started unlearning all the toxic shit that had been poured into me.\n\nMy thirties have been similarly chaotic. But they're coming to a close in the next few years now too. I spent them mostly homeless, high as a kite, and traveling the US while I settled into my transition. And now I'm back in college and working to start a career that'll make up some of the lost time.\n\nMy only jobs are to survive, develop, and be a woman. I am a woman. I am alive. And I've experienced and seen shit most of you never will. So what if I don't have a career yet, or a house of my own, or kids? By my metrics, my own goals? I'm doing great.

{"text": "While I see where you're coming from, your comment simplifies a complex issue. It\u2019s true that individuals with ADHD often experience differences in dopamine regulation, which can lead to reward-seeking behaviors, including masturbation. However, framing it as merely a pursuit of dopamine misses the bigger picture.\n\nNot every person with ADHD engages in chronic masturbation, and it's important to recognize that there are various emotional and psychological factors at play. For some, it may be a coping mechanism for boredom or impulsivity, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a universal experience for all men with ADHD. Additionally, while there is a correlation between ADHD and substance use disorders, it\u2019s not a direct causation\u2014many people with ADHD do not develop problematic behaviors related to masturbation or drug use.\n\nBy generalizing the relationship between ADHD and chronic masturbation, we risk oversimplifying a nuanced condition. It\u2019s essential to consider individual differences and underlying mental health issues rather than attributing this behavior solely to dopamine. Each person's experience with ADHD is unique, and reducing it to a simplistic explanation doesn't accurately reflect the complexities of both ADHD and human behavior.", "label": 1}

One of the biggest steps was allowing myself to actually feel everything\u2014the sadness, anger, and confusion\u2014without trying to rush through it. I made an effort to spend time with friends and family, which helped me remember I wasn\u2019t alone and brought moments of joy back into my life. I also took up a new hobby, something just for me, that helped me rebuild my confidence and gave me something positive to focus on.\n\nEventually, I realized that heartbreak was just part of the journey and that healing was about rediscovering who I was outside of that relationship. It wasn\u2019t easy, but it taught me a lot about self-love and resilience.", "label": 1}

Anything the zoo wishes to keep like skulls, pelts, horns etc are also removed during this time. If it\u2019s something like a guinea pig it can be disposed of like any regular pet. If it\u2019s something very rare we have to go to a crematorium and physically watch the person operating the oven place the body parts into the oven and wait until the body parts are sufficiently burned beyond recovery for potential illegal selling. Very very large animals like an elephant are taken to remote locations where a large pit is dug, the necropsy and everything takes place within the pit and at the end it\u2019s all buried and the location is kept discreet to prevent people from digging it up. Also due to the fact that we give animals medications, vaccines, antibiotics they aren\u2019t really ever fed to other zoo animals. I have heard of it happening in European zoos but I know mine would never let that happen. We have cockroaches in education and even when we have excess we aren\u2019t allowed to feed them out because they are technically a zoo animal. We have to euthanize extra humanely.", "label": 1}

Religious Freedom is freedom for everyone, she merely does not support Christian exceptionalism. Your \"Some would argue\" needs a lot of clarification, as Christians are not under any threat of persecution at all. \n\n3. Both Candidates support Israel.

I had to pay my friend back for the train tickets, so I went to the ATM and withdrew some cash. My friend and I later went out to eat Maggie. I usually carry my wallet in my hand, I feel it safer that way. I was having trouble juggling my wallet and Maggie, so I handed it over to my friend to keep it. It was almost 7 (my hostel curfew), I asked my friend for my wallet. He said he didn\u2019t have, at first I thought he was joking around with me. Next moment I see him running around tracing all he places we had been to that evening. My wallet was lost. Since I was travelling the next day, it had my id proof, ATM card, cash (around 4 k) in it. We went back to the Maggie stall to inquire if he had seen a wallet around. Fortunately he did see a wallet, picked it up and gave it to a complete stranger. My heart fell, I was so angry at him, how could he give away my wallet. We asked him where the man went or his contact number but he spoke nothing of him only thing he remembered was the colour of his shirt. He said he didn\u2019t have his number but that man was a regular customer to his shop. We were trying our best searching for him. It was already past my curfew, I had lost all hope of finding my wallet again. My phone was ringing continuously, my friend (whom I was supposed to pay) kept calling me. I thought she was calling me to know when I was going to pay her. I kept hanging her up. Finally I did pick the call to tell her, I lost my wallet and there was no way I could pay today. Miraculously, she wasn\u2019t calling about the money, she was calling to tell me that there is a man waiting at the hostel for me to return my wallet. I had never been so happy. I felt so lucky. He refused to give my wallet to anyone other than me, he was waiting for me to come back and receive my wallet. I rushed back to the hostel.

She was funny, absolutely gorgeous, super charming and easy to talk to. I asked if she walked her dog around the area and she said she had a dog walker but she sometimes takes walks with them. Then some other lady came and basically took her away into a car and we said goodbye. I had no idea who it was, but I was just madly in love in that moment, and I turned to my sister and asked if it seemed like she was into me, and she just laughed at me.\n\nI thought I just met this beautiful amazing woman on the street and had a chance with her. My sister had to point it out to me afterwards that she Salma Hayek, who was that demon lady who sucked Quintin Tarantinos toes in dusk till dawn (my only reference point).

{"text": "The year is 2030.\n\nYou're at college out of state, a couple of hours away from home by plane. There's nothing extraordinary about you and aside from occasionally checking the News subreddit, you don't pay much attention to world affairs.\n\nIn January, you read an article about joint military exercises planned between Iran and Russia. It's boring and doesn't say much, so you ignore it and go about your day.\n\nIn April, you read another article about increased global tensions. Russia is threatening Georgia with invasion under some dubious pretense, while a new conflict has broken out between Israel and Hamas with Iran threatening to intervene. This troubles you a bit, but it's far away and doesn't affect your daily life, so you ignore it.\n\nIn May, the President convenes an emergency session of Congress to discuss possible U.S intervention in the Israel-Hamas conflict. You read a number of articles about the growing controversy and there are multiple days of national news coverage about protests in major U.S cities. \n\nIran threatens direct military action against the U.S and Russia warns the U.S that it may provide weapons and advisors if conflict occurs. China announces that it's willing to host a peace conference between the U.S and Iran, but nobody takes it seriously, especially since they're currently hinting at taking military action to expel U.S Navy ships from the waters around Taiwan.\n\nAt the end of May, all national news channels announce that Iranian missiles have struck and sunk a U.S. Navy destroyer off the coast of Israel. The President orders retaliatory attacks against Iranian personnel in Lebanon and Syria using long-range cruise missiles and drone strikes. \n\nYou watch all of this with growing alarm and talk to your friends about it. They just shrug: what are we going to do? We have midterms next week anyways. You agree and put it out of your head. \n\nThen one morning in early June, you're woken up by emergency sirens outside your dorm room. Your phone is flooded with unread messages and you can't seem to get ahold of anyone. You talk to your roommate, your RA and other dorm residents, but nobody seems to know anything about what's happened.\n\nSomeone from the administration physically travels to your dorm with a pair of uniformed police officers and gathers everyone together. They tell you not to panic, but the Federal government has declared a state of emergency. \n\nYour college is shutting down classes temporarily and all students are being sent home until further notice. International students will stay on campus under the watch of staff members, but all U.S students must pack up and prepare to leave immediately. There's a flood of panicked questions, but no answers.\n\nYou pack up and are brought to the airport by a bus borrowed from the local elementary school. The college has bought you a plane ticket home on the first flight back to your home state. \n\nYou're standing in line at the airport, anxious and wondering what's going on. All of a sudden, you see a very bright light off in the distance and then you see nothing at all, ever again. \n\nThat's what WW3 would be like.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Back when I was 10 there was a competition for schoolkids to write a treatment for an episode of Doctor Who, with the best one being developed into an full episode in the next series and the winner receiving a writing credit. I was a huge fan of DW at the time and the competition was actually run through schools, so my teacher made the entire class do it, but I was very excited.\n\nI began writing a story about the Doctor landing on a planet full of defective cybermen, who's programming had gone a wry and had been left on this asylum planet to rot. The Doctor lands there in response to a mysterious distress call from a woman and attempts to find and save her while avoiding the dangerous dysfunctional cybermen and the looming threat of planetary destruction at the hands of the normal cybermen. I finished my short treatment and gave it to my teacher to submit. Unfortunately it turned out the competition was very strict about the formatting of submissions and mine was returned because I had used the wrong formatting in some way, it seemed like a weird reason. I was a bit disappointed and that was the end of that.\n\nBut then, a year or two later, there was an episode of DW called Asylum of the Daleks, which seemed incredibly similar to my story except with Daleks. So incredibly, eerily, similar in fact, that to this day I am absolutely convinced that Steven Moffat saw my script and came up with a formatting excuse so that he could remove me from the competition, steal my story, change the bad guys and claim it as his own. I have zero evidence, I don't even still have the treatment I wrote, or any letter from the BBC about my submission, and yet I know in my bones that Steven Moffat stole his script from 10 yr old me.", "label": 1}

The techniques required started to veer out of the realm of home baker and more towards a professional, or very niche specialities. Plus, I'm sure in one challenge (might have been a technical) one of the judges even said that normally the bake would be left overnight, but the bakers were only given 2 hours (or something similar). That just ruined it for me - I'm all for challenging bakes, but to purposefully limit the time given, or make the challenges artificially difficult such that it's nigh on impossible to produce a satisfactory bake just feels cruel and totally against the spirit of the gentle cosy baking show I used to enjoy.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Before I begin answering the question, I will acknowledge that war itself is obviously a great evil. That is, war inevitably brings suffering and destruction. Despite this, inherent goodness and waging war aren't mutually exclusive. I'd like to propose a few different models that effectively rid us of this seeming contradiction.\n\nThere may be a subset of inherently good humans, a subset of inherently evil humans, and subsets of in-betweeners.  Your point doesn't extend to pacifists for example, pacifists don't participate in war. Your question relies on the assumption that it's either all or none, when that's really not the case. Humanity is fairly diverse, some humans might be inherently good while others aren't.\n\nAdditionally, war itself is a great burden for all, but do we really wage war just because we're evil and want to see the world burn? I don't agree with that notion. The common man is usually forced to wage war because the ruler made the decision for them. That is, war might not be an issue with human nature, but with the nature of power. If one is coerced to participate in war against their own free will, for example by the looming threat of court-martial for every deserter, does that take away from their goodness? You have to account for that possibility, and your admittedly punchy question fails to do so on its own.\n\nComing back to the humans are diverse argument, do you agree that self-defense doesn't reduce one's goodness? If forced to choose between your own life and the life of another, it's certainly acceptable to choose your own. A life is gonna be lost anyway, therefore protecting yourself, even when lethal force is necessary, is equivalent to letting the attacker kill you. In cases where the killer chose to kill on their own volition, killing them is actually beneficial. If they freely chose to kill now, they are likelier to freely choose to kill again. Whilst you, who was coerced into defending yourself, are unlikelier to freely choose to kill, because there's no precedent of you doing so before. \n\nBy similar logic, a society defending itself when another wages war on it doesn't reduce its goodness. There might be a pattern of evil expansionist cultures emerging all throughout history, and the peaceful cultures are then forced to defend themselves. That could explain why conflict has always been a part of human history. Some societies are expansionist, some are otherwise peaceful but choose to defend themselves when attacked.\n\nLeaving all the previous arguments behind, it certainly might be the case that humans are not inherently good. But that doesn't necessarily mean we're doomed to be evil. Take Christianity for example. Christianity posits that we are all born with the original sin, that is we are born evil. We only become good by absolving ourselves of the original sin. Therefore, it is uncertain at the time of a human's birth whether they will become good, but they have the inherent capacity to do so. Your question is very fatalist on its own, because it obscures the human's capacity for change. But once you take that possibility into account, reality doesn't look as grim anymore.\n\nI could also go into a determinist line of thought and say that the human's actions are purely a result of their genetics and their environment, which makes the process completely determined and outside the human's control. Can we really consider someone evil if they inherently have no control over their own actions? Can we even meaningfully define good and evil in such a model?\n\nOverall, my point is that the world is most likely gray. Good and evil both exist. I personally believe that the vast majority of humans possess the capacity for goodness, how often do they actually manage to realize that capacity and how to go about realizing it are questions that extend beyond the scope of this comment.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I asked my grandpa what it felt like to grow old. Grandpa is a man who will deliberate on which part of the newspaper to start with each morning, so I knew my question would take him some time to answer. I said nothing. I let him gather his thoughts.\n\nWhen I was a boy, Grandpa had once complimented me on this habit. He told me it was good that I asked a question and gave a person silence. And being that any compliment from him was so few and far between, this habit soon became a part of my personality and one that served me well.\n\nGrandpa stared out the window and looked at the empty bird feeder that hung from an overgrown tree next to the pond he built in the spring of 1993. For twenty years, Grandpa filled up the feeder each evening. But he stopped doing it last winter when walking became too difficult for him.\n\nWithout ever taking his eyes from the window, he asked me a question: \u201cHave you ever been in a hot shower when the water ran cold?\u201d I told him I had.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what aging feels like. In the beginning of your life it\u2019s like you\u2019re standing in a hot shower. At first the water is too warm, but you eventually grow used to the heat and begin enjoying it. But you take it for granted when you\u2019re young and think it\u2019s going to be this way forever. Life goes on like this for some time.\u201d\n\nGrandpa looked at me with those eyes that had seen so much change in this world. He smiled and winked at me.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re lucky, a few good looking women will join you in the shower from time to time.\u201d\n\nWe laughed. He looked out the window and continued on.\n\n\u201cYou begin to feel it in your forties and fifties. The water temperature declines just the slightest bit. It\u2019s almost imperceptible, but you know it happened and you know what it means. You try to pretend like you didn\u2019t feel it, but you still turn the faucet up to stay warm. But the water keeps going lukewarm. One day you realize the faucet can\u2019t go any further, and from here on out the temperature begins to drop. And everyday you feel the warmth gradually leaving your body.\u201d\n\nGrandpa cleared his throat and pulled a stained handkerchief from his flannel shirt pocket. He blew his nose, balled up the handkerchief, and put it back in his pocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rather helpless feeling, truth told. The water is still pleasant, but you know it will soon become cold and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. This is the point when some people decide to leave the shower on their own terms. They know it's never going to get warmer, so why prolong the inevitable? I was able to stay in because I contented myself recalling the showers of my youth. I lived a good life, but still wish I hadn\u2019t taken my youth for granted. But it\u2019s too late now. No matter how hard I try, I know I\u2019ll never get the hot water back on again.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a few moments and kept looking out the window with those eyes that had seen ninety-one years on this Earth. Those eyes that lived through the Great Depression, those eyes that beheld the Pacific Ocean in World War II, those eyes that saw the birth of his three children, five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHe had indeed lived a good life, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what it feels like to grow old.\u201d", "label": 1}

{"text": "Because Trump represents a mouthpiece for frustrations and anger a non-insignificant portion of the country has felt for many, MANY years.\n\nAnd believe it or not, some of it is based in reality, actually. Poor, working class folk have been getting shit on for decades, all while politicians from both sides of the isle have used them as a soapbox and stood on their backs while they talk about revitalizing industry and manufacturing. But it's just getting worse and worse. They know the establishment has been lying to them all these years.\n\nThis is what I actually identify and can understand about Trump. I don't think he'll actually do anything this time around (again), but it's simply enough that his words are vitriolic against a system they feel has used them. And I admit, I was on board in 2015 for a while too, seeing and living that life first hand.\n\nSome of it, however, is based on bigotry and fear. They see that language, gender and social norms have changed in a way they don't understand or makes them uncomfortable. Rather than learn or adapt, they want to make it go away with Religion and old timey values. Which Trump also speaks to at length.\n\nThis is where my belief diverged. There's no place in a country like ours to marginalize people simply because of who they love or who they are and Religion isn't the answer to anything other than personal comfort.\n\nTrump has the same swaggar and \"I don't care\" attitude that they see in themselves when they're at the bar drinking with their buddies and complaining about politics. He's not interested in \"decorum\" or \"compromise\" and neither are they. That set of political values is endemic of the very system they feel has been using and ignoring their needs for decades.\n\nHis legal troubles are all largely insignificant to them because his followers believe they are the symptom of the system trying to get rid of him, his messaging and his base. Of course they'll \"vote for a felon\" because Trump's felonies are a mark of just how scared they are of him and his followers.\n\nI've said it several times. The MAGA movement and the Progressive left want the same thing: A paradigm shift in how government works for the people. It's just they don't agree on exactly WHAT that paradigm shift is.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have a Computer Science degree from before the World-Wide Web. I took some classes on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, as that was my main interest at the time.\n\nThe main problem with AI is not the technology itself, but how people who make decisions misunderstand it and choose to apply it.\n\nThere are many instances I can think of, but the current debacle with Google's AI search results shows the problem. Just because something looks like English text doesn't mean it is safe and reliable English text. But a quick outline of other issues:\n\n* Air Canada got a chatbot, which offered someone a discount that didn't exist, and Air Canada tried to argue that they weren't responsible for it.\n* An eating disorder helpline was changed over to a chatbot that started giving out dieting advice.\n* A couple of health insurers in the United States tried to use an AI tool to make decisions about whether procedures should be covered or not, without a human making a concurring decision.\n* Who knows how many teachers or professors think that ChatGPT can determine if something was written by similar systems, leading to claims of plagiarism where none exists.\n\nWe use AI all the time. The spelling and grammar checking we get when we type on the web, or use in text messages, is part of it.\n\nBut when you have company executives who decide that an AI is just the thing to replace people in responsible positions, with no oversight or double-checks, you have a recipe for disaster, as the examples above indicate.\n\nThe technology is fabulous, it is like interacting with HAL 9000 from\u00a0*2001: A Space Odyssey.*\u00a0Except that all it is really doing is generating text, not making any real decisions, drawing conclusions, or anything like that. I saw a news item the other week claiming that \"we fed Trump's Hush-Money trial information to ChatGPT and asked it how it would vote if it was a juror, and it said 'guilty.'\" To me, that's not very different from asking a Magic Eight Ball if Trump is guilty.\n\nI can get into my reasoning if you want technical details; I'm no luddite. I have a corporate IT job, and we have our own internal conversational AI, so we can avoid putting proprietary information out in public.\n\nWe keep hearing stories of how a trained AI turns out \"bad\" in some way or other. Google's Snafu is just the latest example. (If you want to make Chrome or Firefox go back to the web-only results,\u00a0[there is a way](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-searchs-udm14-trick-lets-you-kill-ai-search-for-good/).)
