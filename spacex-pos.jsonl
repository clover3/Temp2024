{"text": "> public and private insurance\n\nThis one is funny, because the government didn't want to do the work and they left it for private parties, while regulating it and making it mandatory to the point that the private parties are practically operating as a governmental insurance. So, in essence there is no difference. \n\n>allows gun ownership under specific circumstances\n\nVery very very very, specific circumstances. But gun ownership has never been that big of an issue to be politiziced here. And most of the descision making was left to the civil servants advising the minister of internal security. However, I do know for a fact (personal relations) that the civil servants are now actually advocating for a pretty harsh ban on everything firearms related. So this will start to become politizized. Where probably half of the 15 political parties will agree on banning all firearms. So in that sense, we have 75 bernie sanders in parliament. \n\n> restrictions on immigration\n\nAbout 60% is for EXTREME restrictions of migration. That leaves 40% to be against these harsh restrictions. With 15-20% advocating for free-er restrictions.\n\n----\n\nYou make the mistake by assuming that governing parties and policies mean that there are no parties who would change this into a more left oriented policy. Yes the current (and past 10 years) Dutch government have been predominantly right. This does not mean that there are no representatives advocating for a more left direction. Because we have those. I'd say that Bernie sanders policies are shared by the PvDA-GL, PvDD and SP. And most points would be shared by the CU (but they are a weird progressive, but chrisian conservative party). That totals a 36 seats of the 150 that share bernies perspective, and I know, they even have stances that go much further than that. \n\nFor example the thing PVDA-GL and SP (30 seats) are advocating for is a limit on income AND a limit on wealth. Imagine that being presented in the US. SP is more on the extreme end of left, but not the furthest left in policies if you take communist (the historical interpretation, not the American one) perspectives into account.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Are you real? Do you even know what literal communism is? I feel like you have no perception of the differences between socialist perspectives and communist ones. Communism, like we've seen tried in historical perspectives is quite literally the DEFINITION of extreme left.\n\nAnd moreover, this was not even relevant. It was about the question if there was extreme left in the us politics. And my answer is and remains that the answer is: No, not from the Dutch perspective. And laughably so, not even from the US political perspectives. Because lets not forget the historical periods of the US when there was in fact a 90% top marginal tax on income. 1944-1963.\n\nI am just explaining that there is no extreme left in the US political debate as seen from the perspective of the Dutch political landscape. My perception of what I find far left is quite irrelevant in this. On top of this, I quite literally presented that from the Dutch perspective, that is about 25% of the people, what you call extreme left, is not extreme left. Contrary, it is within mainstream discussions or the overton window if you prefer that term.\n\n------\n\nAnd yes, there are extreme left perspectives from my point of view. Like I said, irrelevant to the discussion above, but I'll entertain you. Something turns into extreme left to me when the state starts to take care of things outside of the basic needs area, such as housing, livelihood, education, healthcare, public transport, etc... Such as directly steering the industrial output in for example five year plans and completely eliminating free market principles. Because that is Communism... That is far and extreme left to me, as the original meaning of the terminology holds. The same that far and extreme right are political parties that tick more boxes on the fascism scale of Lawrence, than I have fingers (on one hand, i'm critical..). \n\nI'd like to think that this view and scale would represent the entire political spectrum and would be universal due to its basis in political history. But I am mistaken in this.\n\nLet me ask a question to you. How do you define literal communism (historical application) if Bernie sanders (which again, shares 25% of Dutch opinion) is already called extreme left?", "label": 1}

Next time, please simply ask instead of insulting someone.\n\n\n\nI was genuinely confused because you seemed to think that 100% government run health care with no private option is not \"far left\". So, I asked for you to share what you think far left is.\n\n\nAnd, to be quite honest, I completely disagree that the only definition of \"far left\" is Communism. Like many things, I think there is a spectrum and I don't subscribe to the idea that Communism is the only political philosophy or ideology that counts as far left.\n\n\nPeople constantly say \"America is so far to the right of Europe that there is no \"far left\" in America.\" Maybe, from certain perspectives, it is more that Europe is so far left that they only see \"Communism\" as far left and don't realize that there might be more to that term?", "label": 1}

{"text": "Geeeeezus. When you generically state \u201cwords mean nothing\u201d as you have multiple times, the implication you\u2019ve made clear is that in your opinion \u201cwords\u201d have no causal or consequential relationship with adverse actions because they\u2019re only words, and so we can all confidently sit back and just ignore the words knowing everything will be rosy.\n\nIt only takes one single counter-example to prove this premise false, yet there are many throughout all of history. In fact many terrible actions clearly trace their origins back to \u201cwords\u201d, except for example something like a random impulse killing. If this were not the case, the verb \u201cincite\u201d would not exist. So your premise is obviously bullshit from the start, but to state \u201cthe words mean nothing if the action didn\u2019t happen\u201d also ignores all future consequences. So an action didn\u2019t happen when? Within 5 minutes? 5 days? 5 weeks? What\u2019s the statute of limitations when you formally decide that they\u2019ve led to no actions or consequences?

Presently, SpaceX doesn't have a backlog of ships to launch. They're machine, not regulation limited.\n\n  \nThat's not to say overactive regulatory bodies haven't played a role in slowing them down. I'm not a Trump supporter, but I too will be happy if SpaceX gets a longer leash to operate.  That said, it is fiction to blame Biden or the FAA for how long it took to the pad ready for launching Starship.
