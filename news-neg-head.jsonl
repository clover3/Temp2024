{"text": "1/2\n\nElon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and a linchpin of U.S. space efforts, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022.\n\nThe discussions, confirmed by several current and former U.S., European and Russian officials, touch on personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions.\nAt one point, Putin asked the billionaire to avoid activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, said two people briefed on the request.\n\nMusk has emerged this year as a crucial supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, and could find a role in a Trump administration should he win. While the U.S. and its allies have isolated Putin in recent years, Musk\u2019s dialogue could signal re-engagement with the Russian leader, and reinforce Trump\u2019s expressed desire to cut a deal over major fault lines such as the war in Ukraine. \n\nAt the same time, the contacts also raise potential national-security concerns among some in the current administration, given Putin\u2019s role as one of America\u2019s chief adversaries. \n\nMusk has forged deep business ties with U.S. military and intelligence agencies, giving him unique visibility into some of America\u2019s most sensitive space programs. SpaceX, which operates the Starlink service, won a $1.8 billion classified contract in 2021 and is the primary rocket launcher for the Pentagon and NASA. Musk has a security clearance that allows him access to certain classified information.\n\nKnowledge of Musk\u2019s Kremlin contacts appears to be a closely held secret in government. Several White House officials said they weren\u2019t aware of them. The topic is highly sensitive, given Musk\u2019s increasing involvement in the Trump campaign and the approaching U.S. presidential election, less than two weeks away. \n\nMusk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The billionaire has called criticism from some quarters that he has become an apologist for Putin \u201cabsurd\u201d and has said his companies \u201chave done more to undermine Russia than anything.\u201d\n\nDuring his campaign swing through Pennsylvania last week, Musk talked about the importance of government transparency and noted his own access to government secrets. \u201cI do have a top-secret clearance, but, I\u2019d have to say, like most of the stuff that I\u2019m aware of\u2026the reason they keep it top secret is because it\u2019s so boring.\u201d\nA Pentagon spokesman said: \u201cWe do not comment on any individual\u2019s security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nOne person aware of the conversations said the government faces a dilemma because it is so dependent on the billionaire\u2019s technologies. SpaceX launches vital national security satellites into orbit and is the company NASA relies on to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station. \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t love it,\u201d the person said, referring to the Musk-Putin contacts. The person, however, said no alerts have been raised by the administration over possible security breaches by Musk.\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the only communication the Kremlin has had with Musk was over one telephone call in which he and Putin discussed \u201cspace as well as current and future technologies.\u201d \n\nApart from that, he said neither Putin nor Kremlin officials were holding regular conversations with Musk.\n\nA spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s campaign called Musk \u201ca once-in-a-generation industry leader\u201d and said \u201cour broken federal bureaucracy could certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for Putin,\u201d the spokeswoman continued, \u201cthere\u2019s only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under, and it\u2019s President Trump. President Trump has long said that he will re-establish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia\u2019s aggression and end the war in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n####A BOTTLE OF VODKA\n\n\nMusk has long had a fascination with Russia and its space and rocket programs. Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Musk said the businessman traveled to Moscow in 2002 to negotiate the purchase of rockets for his fledgling space program, but passed out during a vodka-heavy lunch. The sale ultimately failed, though his Russian hosts gave Musk a bottle of vodka with his likeness superimposed on a drawing of Mars.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s conversations with Putin and Kremlin officials highlight his increasing inclination to stretch beyond business and into geopolitics. He has met several times and talked business with Javier Milei of Argentina, as well as former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he defended in an acrimonious online debate. \n\nPutin is on a different order of magnitude. The Russian leader has created an authoritarian system that oversees fraudulent elections and the assassinations of political opponents, for which President Biden called him a \u201ckiller.\u201d With keys to one of the world\u2019s most powerful nuclear arsenals and growing territorial ambitions in Europe, Putin has become the U.S.\u2019s chief antagonist.\n\nLabeling him a \u201cdespot,\u201d the Treasury Department took the unusual step in 2022 of blacklisting him for invading Ukraine, putting him in the same company with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. \n\nIn October 2022, Musk said publicly that he had spoken only once to Putin. He said on X that the conversation was about space, and that it occurred around April 2021. \n\nBut more conversations have followed, including dialogues with other high-ranking Russian officials past 2022 and into this year. One of the officials was Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin\u2019s first deputy chief of staff, two of the officials said. What the two talked about isn\u2019t clear.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Justice Department said in an affidavit that Kiriyenko had created some 30 internet domains to spread Russian disinformation, including on Musk\u2019s X, where it was meant to erode support for Ukraine and manipulate American voters ahead of the presidential election. \n\nAfter the Russian invasion in February 2022, Musk at first made strong public statements of support for Kyiv. He posted \u201cHold Strong Ukraine,\u201d flanked by Ukrainian flags on what was then still known as Twitter. Shortly after, he jokingly challenged Putin to one-on-one combat over \u201c\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430,\u201d the Ukrainian language name for the country.\n\nHe followed up by donating several hundred Starlink terminals to Ukraine. By July some 15,000 terminals were providing free internet access to broad swaths of the country destroyed by the Russian attacks.\n\nLater that year, Musk\u2019s view of the conflict appeared to change. In September, Ukrainian military operatives weren\u2019t able to use Starlink terminals to guide sea drones to attack a Russian naval base in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow had occupied since 2014. Ukraine tried to persuade Musk to activate the Starlink service in the area, but that didn\u2019t happen, the Journal has reported.\n\nHis space company extended restrictions on the use of Starlink in offensive operations by Ukraine. Musk said later that he made the move because Starlink is meant for civilian uses and that he believed any Ukrainian attack on Crimea could spark a nuclear war.\n\n\nHis moves coincided with public and private pressure from the Kremlin. In May 2022, Russia\u2019s space chief said in a post on Telegram that Musk would \u201canswer like an adult\u201d for supplying Starlink to Ukraine\u2019s Azov battalion, which the Kremlin had singled out for the ultraright ideology espoused by some members.\n\nLater in 2022, Musk was having regular conversations with \u201chigh-level Russians,\u201d according to a person familiar with the interactions. At the time, there was pressure from the Kremlin on Musk\u2019s businesses and \u201cimplicit threats against him,\u201d the person said. \n\nAt the same time, Musk increasingly took to Twitter, for which he was completing the purchase, to say SpaceX was losing money by funding the operation of the terminals.  \n\nIn October 2022, he asked his tens of millions of followers on X to vote on a pathway to peace that mirrored some aspects of the Kremlin\u2019s offer to Ukraine at the time.\n\nThose conditions included continued Russian occupation of Crimea and Ukrainian neutrality outside of NATO. He also specified that Ukraine should continue allowing the supply of water to Crimea, an issue that had been an important concern of the Kremlin before the war.\n\nOne current and one former intelligence source said that Musk and Putin have continued to have contact since then and into this year as Musk began stepping up his criticism of the U.S. military aid to Ukraine and became involved in Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\n####\u2018RED LINES\u2019\n\nIn the fall of 2022, political scientist Ian Bremmer, founder of New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, wrote on Twitter that Musk had told him he had spoken with Putin and Kremlin officials about Ukraine. \u201cHe also told me what the Kremlin\u2019s red lines were,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBremmer wrote in a newsletter to subscribers that Musk had relayed to him a message from Putin that Russia would secure Crimea and Ukrainian neutrality \u201cno matter what,\u201d and that it would respond to a Ukrainian invasion of Crimea with a nuclear strike. Musk said that \u201ceverything needed to be done to avoid that outcome,\u201d Bremmer wrote.\n\nMusk has publicly denied he said any of those things to Bremmer.\n\nIn the past year, Musk and Russia\u2019s interests have increasingly overlapped. Apart from Russia\u2019s use of X for disinformation and Musk\u2019s outspoken opposition to aid to Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said earlier this year that Russian forces occupying the country\u2019s eastern and southern swaths had started using Starlink to enable secure communications and extend the range of their drones.", "label": 0}

On your way back with your load you go down a steep hill, speeding, the brakes go out and you run a red light killing the driver of the other vehicle.\n\nIn this scenario there is criminal culpability on multiple levels.  The driver was charged with DUI, for operating a vehicle under the influence of methamphetamine.  The owner of the company was also charged because he knowingly put the truck back on the road multiple times despite clear records indicating an ongoing problem.  That day when notified the issue was persisting he merely told the driver to \"be careful and get it back to the yard\" rather than take it out of service.

While they describe themselves as a church, and they did emerge from the union of two heterodox Christian groups, they aren\u2019t Christian anymore.

It could be found by the jury that they believe there should be one and that following SAG guidelines should be considered 'due circumspection' as opposed to the current standard (that I believe says treat every gun as if loaded, don't point a gun at something you're not willing to destroy, and keep your finger off the trigger until you are going to fire), but that has yet, as far as I am aware, not been decided and become case law/precedent.\n\nWith this fact pattern I am certain 10/10 times I would be charged, you would be charged, Keanu Reeves would be charged, or Denzel Washington would be charged.  You and I would almost assuredly be convicted, 50/50 on John Wick and Man on Fire though...\n\nI'd also point out that Baldwin was handed the gun by assistant director Halls, and Baldwin was, or should have been, aware of multiple negligent discharges on set, and waived inspecting the gun himself for a blocking practice that didn't require him to use a gun nor point it at anyone...\n\n...So even if in theory there should be a carve out for industry standards counting as 'due circumspection' there is a fact question for the jury on whether those industry standards were even followed here.\n\nSo the tl;dr: the fact pattern in the case against Baldwin would have landed you or I in jail every single time, and even with this happening on a movie set the law and sloppiness on set would have exposed Baldwin to a serious risk of being convicted by a jury.", "label": 0}

The margin of victory was only 449 votes in an election with over one million votes cast. However, the judge found clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n- 983 votes were cast by individuals who did not reside in Harris County, listed incorrect residences, or used non-residential addresses (such as PO boxes).\n- 40 absentee ballots lacked required signatures, and 8 ballots were mailed late.\n- 445 voters did not provide proper identification or acceptable substitute documentation.\n- 5 provisional ballots lacked a signature, and one lacked a photo ID or acceptable substitute.\n\nIn total, the court ruled that 1,482 illegal votes were cast, significantly exceeding the 449-vote margin between the two candidates.

(KION-TV)** -- A man with an AK-style rifle walked 8th and Monte Verde streets in Carmel Friday, multiple witnesses told KION.\n\nThe Monterey Sheriff's Office confirmed that the suspect is now dead.

This after deescalate efforts failed, according to the Monterey County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies said that the suspect's mother and a neighbor were the people who notified police, and that his mother said that he had told her he wanted to die in an officer-involved shooting.\n\nAccording to Golden Bough Playhouse Executive Director Stephen Moorer, the man was walking in a barricaded area and police were notified, arrived on the scene and then shot bean bags at the suspect. Moorer said he saw the man being carried out on a gurney.\n\nThe DA's office confirms to KION that they have taken over to investigate the \"officer involved shooting.\"", "label": 0}
