If you can get 30-40g of protein per meal, your meals will make you feel more satiated and balance your blood sugar. Just try that alone and see how you feel. I think it's one of the easiest and most looked-over aspects of dieting that truly isn't restrictive. Just add more protein.

{"text": "Hey, regarding the loneliness part: You should consider adopting a dog! Dogs are amazing companions, and the benefits of a bond / relationship between owner and pup are not only amazing, but they go both ways (as in, you will benefit from it much more than you may think). I cannot fathom how I would have made it through some of the stuff life has thrown at me in the past \\~8 years, if it weren't for my pup.\n\n\n\nAssuming you treat the dog well and genuinely care for it, the return is invaluable; fulfilling your pup's needs symbiotically fulfills your fundamental needs as well - exercise, affection, attention, a routine, and responsibility. These fundamentals are critical, especially when we're stuck, lost, or when it feels like life just won't turn off the fucking hose. The emotional support is huge - when I feel down or discouraged, tired or stuck, or like the stress keeps piling on, I can love on my pup and before I know it we're either playing with a toy or he's refusing to let the belly rubs end. It's a small reprieve, yet surprisingly rejuvenating. Sometimes, I'll let out a sigh if I'm kind of annoyed by something or maybe focusing really heavily on a work task - and suddenly he's physically \"forcing\" his nose into my hand because he thinks something is wrong and he's trying to help \ud83d\ude2d!\n\n  \nWalking the pup means you getting out and moving more, too! Changing your environment and taking walks in nature has obvious, well known benefits for the brain and body - likely you'll find yourself forming new hobbies as things will feel more fun by having a companion with you to do them with! I never thought I'd be into hiking, and through changing up our normal walk routine with my pup early on, found I love it! As well, going to dog parks and such opens up more opportunities to meet people that you can strike up conversation with and form new connections and relationships!\n\n  \nI hope this provided a more outside-the-box idea, as what you're going through doesn't quite have a simple solution or set of steps that will \"fix\" your situation. That being said, these are just the benefits of having a pup, and you should only consider adoption if you're sincere about owning and taking care of the animal with compassion. I'm not suggesting that you, or anybody \"just get a dog\" without the intention to sincerely care for said animal, thinking it will magically fix a situation.\n\n  \nBest of luck, you've got this, even if it doesn't seem like it right now, and take care of your self!", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've been here too, and was able to move on with my life, and at an older age than you. This is how I do it:\n\nThink about where you want to be in 5 years. Maybe it's a different city, maybe a different job, maybe a specific type of relationship. Then make a plan for how you will get there. Aim fairly high (but don't be absurd) and you will be so suprised on how far you can get in a few years.\n\nSo for example let's say you want to have a job making 100K+ that you enjoy and you want to be living in a beach town with a solid relationship in 5 years. First pick a career path, then figure out what the requirements are (certifications, education, portfolio), then start down that road. Look for a job that is in demand in those beach towns and start working on networking with people that may eventually hire you. And then for the relationship start bettering yourself financially (saving and investing, minimizing bad debt), physically (start working out a few time a week to gain confidence), emotionally (start seeing a counsellor once a month to sort out your issues), and mentally (find exciting or interesting hobbies, or volunteer somewhere locally).\n\nThis may sound like a lot but take it slow and just start throwing yourself into life a bit more intentionally. But of course first figure out a future that gets you excited. If nothing gets you excited now, pick the best option. And don't overthink. Just set a trajectory and start moving.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This was me for a VERY long time. You're not broken, you're just focused on the wrong things. You've been on the couch daydreaming about the top of the mountain for so long that you're out of shape for the hike. The longer you fixate on the goal, the farther you are from achieving it.\n\nYou have to climb that mountain because you genuinely want to see the view for yourself, not because you want to be seen by your crush at the top or whatever. It's got to be a gift from you **for you**. And you get there by unplugging from the dream, getting off the couch, and working on yourself until you can climb that mountain.\n\n\n\nStart by unplugging. Make a deal with yourself that you are not going to pursue a romantic relationship for 6 months or a year. A good romantic relationship starts with two complete, healthy individuals. You don't sound like you're ready for that yet, and reaching beyond your means will get you continually rejected. That hurts, and it leaves you vulnerable to being taken advantage of. Stop letting other people hurt you like that. **You deserve better.** \n\nYou can never control the way people feel about you. So your happiness shouldn't be dependent on other people's perception of you, ESPECIALLY if you're so desperate for validation that you'll give anyone that kind of power over you.\n\nSo write off that goal for 6 months or a year.  No romantic relationships. Not until you're ready. Be serious about this. If you don't remove that pressure from yourself, you're never going to make progress. Unplug from the daydream and get off the couch.   \n  \nIt's time to go to work.\n\nRedirect that energy and focus on building a healthy relationship with yourself first. Make yourself the one you want to impress. Make yourself the one you're willing to woo, and show off, and work hard for.\n\nTo start, focus on finding your own validation and self-worth. If you're not sure where to begin, start with volunteer work. With volunteer work, just showing up and giving your time and effort IS the value people are looking for, so you can't psych yourself out or beat yourself up by minimizing your contribution. Ask for the help you need and contribute what you can.\n\nJust focus on just being an asset for your own sake until you internalize that healthier view of yourself and develop healthier motivations. In time, your self-directed negativity will give way to this more confident identity. It won't happen quickly. You'll have bad days where you doubt yourself. That's okay. **You're doing fine.**\n\n\n\nFigure out how to incorporate that healthier motivation into more parts of your life. Study hard and do chores the best you can just to show off for yourself. Make yourself the person you're trying to impress. All the effort you invest into yourself pays you back in the form of a more confident identity. Keep expanding. Keep impressing yourself. You're the one controlling your happiness. This is your journey now. You're on **your** path.\n\nEventually, you're going to start meeting more people on similar paths going in the same direction. You'll find that these people gravitate to you more easily. You can work on making friends based on these common interests (like hobbies, school, or the volunteering you've been doing). \n\nWhen you're a more complete individual, you have a healthy mindset (internal) and a healthy social life (external), the relationships around you will naturally deepen because of shared values. Some will become close friends, some may become romantic. All will require effort and upkeep, but none will require forcing. That's the happiness you're really looking for.  \n\n\nIt's a long road, and it's hard to stay focused and true to yourself. But you're not alone on this journey. It's worth it. **You're worth it.** And I can't wait until you meet the real you at the end of it.\n\nIt's time to unplug. It's time to get to work. Good luck. I'll see you out there.", "label": 0}

Don\u2019t worry about the diet side yet either. \n\nI used to love the gym and then hated it for years. This October I decided I was going to change my lifestyle and didn\u2019t have an expectation of what I wanted to look like, I just wanted to do it for me, my body and my mental health and suddenly I fell in love with it. I hit 3 weeks of gym finally and don\u2019t  feel any type of hatred for it. \n\nFall in love with the gym first, be present in the gym, do workouts that make you feel good and just use 1/2 machines for each part of your body. You don\u2019t need to spend hours in the gym and make yourself suffer, building a habit without any goals or expectations is what worked for me and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work for you. \n\nI also started my ashwaganda (herbal supplement) again too, it really benefits you, I would look into that, you can get a 4 year supply for \u00a38 on Amazon but make sure to phase off it every 3 months and initially it\u2019ll take 2 weeks for the affects to work. Ofcourse do your research first according to any health issues you may have but as it\u2019s a herbal supplement no chemicals, it should be harmless.\n\nI hope that helps!", "label": 0}

{"text": "It\u2019s a tough process, and it sounds like you\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can make it harder to feel connected. One thing that really helps is to start focusing on activities that naturally make you feel good or bring out your strengths, whether it\u2019s a hobby, a new skill, or a project that you\u2019re genuinely excited about. Sometimes, when you\u2019re fully engaged in something you enjoy, the right people tend to gravitate toward you because they see you at your best.\n\n\n\nAlso, consider quality over quantity when it comes to connections. You don\u2019t need a lot of friends; you need the right ones who appreciate you for who you are. Joining groups, communities, or classes around a shared interest can create those organic connections, when people are there for the same reason, conversations often start more naturally, and there\u2019s less pressure.\n\n\n\nLastly, working on how you see yourself can change how you feel around others. Instead of viewing social interactions as a way to prove your worth, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow, to share and be curious. You\u2019re enough as you are, and the more comfortable you feel with yourself, the more likely it is that others will feel the same way.", "label": 0}

It\u2019s like going to the gym, you don\u2019t see the results immediately, but every rep counts. Also, I try to focus on the small wins and the parts of the process I can control. Sometimes just showing up and putting in the effort is a win in itself.\n\nAnd if I ever really get stuck, I take a step back, refocus on why I started, and ask myself if there\u2019s a way to approach things differently. That way, I\u2019m still moving forward, even if it\u2019s in a slightly new direction.\n\nRemember James Dyson, the founder of the Dyson vacuum cleaner famously failed 5,126 times before finally getting his vacuum working as he wanted.

It's like waiting for your crush to text you first - ain't gonna happen reliably \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe real secret? Stop giving a fuck about \"should.\" That's just society's programming making you feel guilty. You're not failing at bass - you're just comparing yourself to some imaginary standard. That's like comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone's highlight reel.\n\nHere's the galaxy brain move: Instead of fighting your phone addiction, become AWARE of it. Next time you grab your phone, just pause and think \"damn, am I doing this because I want to or because I'm running from something?\" \ud83e\udd14\n\nThe Bible reading? Do it because you vibe with it, not because you \"should.\" Read one verse that hits different and actually live it instead of speed-running through chapters like it's a game lmao.\n\nPro tip: The reason nothing feels fun anymore is because you're doing everything with this heavy \"I must improve\" energy. Like trying to dance while overthinking every move - you're gonna look stiff af.\n\nTL;DR: Stop trying so hard. Life's not a productivity contest. Do things because they spark joy (yes I just Marie Kondo'd your existential crisis).

Think of each small action as a way to gradually build that lost willpower. Progress won\u2019t be immediate, but every step counts toward pulling yourself out of the rut you\u2019re in.

{"text": "Being active.. as the sun is out, whether it\u2019s a walk, listening to a book, while walking a trail.. just getting out. Saying hello and giving a compliment at times it\u2019s appropriate of course rather than normally just go to the store or grab a coffee or whatever and just leave.. when you feel like you don\u2019t want to do something.. or have the opportunity to hang out.. just do it at least 1 times out of the few times you don\u2019t feel like doing something.. \n\nMost importantly, for me, being consistent. Waking up and making the bed immediately after the alarm goes off, make coffee and a protein shake in the morning and take my vitamins. Ensure that nothing is left in the sink.. and get to work a bit early from there so I\u2019m not rushed and set myself up for the day to alleviate the stress of work as much as possible.. getting a haircut consistently and ensure my clothes are cleaned and proper. Seems silly, but feeling good about how you look, really builds confidence.\n\nAll these are just small things that we do all the time, but staying consistent allows you to feel accomplished and sets you up to be happy.. I also look myself in the mirror after brushing my teeth, and say good morning and smile.. lol I know it\u2019s weird, but it gives you something that usually you reserve for others. \n\nI\u2019m a huuuge believer of the law of attraction.. put good out in this world and the world becomes a happier place. I used to make excuses for my shortcomings and look at others success as a measurement of my own. My mindset is completely different now, as i started practicing to celebrate others for their success and be more humble about where I want to be and how I will get there.. rather than tearing others down, now I\u2019m more open to learning from them. It builds a better peaceful harmonious connections that allows you to be out there respected and just positive.\n\nOften times negative thoughts come to my head.. and I immediately recognize that I\u2019m doing it and think well instead of thinking what could have should have been done.. what lesson can I learn from it.. and then turn it into a positive thought in a way of a making a goal to achieve that. But I can say this, thinking of positive thoughts to outweigh the negative ones to really help.. try to limit those negative thoughts altogether, as that will consume your energy and overall create a negative mindset and negative approach to things. \n\nI don\u2019t do this as often any more, but I used to constantly write In a journal. At first it was more about the day and what occurred and what I did, but someone recommended that I instead take an inventory of how I accomplished or gotten closer to my goals, and then write what I\u2019m looking forward to for the next day and what my plan will be my plan to get closer to my goals. It changed the perspective of living in the past, to living for the future. \n\nI hope this helps.. it most certainly helped me.. and I can say I have become a more present Father, friend, son, and coworker. I\u2019ve gotten unsolicited promotions. I\u2019m so proud of myself for making these changes that the world just seems better. I know that I want more.. I\u2019m just less concerned about where I am now compared to where I think I should be.. accepted where I am currently, because it is what it is, and take ownership of the things I could be better at, and then take action so that I can take that step towards where I want to be. Inaction is the same as approving the life you have now.. doesn\u2019t matter how much you complain- nothing will change except change itself. Enjoy the journey.. because goals aren\u2019t easy to achieve, so it always seems sooo far away.. but the finish line is there whether you see it or not, but be confident that you\u2019re taking a step towards that direction each day.. and soon enough, the finish line will be in sight. \n\nBut I\u2019m happy that you are asking the right question.. that\u2019s one step closer to your happy place. Enjoy your journey", "label": 0}

{"text": "The previous comment is bullshit. A woman with good mental health isn\u2019t going to chase after someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want/need them. Seeking validation from someone who doesn\u2019t even like you is lacking self worth and trying to find it elsewhere - AKA that person clearly has personal problems. And seldom does someone seek out a partner with confidence/self worth/trauma/mental issues for good reason (a person is clearly easier to control/abuse when you can act like you don\u2019t care about them and they pine for your acknowledgment). \n\n**If someone is attracted to you and likes you, they will be excited to be with you. And they will be excited that you want to be with them.** *No one who is mentally sound gets excited that someone is uninterested in them.* Do you think I would have wasted any of my time if my boyfriend didn\u2019t have a good conversation with me when I met him asking about things I do or like? If he didn\u2019t want to go on a date with me? Didn\u2019t want to spend time with my friends and I? No!! Because I have a life and am an adult who doesn\u2019t have time to waste it for some dumb guy acting like he doesn\u2019t want to be with me. \n\nThe only good advice was working on yourself. You do not need a woman to be healthy, you do not need a woman to have hobbies and interests, you do not need a woman to be curious and intelligent, you do not need a woman to make sure you are financially secure. Being in a relationship is a matter of timing of the universe - two people have to meet and be attracted to each other but best case also have their shit together in some way. It\u2019s significantly harder to maintain any **healthy relationship** where you uplift each other when you aren\u2019t financially stable, unhealthy, don\u2019t love yourself, etc. \n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as \u201chigh value men\u201d to someone who is mentally & emotionally well. That makes relationships/partnerships completely transactional business deals where you are completely allowing someone else to determine your worth your entire life for the purpose of a date. What percent of men do you think is this fantasy and undefined \u201chigh value\u201d? 2%? 5%? We both know 90%+ of men in the world are not single & considered unlovable. And again what defines \u201chigh value\u201d? A man has a job and washes his ass? A laughably low bar. \n\nWatch out for people who talk like him, because they clearly buy and sell bullshit to people by mixing it with 1 sane message - which is work on yourself and value your self without needing another person to tell you you\u2019re worth something. That beloved person may never come. So make sure you\u2019re the best you can be without relying on someone else\u2019s validation. And if/when they do, you\u2019re secure enough to support each other in a healthy relationship.", "label": 0}

Take care of all the small things, hygiene, fitness, cleanliness.. up your style. Women care about all this, look how they invest in themselves, why would they settle for a sloppy Joe??\n\n4) show confidence and passion, in yourself and the things you care about! When you are confident in yourself, and passionate about what you do, this attracts people (this is the opposite side of the coin to item 1).\n\n5$ Don\u2019t become an incel, alpha dumbass.. these men are actually fronting.. they derive power by putting others down or believing they are below them.. this is a losing strategy. \n\n6) Do things and join things because you genuinely like or love those things, not as a way to attract people.\n\n7) Do get to know people for who they are and not for how they can satisfy your needs. People are fairly smart, and their intuition will read your intentions if they are disingenuous.\n\n8) stop looking for someone to save you, no one is coming, and no one person can do this but you. Build a tribe, love and be generous and genuine.. know when you\u2019re wrong and look for peace\n\n9) give it time, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, no relationships are.. don\u2019t let yourself get taken advantage of but it will take patience\n\n10) put yourself in vulnerable situations, where there are lots of women.. dance classes and yoga come to mind.. Zumba too, as ridiculous as this may seem.. it\u2019ll take time, but just be there and throw yourself into it, slowly you\u2019ll start making friends.. and be a friend.. don\u2019t be the creepy hyper-sexual dude.", "label": 0}

{"text": "You have to rationalize they're not goals for you.  They're people with their own goals and lives to live, and you being even in their lives at all is predicated on the privilege of being their friend first.\n\nWe're not entitled to friendship and love and care and intimacy.  We earn those things by being ourselves and accepting others as people being themselves, and connecting on a very fundamental level.  You should feel some sense of familial brotherhood with your best friend(s).  If you don't have this, start there.\n\nBeyond that, you should just go do stuff and stop looking at women as potential partners.  Go do stuff with guys and their girlfriends or wives in a group social setting like going bowling or something.  Pretend they're just men with other parts.  If you respect your friends and their partners, you won't see them as tokens to lust over.  If you treat women as people, they'll see you as a person, too, and you won't be nearly as intimidating to them and vice versa.  But that trust takes time to build and requires going in good faith and staying true to the positive virtues you have.\n\nNearly half my friends are women, and I'm single by choice for the time being.  They're great and I met them through hobbies and the intersection of social circles.  They know my passion for the hobbies is genuine, because our conversations heavily revolved around that early on and I never made any moves.  It's obvious to them when you're actually interacting with them as individuals in a shared space or not.\n\nI love these girls as platonic friends enough where I'm satisfied with them being in my life as they are.  Start there.  Make friends first.  Many are just like men but with different body parts.  And if you have nothing in common, that's okay too, as you know there's nothing to really pursue in terms of deep friendship, but you can still be acquaintances, and maybe some activity sees you having something in common later in life.

Like I said, focus on friends to be friends. Not for something more. When you stop searching, that is when you find the one.\n\n#3 You are going to go through the worst relationship you have ever had, before you find the one. This person is going to break you, force you to stop. It's when you stop looking when you find it. And I do mean the worst. The two of you will see sides of yourself that you will hate and don't want and that is how you know you don't want that in a relationship. And I don't mean puppy love and your heart feels broken. I mean you are so discouraged from this relationship, you swear relationships off altogether. You say, I will never ever date again. For me, my last relationship before the one mentally abused me and then cute stuffed animals open with scissors and left the stuffing around the house. Like worst relationship.\n\nYou will find your person and they will come into your life when you need them. Never when you are searching for them.

{"text": "> Thats very sad, if this is the meaning of a plan for you. \n\nThat's part joke, and part reality. I've learned that for me, plans need to be either painted with the broadest brush possible, allowing for significant flexibility. Often my plan is literally \"just wing it\". Other times, a plan needs to be meticulously planned, with contingencies, backups, and what-ifs. And if that's what the plan is... then the plan will never be ready, and so I'll never get *started* on the plan until its perfect.\n\n> For example one goal of mine is to be healthy. So i set up a workout-plan, which im doing consitantly, I am cooking at least 2times a week (healthy) and learn at least one new recipe every month. I have set up a plan for flexibility training and all of that for one goal, to be healthy and it is working just perfectly fine.\n\nGood for you. You just described something that *works for you* but not everyone is you. You're not the first person to tell people with ADHD \"just have a plan, stick to it! write it down. Make a schedule. Do all these things are proven to work! They work for me! If its important to you, you won't forget!\" I think you're getting pushback because advice like that is annoying to hear over and over again, as if no one has ever tried it before. And when it doesn't work, its because *we* are at fault and wrong and stupid or whatever.\n\nWe've learned, through our own years of experience, many things that don't work for us. \n\n>  And for some reason people here think, its not possible with ADHD.. well i have it since a young lad plus i have restlessleg-syndrom and sleeping problems... still no excuses. The fact people here argue against me to prove that they have no way of winning and achieving is showing me, how much they want to be the victim somehow.. maybe because its easier that way.\n\nI will agree with you on this. To your point, there is a vocal subset that embrace a victim mentality who are unable to see any \"silver lining\". Some reject the idea that \"hyperfocus\" has any good side, or recognize that study after study shows that people with ADHD are often creative problem solvers, often perform better than others in high pressure and dynamic situations. Instead, they spiral into \"support\" communities where they get the emotional validation and reinforcement they need, where someone's not-completely-negative experience is just \"toxic positivity\" that pierce their bubble, and so seem to be rejected. (and some of that is due to the nature of ADHD itself, which lends itself to negative rumination)\n\nI know that there are people who are struggling in various parts of their life, some of those have ADHD, which  definitely has an impact on that. And I also know that for people with ADHD, you'll also find many on the autism spectrum, and/or dealing with depression or other mental health issues. They're all related. It's not easy to live like this; its such a complicated thing, its very hard to capture the spiderweb of \"bonus features\" we have and how it impacts our lives, and the lives of people we love.\n\nI wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until well into my 40s, deep into a career I deeply love and excel at. I didn't mean to (remember, no real goal or plan), but I have accomplished a lot that I'm proud of and I'm very happy where I am. *for me*, the diagnosis made a lot of things throughout my life make sense. Many of the the things I'm strongest with, and am weakest with, are common experiences for others with ADHD. I still struggle, but I'm always trying to minimize the blast radius, and keep getting better. But I recognize that my path isn't universal. I reconize the struggle that others have; I don't like the rejection of any attempt to re-frame something in a more positive light that can help self confidence and attitude.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Since you mentioned wanting to go abroad, I wanted to pitch in with this comment. What you are unable to fix today you cannot fix by going to another place. It might seem like a new adventure where exciting things happen and you will suddenly get motivation, but reality is not that. It might seem like an escape, going from one place to next, but you can't run away from yourself. If you can face yourself today, it won't matter where you are, you can face yourself tomorrow too. Become better today, so the better you can step into any country with confidence. \n\nMoving and settling in a new country has its own challenges and on top of it, you'll add loneliness until you make new friends and get a circle of your own. New situation takes time and more willpower than being in current situation, whatever it is. \n\nHence look at what you have today that you appreciate, cherish and can improve on, and then look at what small steps you can take towards that dreams/goals of yours.\n\nWhen I mean steps, am talking of slow consistent habits and actions that will seem small but help with your future goals. \n\nSome such examples are:  \n\n1. Can you save some small amount month on month into a new account which you can use to do something for yourself - it could be for travel,  or for a consultation with immigration folks, or for doing a new course that's more in demand both in India and abroad. \n\n2. Try to find a friend or someone who you trust who can do things with you, or help keep you on track - be it on goals you want to achieve or who can join you for a walk or for a chat (if online) etc. \n\n3. Do you think staying stay with some friends, away from family will help you find new hobbies, like cooking and managing your time and chores - which will again help in the long run when you move abroad where you need to take care of your own stuffs.. \n\n4. How about joining any meetup/volunteering groups etc that helps improve self-confidence and gives you a sense of accomplishment through attending and helping others? This will then be a good way to make new friends and do similar activities when you move abroad.\n\nEach of these examples may seem like a lot but I hope something inside of it could be used as a starting point. \n\nTake care of yourself.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Confidence is developed from being able to connect to a series of successes and challenges overcome or even just passably getting through. \n\nWe sometimes struggle to remember/connect or to reframe what we\u2019ve been through as something we\u2019ve overcome. But once we do, it can empower us to make more change in our lives because it doesn\u2019t trap us in a box of self fulfilling prophecies about our lack of confidence and capability. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know why something is challenging (like dealing with depression) to know it\u2019s challenging. You do need to remember that you are doing everything you can to cope with it. And once you can fully acknowledge/feel that you are doing the best you can, then you can start trying to use that self assurance to also take small but meaningful next steps towards learning what you need to resolve in your life to get better while making sure you keep up with at least 1 skill to help fuel your confidence when things get hard down the road. Complex habits (like music using many different parts of your body and mind simultaneously) is definitely challenging and makes it harder to start, but it\u2019s more rewarding in the long term. Ultimately, any creative habits would be ideal to engage multiple parts of yourself. But, you can\u2019t take on a habit if you don\u2019t have enough motivation to start building a connection to the habit. That\u2019s where a profound understanding of the validity of your struggles is important. \n\nAlso, keep yourself open to everything you see and hear to potentially learn from it rather than shutting it out. \n\nLastly, the habit is something you need to be comfortable making it a life long journey. Or, at least a journey long enough for you to get what you need out of it enough that you can start switching it for a new habit which would be challenging to start from scratch. \n\nBest of luck to everyone.", "label": 0}

I find that starting off slow helps.\u00a0\n\nMy story: Back in mid July of this year I noticed that my resting heart rate was 15bpm above normal. \u00a0I got scared and went to see the doctor. \u00a0Nothing was wrong, heart was healthy. I had a cold a few days before and your body sometimes does this to get white blood cells faster to where they need to go. This motivated me to get my health better. I have kids and I want to be active and healthy for them. So I decided I'd start exercising. \u00a0\n\nOld me would have started going to the gym for a few hours a day and training to run marathons, but I decided to take it easy. \u00a0I started off with a walk around the block. That soon became two and then I took a different path through my neighborhood and that became a couple miles of walking, enjoying nature. Before I knew it I was running, and was running about 3 miles a day.\u00a0\n\nRecently I stopped running... but only because I started JiuJitsu and it requires different types of cardio exercise, so been doing some faster paced cardio thats more for for this.\u00a0\u00a0 Rolling (sparring) is very demanding and running isn't cutting it. I hate lifting weights but I've slowly been incorporating them because strength helps and more muscle protects your joints.\u00a0\n\nOn top of all this I've been on a calorie deficit and been eating more protein. Since I started my journey I've lost 20lbs. I look better, I feel better and I actually enjoy working out and look forward to it. \u00a0 At the same time I've tried to stay off social media and doomscrolling in general. It's been great for my mental health and anxiety.\u00a0\n\nSo all this to say take your time and take baby steps. Motivation will come but it can take time. But you have to start with that first step. Don't make it a leap.\u00a0", "label": 0}

You can do everything right and not achieve goals like these because of factors outside of your control. What helped me was making intrinsic goals based on the kind of person I wanted to be.\n\nFor example, in order to make the money I wanted to make, I needed to get a job. To get that job, I needed to have a certain skillset. I made getting that skillset my goal, since my learning is something I control holistically.\n\nI approach my life this way now. I\u2019ve identified virtues that are important to me and I take 15 minutes daily as a \u201cmeditation\u201d to ensure my behaviors matched my ideals. If they don\u2019t, I consciously adjust my behaviors until they become habit. \n\nThis will put you in a direction in life that you will meet others on. You will recognize their path in their moral journey and it will be far easier to see eye to eye when you have your values defined. The people further ahead of you can take on a mentor role, those behind can be mentees. Those in a similar place are your colleagues and you encourage their growth alongside yourself.\n\nYou are distracted by comparing yourself to others, or what you could have if you had done x. Extrinsic comparison like this will rob your life of joy. Instead, wire your mind to compete against the past version of you.

If you are still feeling that way after a month, you may not be engaging yourself enough to stay occupied. Find both mental and physical hobbies you enjoy, weed can make anything enjoyable so now you need to find what you personally enjoy. It can be hard but it will also improve your energy, depression, and motivation to do things. It should also correct sleep problems from the insomnia quitting weed can cause. If you still feel down at that point, you may need to talk to a psychologist for possible depressive issues. I didn't use them, but there are hotlines that can help you quit weed (supposedly) that may help in the transition.

{"text": "Started smoking at 18 with a really shitty past and a really bright future. Ended up stalling out after a couple years of regular use and let myself fizzle and fade into a boring shell of who I was. Ended up completely stagnant in life. 34 now. Haven't smoked in over 6 months and I'm actually coming out of the haze and putting my life back together for the first time in so damn long. Literally have an engineering degree from a good school with good grades and chose to get baked and deliver pizzas the last 10 years instead of using it. Filled out my first job applications last month since college. Hit up all my old friends. Started working out and going to social events again. Weed itself isn't evil, but if you want to hide from yourself and your life, it really let's you pull the shades down over your eyes. Took 6 weeks before I could sleep more than 2 hours a night. Took like 5 months for the cravings to stop. I've taken longer breaks than this before, and then I went back to it. That's why it feels a lot easier for me to not want to go back to it this time.. just knowing it really doesn't add anything to my life. Ever see The Matrix? Neo asks why his eyes hurt and they tell him it's because he's using them for the first time. You're whole freakin soul/existence is going to hurt for a bit while you relearn how to do everything and enjoy stuff again. Read, run, hike, lift, study, avoid the people you smoke with all the time (hardest part), go watch some sunrises and sunsets alone. You're desensitized to life because you were constantly stimulated. That all comes back. Just focus on what you want from yourself and your life. I spend way too much time thinking about what could have been and how I wish I could get some of that time back. But I can't. I can either let my past ruin my present or I can use my present to improve my future. We live in a time where we have so very much and live so well. It's easy to take those things for granted and let them become background noise. Just live a small life and be grateful for all the little things. I have friends that have very easy lives and some that didn't make it to 30. You never know what could have been or what will be. Maybe this is happening to you for a reason. Maybe your time as a stoner will make you have a conversation that sticks with your kid and makes them decide to never try hard drugs some day. Best advice I has is go through the motions on improving your daily habits and life in general until they become your new norm. After a while it stops feeling empty and you realize you're growing into someone you love and falling in love with who you are again is a really kick ass reward for getting through it all.
