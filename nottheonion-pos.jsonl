Eliminating the Dept of Ed, combined with plans to weaken labor organizing and worker protections while strengthening vouchers and private schools plus restricting what teachers can talk about in the classroom will be the death knell of public schools as we know them. States will get less or no money from the federal gov, and in turn funding for public schools will fail. Teachers will be laid off or vacancies not filled. Those that remain will face strict rules about their content and what they can say/teach.\n\nClass sizes will increase, and teachers will be given pre-packaged approved curricula to administer, making it possible to hire less qualified teachers and reduce salaries across the board. The quality of education in public schools will fail, justifying the claims on the right that public schools suck and charters/private schools are the best option. Eventually, wealthy parents will pull their children out of public schools ensuring that the elite still have access to quality education (or indoctrination depending on the parents' ideologies), while the masses (who will also be disproportionately people of color) will be stuck at public schools that do nothing more than prepare them to be compliant workers in low wage jobs.

{"text": "No. Nothing of what I said was blatantly false. Rather I presented *some* positive traits from Trump and cut out the nuance from the rest while painting them in a positive light, while either only presenting negative traits from Kamala and cut out the nuance from the rest while painting them in a negative light. Essentially, I presented factual information in a heavily biased manner.\n\n\nThat is **exactly** what the document is doing. The fact that you failed to see that is hilarious because it points out that you are unable to see past your own bias.\n\nTo back up the things I mentioned, here is a breakdown of the actual information without bias:\n\n\n- Kamala does want to raise taxes, but for the rich as well as corporations. Trump on the other hand wants to introduce tax cuts for corporations and the rich. Kamala believes that, among other things, this will put more spending power on the federal government for things that directly benefit the people and economy. Trump on the other hand believes that, among other things, this will help bring in more jobs.\n\n- [Kamala is expected](https://kpmg.com/us/en/taxnewsflash/news/2024/09/tnf-kpmg-report-us-trade-policy-under-presidential-candidates-comparative-review.html) to more or less maintain the current trade policies of the current admin. We'll have to see how things play out throughout her admin though. Trump repeatedly mentioned how he wants to bring factories into the US and rely less on imports.\n\n- [Both Trump and Kamala](https://www.thealbertan.com/lifestyle/trump-and-harris-both-support-a-bigger-child-tax-credit-but-which-families-should-get-it-9740767) are in favor of increasing child tax credit. Trump previously did so in his admin, and intends to do it again. Kamala of course will be no different and wants to raise tax credit. While Trump did increase the ceiling for eligibility based on income, Kamala has previous proposed eliminating it all together.\n\n- [Kamala was district attorney](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-evolution-of-harris-stances-on-key-issues-from-the-death-penalty-to-marijuana) in California, and oversaw several cases and convictions related to marijuana. Trump's entry into politics was mainly the presidency. He has no record of overseeing criminal and civil courts as that was never his direct responsibility. Kamala has expressed wanting to decriminalize marijuana federally, while Trump during his admin was in favor of restricting access to it and keeping it illegal.\n\n- I believe I was mistaken on the voter ID one. I don't think it was her that called them racist, but rather members of the democratic party. So I would rephrase it as \"Members of the party she is representing say voter ID laws are racist\". Trump wants voter ID laws because he believes several people who are not legible to vote are slipping through the cracks. The argument is that it would help maintain election integrity. Kamala and the democratic party [are against these laws](https://people.com/politics/kamala-harris-pushes-back-on-voter-id-laws-makes-it-almost-impossible/) however, believes that those laws would make it harder for people to vote, resulting in a very restrictive election that harms the ability for people to vote, especially those in rural areas.\n\n- Crimes committed by immigrants under the Biden admin have been making the rounds in the media in the past year. It has become a major and controversial topic. However, Kamala has not been the president overseeing this, and many efforts made by the Biden admin to address the issue on immigration has been oddly enough met with resistance by republicans in congress. However Biden, with Kamala as VP, has been reluctant to use executive action to go around congress and address the problem head on, contrasting himself with Trump. [He eventually gave in this year](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-administration-weighs-executive-action-border-migrants-rcna137804) and [did use some of his executive power](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-executive-order-immigration-06-04-24/index.html) after congress failed to do much. Trump on the other hand wants to address the problem head on with executive action, however he has a poor track record because in his previous admin, several migrants were placed in inhumane conditions under his watch. Many kids died while others went missing or were separated from their families.\n\n- [Kamala has previously been angry](https://x.com/theblaze/status/1819127146604122156) about people saying \"merry christmas\", but the context is that she was making remarks over the inhumane migrant conditions that were occurring under Trump. She was not speaking in a literal sense.", "label": 1}

Push for immigration, turns out a lot of current immigrants don't want people to come after them, and are actually pretty conservative and don't care if you are the one who let them into the country in the first place.\n\nI think the best example is when Roy Moore was running for Senate in Alabama, a disbarred accused pedophile, the whole Republican party gave him full throated support. Curiously at exactly the same time, Al Franken was accused of inappropriate touching and was immediately forced out of the Senate by the Democratic party.\n\ntl;dr I agree dems suck at messaging for how much smarter they pretend to be.
