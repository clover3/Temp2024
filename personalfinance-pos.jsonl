{"text": "It sounds like your new JPMC card\u2019s limit hasn\u2019t been reported to Experian yet, which is why your utilization is showing at 100%. This can happen because sometimes new accounts, especially new credit limits, can take a billing cycle or two to appear on your credit report.\n\nHere\u2019s what likely happened:\n\n1. **Timing of Reporting:** Credit card companies usually report balances and limits to the credit bureaus at the end of each billing cycle. Since the JPMC card is new, its information may just not have been updated in Experian\u2019s records yet.\n2. **Credit Utilization Calculation:** Right now, since only the Discover card limit is being considered, the $1800 on the JPMC card is making your utilization look higher than it actually is.\n3. **Expected Update:** Once JPMC reports to Experian (often within 30 days of your first billing cycle), your total available credit should reflect that additional $20k limit. This will reduce your overall credit utilization, which could help your score bounce back.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s likely just a matter of waiting for the credit report to catch up with your new account information. If you still don\u2019t see the update by the next billing cycle, it might be worth checking in with JPMC to ensure they\u2019re reporting to Experian.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Man I have so much to say on this. I had no idea what depression or anxiety was like growing up . I had an amazing childhood and high school experience and was super extroverted and had so many friends. Didn\u2019t even know what it was like to be in my own head and overthink. All that flipped and did a complete 180 when I turned 19/20 in college. I was a heavy weed smoker throughout high school and one day my arm started to go numb and I would bug out every time I smoked. I became super self aware and my mentality changed. I was really withdrawn, always felt awkward and got really depressed. \n\nYou can dm me and we can talk more but I struggled for so many years mentally, you can turn it around I promise.\n\nThe keys are this: \n\n1. Cut out weed/ nicotine/insert drug here. I would defend my weed usage and claim it helps my stress and anxiety. Cap. That\u2019s an illusion and until your without it for an extended period of time you won\u2019t realize it . Also terrible for REM sleep and disrupts recovery. \n\n2. Fix your diet. Cut out processed foods and eat Whole Foods. Research a general meal plan of healthy things to eat and stick to it. \n\n3. Fix your sleep schedule. I would stay up till 4-5 am playing video games or watching YouTube and I could never fix my schedule for more than a week. Pull an all nighter and go outside in the morning at the time you want to wake up and get sunlight in your eyes for five minutes. Do not sleep until night time and get up  at the same time everyday. You will reset your circadian rhythm and this does wonders hormonally.\n\n4. You have to exercise. Get into lifting, I don\u2019t care what anyone says. I mean really learn about it and pick a plan. Start slow. I know there are many ways to exercise that are great but lifting weights sprinkled in with some light cardio throughout the week is the absolute best thing you can do and is the top thing I credit for changing my life. Before you start lifting weights, I recommend starting with walking and pick a mobility routine to really open and realign your body. Do this for 2-3 weeks then start going to the gym and do some mobility every once in a while to stay loose. \n\n5. Spend time in nature. You can go for hike as your cardio or simply walk in the woods, just get out in nature. Ideally 1-2 times a week, but I know it\u2019s tough. I hardly do it anymore, life gets in the way. But at the beginning when I was really going through it, this helped me so much. \n\n6. Meditate. In through the nose out through the mouth slowly. Not guided, just you and your breath. Outside is my favorite but find what\u2019s best for you. Thoughts will enter your mind just let them float by and if you get distracted bring yourself back to your breath. 15-30 min a day. Another thing that really helped me at my lowest point and something I need to get back to doing.\n\n7. Don\u2019t watch porn. Look up yourbrainonporn. Easy dopamine shortcut. Too easy.\n\n8. This is going to be controversial. Cut out video games if you cant limit it to a couple of hours a week .I love gaming so much , played since the ps1 days. It was my escape and that was the problem. It still hurts having given it up lol and I can\u2019t say I won\u2019t ever go back but I couldn\u2019t control how much I played. I avoided so many problems in life and just found comfort in video games. \n\n9. I\u2019m gonna combine a few extra points here, find a hobby you love, cut out toxic people from your life, when your faced with a challenge and want to turn away, whatever it may be, FORCE yourself to push through it. It builds character and good things are on the other side of adversity.  Face your problems head on , no more running away or making excuses.\n\n10. Love yourself , you can do anything you put your mind to.\n\nSorry for the length but I hope this helps anyone reading this who is struggling. I pulled myself out of a pit and you can too.", "label": 1}

The effect on score is mostly temporary.

{"text": "There's a few different categories covered by what you're asking.\n\nFirst is \"fund\" (probably meaning \"mutual fund\") vs. ETF.  Both are essentially ways to aggregate up more basic financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc.).  That aggregate becomes it's own financial asset that can be divided up into shares which get bought/sold.  The difference is in how those new shares get traded.  Mutual funds (an older product type) get priced at the end of each market trading day based on the value of the \"stuff\" it bundled up, and trades occur only at that time.  ETFs trade *during* the market day more-or-less the same as stocks.  This can cause the ETF's share value to drift from the underlying value (due to how buy/sell order requests are managed), but there are mechanisms to correct for that.  \n\nMutual funds can always be purchased in fractional share amounts.  So if you have $100 to invest and the fund is trading for $125, you get 0.8 of a share.  ETFs are usually only traded in full-share amounts, but some ETFs at some brokerages allow for fractional trading.  This difference also tends to mean that any \"automatic investment\" you want to set up (brokerage pulls in $X from your bank account on a defined schedule to buy selected funds) is only offered for mutual funds.  \n\nThen there are \"index\" funds.  This describes what goes into a given fund's basket of assets, and can be part of the design of either a mutual fund or ETF.  Following an index offloads a lot of the decisions that go into a managed fund (where a person picks stuff), making them a lower-cost product.  There are many indexes that can be used to design a mutual fund / ETF.  \"S&P 500\" is one, that's a collection of the 500 biggest US companies, and the holdings are weighted by company size.  Each brokerage can build their own version of a fund, and if two use the same index the overall performance of those will be identical.  Or close enough, one may use slightly different weightings of the holdings, another may charge more fees, etc.\n\nVTI is a \"Total Market Index\" ETF, intended to track the entire US stock market.  That means the stuff in its holdings is more than just the S&P, though given the size of those companies and weighting methods, the S&P is a really big chunk of that total market.  \n\nThose kind of things tie into the concept of \"diversification\".  Picking a single company stock expecting it to do well is risky.  Picking a bunch of companies (in different sectors, different sizes, even different companies) means that you have a better chance of your overall \"winners\" outweighing \"losers\".  Mutual funds (and later ETFs) are a way financial companies have offered to simplify that \"bunch of companies\" selections.  The more stuff covered within the fund, the more diversification you tend to have.  So by that standard, VTI is more diversified than something solely holding the S&P 500.  One of those non-S&P companies might end up being the next Apple or Amazon and get you good returns.  The drawback is that including \"bad\" companies acts as a drag against your returns vs. having something focused only on \"good\" companies.  But identifying good vs. bad ahead of time is practically impossible.  So you accept that lower net return in trade for (at least hopefully) more reliable growth.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm a financial planner, but not your financial planner. I love doing these types of analysis!\n\nBased on what you've shared, it sounds like you're in a strong financial position with a high income, significant retirement savings, and minimal debt. It's awesome that your kids will graduate debt-free, and that you're planning to retire soon. But here's why you might still want to consider maintaining some life insurance coverage.\n\n1. Life Insurance Isn't Just About lncome Replacement Anymore\n\n Most people think of life insurance purely as a way to replace income, especially for those with dependents. But life insurance can also serve as a financial bridge for other things like ensuring your spouse has extra financial security or providing liquidity for any unexpected expenses. For example, if something happened to you right after retirement, your spouse would suddenly lose access to your work benefits (like employer-provided life insurance) and the income you're used to making together. This could be a big shock financially, even with savings.\n\n2. Protecting Against Market Volatility in Retirement\n\nWhen you retire, you'll likely start drawing on your 401(k) and other investments. If the market takes a downturn just as you start retirement (think 2008 or 2020), withdrawing from those accounts could deplete your savings faster than expected. Life insurance can act as a safety net, covering any immediate needs without having to dip into investments during a bad market. Essentially, it can help you manage risk and preserve your retirement assets.\n\n3. Long-Term Care Costs and Health-Related Expenses\n\nHealth and long-term care expenses are one of the biggest financial risks retirees face. Life insurance with a long-term care or chronic illness rider can provide funds for care, taking the burden off your spouse or family if you need support later. Having a small policy could allow you to avoid tapping into your main savings or retirement funds if unexpected health costs come up.\n\n4. Leaving a Legacy or Financial Cushion for Your Spouse\n\nWhile your kids are nearly independent, your spouse may still benefit from a financial cushion in case of an untimely death, especially in early retirement. Even if you have substantial retirement savings, a small policy can cover final expenses, remaining mortgage payments, and ensure your spouse isn't forced to make difficult financial choices too soon after losing a partner.\n\nSo, are you 'crazy\" to extend your policy? Not at all! Life insurance at this stage can provide flexibility, protection against risks, and peace of mind as you enter retirement. Even a modest amount can make a big difference, not just for income replacement, but for many of the other challenges retirees face. Consider a smaller, affordable policy, or look into options that provide living benefits like a chronic illness rider. That way, you're protecting your spouse and retirement assets without over-insuring or Over-spending.\n\nOh and don't do term policies ever unless you are early in getting life insurance and are just trying to save your health rating. Only the life insurance companies \"win\" when people but term. Less than 2% of term policies pay.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm curious, how would you consider this ChatGPT advice?\n\n---\n\nThis couple has a solid income baseline of $4,500 per month, which is sufficient for a monthly mortgage of $1,500. With their $300,000 in savings and a desire for long-term security, here are some ways they could approach a home purchase:\n\n1. Calculate Affordability Range Based on Payment Goals\nAiming for a $1,500 monthly mortgage payment allows for a loan amount around $225,000\u2013$250,000. This amount assumes a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 7% interest rate (as of recent averages). However, rates vary, so checking current options could yield different results.\nAdding a down payment would increase their purchasing power, potentially allowing them to buy a home in the $275,000\u2013$300,000 range while keeping monthly payments manageable.\n2. Consider Down Payment Amounts\n3.5% Down (FHA Loan): This keeps more cash on hand for emergencies or investments, requiring only about $10,500 on a $300,000 home. The tradeoff, however, is higher monthly payments and added mortgage insurance premiums, which can make budgeting tighter in the long run.\n20% Down (Conventional Loan): A 20% down payment eliminates mortgage insurance, reduces monthly costs, and increases equity, which can be a comfort at retirement age. This would require around $60,000 on a $300,000 home, leaving them with a solid $240,000 cushion.\nHigher Down Payment (30% or More): They might consider increasing the down payment to reduce monthly mortgage costs further. For example, a $90,000 down payment (30%) brings the loan down to $210,000, potentially lowering monthly payments below $1,500 and accelerating their timeline to be mortgage-free.\n3. Emergency Fund & Remaining Savings\nIt\u2019s essential to leave sufficient funds for emergencies, ideally maintaining $100,000\u2013$150,000 in savings. This provides a buffer for unexpected expenses or if their income decreases.\n4. Mortgage Term & Interest Rates\nThey could consider a 15- or 20-year mortgage, which would increase the monthly payments but allow them to pay off the home sooner. However, if maximizing monthly cash flow is more important, a 30-year mortgage with prepayments when possible is a flexible choice.\n5. Loan Qualification & Stability Concerns\nGiven the goal of stability, going for a conventional loan with a significant down payment, such as 20%, could help them secure lower payments while maintaining liquidity. Buying a modest home they can comfortably afford at $275,000\u2013$300,000 with 20% down would align with their goals and allow for flexibility with their monthly income.\nIn summary:\n\nHome Price Range: $275,000\u2013$300,000.\nDown Payment: 20% ($55,000\u2013$60,000).\nRemaining Savings: Approximately $240,000, ensuring a strong safety net.\nMortgage Goal: Keep the payment close to $1,500 with a 30-year loan, and make extra payments when possible to achieve their goal of financial security in retirement.", "label": 1}

Tires wear out, accidents happen, animals get sick...\nBut also, don't view emergency money as a funds store for fun stuff.\u00a0\n\n\nI specifically put mine in an account that takes about 3 days to transfer back to my main account. I can't use it without effort.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2. This one is debatable but it worked for me....\n\n\nI opened a new credit card any time it had a 0% transfer offer. I would transfer the debt to that card and then work with the 0% interest to pay it off faster.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe thing here is to immediately box up or cut up that card and not use it. For all intents and purposes, that new card is a loan and not a line of credit. The transfer has an initial fee but over the course of the 12-18 month period of 0% interest, it'll be worth it.\u00a0\n\n\nI would have thought opening endless cards over the course of several years would have impacted my credit negatively but it actually made it better each time. You get a hard inquiry but I opened a new card only when the 0% interest ran out so they were space at least a year apart.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause I wasn't adding debt to the old or the new card, it was increasing my line of credit capacity which reduced my use ratio.\u00a0\n\n\nThat Apple card has a crazy interest rate, focus on offboarding or paying that off first.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThese two things can help but you have to break the habit of relying on your cards for purchases or emergencies first. You know this but remember habits are not light switches. It's not an off or on switch - it's daily decisions creating expectations. You have to make the choice everyday to not fall back into bad spending.\u00a0\n\n\nI know you're overwhelmed. It takes time to get where you are and time to get back out.

{"text": "#1 is very much not true. Every bank is a separate inquiry. While a small number of inquiries (3 or 4ish) is expected, as they number climbs so too does your rate. Banks do care about how much you are shopping around, there\u2019s a correlation between high inquiries and risk. \n\nThey will consider things like are you opening a second auto loan they don\u2019t know about, did you get rejected by other banks, etc. Even pristine credit will see incremental rate increased as inquiries rise.\n\nThe rule of thumb is if a bank can use something to increase your rate, even marginally, they will.

Do the math yourself, but in my experience, the people who come out on top barely come out on top (you save a few hundred if you only get a couple cleanings and a filling or two), but a lot of people are in a situation like yours because dental insurance pays less and less the more you need it (contrary to say, most other insurance products). Further, the benefits are capped instead of your out-of-pocket max.\n\nOh yeah, and if it's 'cosmetic' ... eff you. They also don't cover 'extras' like 3d imaging, sedation, etc.\n\nDid I mention many plans make you wait a year for serious work and 3 months or more for less serious work.", "label": 1}
