You think it was luck to take this idea that was well established for well over a decade and put it in a mobile app and give everybody access to it? You have definitely been huffing gas....\n\n\nNo one gives a crap that the game isn't catering to your individual tastes, tens of millions of people play this game every hour all over the world. They measure their profits in billions, something that many countries around the world can't claim. You and your small minority don't like it? Oh well, the rest of us do so kick rocks \ud83e\udd23\n\nOh was there a feature that was buggy for a little while And you thought it should be perfect? Can you name one video game that isn't buggy at all for anyone? Go ahead. I'll wait.... That has never happened in the history of gaming, all games have some kind of bug or inconsistency or problem and the fact that this game is played all around the world by literally hundreds of millions of people and it works for Soo many different languages, software and hardware differences is a miracle. Have you produced anything even slightly on par with what this is doing? You sound like a spoiled baby who has no idea how video games or even societal rules work. \n\n\nOh, you have to actually go outside and interact with other people and the world in the game whose primary focus is to get you to go outside and interact with other people and the world? Shocking!  I don't know what game you're playing or what tools you're using but You are not playing the game as it's intended to be played, nor are you supposed to be using those tools that are allowing you to fly wherever or trade wherever or do whatever the heck it is you think you should be doing. If you don't like the game as is, stop playing it, go play something else or go do your bug catching, but don't think that you speak for the hundreds of millions of other players that enjoy the game, nor should the company that owns it, invests in it, and puts their love and care into it should listen to anything YOU who does nothing to contribute anything meaningful to the development and continuation of the game has to say.\n\n\nStop huffing gas...", "label": 1}

They also wanted ways to get people to go out and interact with each other somewhere near levels that they used to years ago and that's also what this feature is doing. I understand this, you have lacking comprehension skills.\n\n\nYou don't like it, too bad, don't use the feature just like millions of people don't use a lot of the features in the game and still play (There are people that don't battle or don't do raids or don't trade or don't do routes, etc) And enjoy themselves.

{"text": "G-max battles really killed my community's interest. The beginning max battles? No one wanted to do them, nor did they want to invest into ANOTHER Charizard that they already have mega and level 50. Beldum came out and my community was just uninterested cause we just had community day and they have shinies + we managed to communicate a hundo in the area for multiple players to get. \n\nSo falinks came around and players tried to solo him just like beldum but couldn't. So they just didn't do any. Even during raid hour meet ups, no one wanted to do a falinks since we just had a raid day of him.\n\nThen G-max came around. We could not get a single player to have interest in them because they saw how difficult they were online. It also turned out, I was the only player out of our 40 player group to even grind and level up my Dmax pokemon. We even tried to get spoofers in our area to help but even they refused to attempt them. \n\nWhen Gengar came around, I wanted him so bad. I really wanted a shiny Gmax to be my mega and Gmax. With the added talk about the lowered difficulty, it actually ignited a little interest and had several players come out to try. We had a 15 player group on halloween, and the best we could do was half health. Players in our area left to go to other towns and join meetups there because we could not do them. \n\nIt's honestly saddening. I just got back into the game and have been playing for a year. Sword and Shield was also the game i returned to the series with. To see dynamax in Pogo be such a bad feature is disheartening. Weird to see my community can 6 man a mega rayquaza, but a Gmax gengar is too much for us. Now we have all these max dens in my area that no one can participate in. \n\nI might need to see another difficulty decrease before my community attempts them again. I don't think anyone in my community cares much for toxtricity here soon. Until then can Niantic give us the ability to hide max battle dens? They're kind of getting in the way of pokemon and stops i wanna catch/spin.", "label": 1}
