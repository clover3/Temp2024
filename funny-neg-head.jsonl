I visited friends I hadn't seen since high school. I spent time with my elderly childhood dog and took her on hikes. I wrote a short story. I learned how to properly cook. I watched tv shows I'd never gotten around to seeing. I joined a recreational soccer league. I started volunteering to teach adults to read. I picked up drawing again. I got really good at crossword puzzles. And after the two years were up, I wasn't remotely bored. And there were still TONS of things I wanted to do.\n\nI think a lot of people think they'll be bored without \"work\" because they equate not working with not doing anything...

While it'll be more expensive after fees, it's pretty much right in line with inflation, especially considering the band is big enough to sell out NBA arenas now.\n\nI go to tons of concerts every year, and I generally find prices to get in aren't terribly expensive. My usual show is priced at about $35 before fees for a general admission experience where you can get right up to the front if you want. It's not unusual for me to spend more on beers at the venue than tickets (three beers will set you back $50). \n\nTicket prices can get absurd for pop acts like Taylor Swift, but rock/metal prices are still pretty reasonable.

{"text": "Sure but a job for a single person means freedom. You make your own money and spend it how you want. I didnt ever consider college, i was working literally since i could find ways to make money. By 17 i had a 10 hour a day job, 5-7 days a week. I loved it. I got a serious girlfiend and found a much better job at 40/week and all these jobs totally sucked, as expected, and i wasnt some super employee by any means, i just dont look at it *only* in those terms - for one thing, since you dont have a choice youre just making yourself more miserable. In my life ive felt a lot of freedom to seek out work and environments i liked, much less after starting a family, so dont do that until youre confident and comfortable where youre at with a trade or profession.\n\nThe thing is, what are the potential alternatives? Look elsewhere in the world and tell me unequivocally who (working/middle class at best) have it better than Americans in general? There are definitely similar options elsewhere but i dont think anyone can really say rhe average norwegian or French has it better - in terms of working to live. I make no excuses for our state of healthcare, or any perceived governmental issues we may share. \n\nAnd before that? Some people like subsistence living but 99.999% of us arent cut out to prefer it. In all reality if youre in america it\u2019s not a stretch to try it if you have any romantic notions about it. All over rhe us you can find cheap, remote, even gorgeous parcels of land you can buy for cash with a single tax return or a few months saved income depending on your budget. \n\nChickens, chicks anyway, are cheap, sometimes free. Go get you some tools and drive out there and build yourself that lean to or cabin or A frame, raise chickens, get a goat, make your cheese and soap, grow some grain for your animals and plan your seasonal crop for youself. Rely on cheap solar or just daylight if youre so inclined. You might love it, but it\u2019s more likely youll feel differently about a measly 40 hours (if 40 hours gets you some level of comfort and privacy). \n\nDoesnt mean you have to thank your bosses or tolerate corporate greed dispassionately, just means this is the reality we\u2019re in and it serves everyone to recognize the shortcomings but it doesnt serve you to only focus on them.", "label": 0}
