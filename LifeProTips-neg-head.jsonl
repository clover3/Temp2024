My first instinct at my age and previous experiences is to drop him. BUT I have had friendships that have weathered the storm of the dynamic changing.\n\n\nIt can be a few things.\n\n\nOne, he could be envious that your life is better and you no longer need them. Their petty comments may be them trying to show their value in your lives. That could potentially be fixed. This isn't quite envy of your life, but more operating out of fear that you will move past them. That's fixable! The friendship can be saved.\n\n\nTwo, you are progressing beyond them and they are struggling with resentment and jealously. It hurts, it *really* hurts when friends change up on you when your life improves. The only reason I am trying to be gracious is because I have had two people at different points in my life come and apologize and that's the reason they gave. It didn't make me feel better tbh. I was fresh and green and struggling. They were my cheerleaders. And I well...kinda went above what they expected is all I will say. That changed things. The apologies were nice, but it hurt because the way it was delivered was that I made them feel bad about themselves. So I questioned and spiraled on why they were my friend in the first place? To take a charity project? Pity? To have someone beneath them. I don't think that was the case, but just honest thoughts that made it harder to trust people.\u00a0\n\n\nI almost wish I never knew and just moved on and made different friends. So asking is to risk facing honest truths. About them...and about what you secretly think about yourself and how you relate to others. Sometimes your life changes for the better and you feel the same *inside*, but others will treat you different for the changes they see on the *outside*.\n\n\nYou will only know if being brave to ask. And if brushed off, you can see if they make attempts to stop being rude. If they don't change, you do NOT owe them a lifetime of being a punching bag friend just because they helped you in a rough spot. Friends who did that for me, I give them one or two chances. I'm human. I love them. I hope I'm wrong. Yet look after yourself too, and let them go if they are no longer being a friend.\n\n\nI hope they correct themselves and that this is just a snag.

The higher the price the less chance of a flake. Anything that would be less than $20 gets sold in lots or at a garage sale/flea market.

{"text": "I have a question. A couple years ago a friend of mine stated that they needed space from me. I asked them if they wanted to talk about anything and they said no. I continued using our group chat to communicate with everyone in the group but that clearly pissed them off. They had no problem responding to other people in the group chat but got snotty with me if I did it. So I asked them again (privately, and this was months later) if they wanted to talk. They said no. So I asked the group chat to remove me from the chat. I felt uncomfortable. Like I wasn\u2019t allowed to participate anymore. \n\nA few months after that our mutual friend invited us out to go dancing. I didn\u2019t know they were going to be there but they were incredibly rude and stand off ish the whole time to me. It hurt. A lot. The next I texted them again ti ask if they wanted to talk. They said, \u201cI am trying to create this boundary with you\u201d and ever since then I\u2019ve been confused. I mean, I told them that I\u2019m not going to be able to consider them a friend anymore if they can\u2019t talk to me, and that was it. \n\nThis person was actively getting a phd in social work. Do they know what they\u2019re talking about? Are they doing it wrong? What the fuck happened? Are they going to hurt people in their capacity as a social worker? \n\nWe were friends for over 7 years.", "label": 0}
{"text": "So, by nature a boundary is about consequences. I can have the boundary of \"I don't like it when people call me names\" This is my hulahoop.\n\nA new friend believes calling names is an endearment, but I don't like it.\n\nI can't stop this person from calling me or other people names, that's true. But what I CAN do is say, \"Hey, Ive asked you not to call me names, it makes me very uncomfortable. If you can't find a different way to show me you like me we'll have to stop hanging out.\"\n\n\"Well, I think calling people names is just fine as long as I'm not doing it to be mean, and I'm not being mean to you am I?\"\nBut they are, because you've asked them to stop and they didn't. They believe they have a boundary in a relationship but really they're trying to bully their way past yours.\n\nNow I have a choice to make. I can choose to not hang out anymore or I can let that person continue to cross the boundary. I cannot control another person; my friend will continue to call me names no matter how much I protest and I know because I tried asking them to stop.\n\n(Once you start yelling, bullying, threatening, or intimidating that's when all bets are off and it's another situation entirely.)\n\nYour \"hula hoop\" is a space that takes practice to make for yourself. It's hard to put down boundaries just like it's hard to hoop, but once you practice enough it'll be much easier.\n\nHope this helps! \ud83e\udd20", "label": 0}

You inform your partner your boundary is \"I won't be with someone who has sex with other men\". They can choose how they act.

{"text": "Syrups are also incredibly easy to make at home as well. 2:1 syrups (sugar in grams:water in milliliters) are the way to go and only require you warm sugar in water and add any flavors (toasted nuts, extracts, herbs, fruit, etc) toward the end when the sugar is basically fully incorporated, let cool, strain very well, and bottle.
