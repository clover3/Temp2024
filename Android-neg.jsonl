End of 2022 is when the 3G CDMA networks on T-Mobile & Verizon were sunset.\n\nApple did use Intel modems on Verizon models in the iPhone 7 and 8 series, and they performed much worse than the Qualcomm equivalents. By the iPhone X, Apple was putting Intel modems in the AT&T and T-Mobile equivalents (all GSM), and Qualcomm modems in the Sprint & Verizon Variants (CDMA for 3G, LTE onward is all GSM) because their performance on CDMA was so bad.\n\niPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 series have all used Qualcomm modems because Intel/Apple have never shipped 5G capable modems and they need 5G support to be competitive in the modern smartphone market.", "label": 0}

The A18 pro is the best SoC in any phone, but android people tend to not buy iPhone and vice versa. S24 would be the closest competitor to a Pixel 9.

{"text": "Yeah it has had a negative impact, in terms of routing a lot of traffic through roads that you would never use if navigating using a paper map. In the city where I live (London, UK) traffic has doubled on unclassified roads (i.e. ones deemed not important enough to be part of the numbering system) since GPS apps became popular. But over the same period, traffic on other categories of road has barely changed at all.\n\nI suppose that's not necessarily on Google though. To them, roads are just data representing lines on a map, and they don't really differentiate one line from another. If local authorities don't think a road is suitable to take large volumes of through traffic, then there are ways to prevent that, e.g. traffic circulation plans (although these are rarely seen outside of urban areas).\n\nSome kind of \"keep to main roads\" option would be nice, but really unless the places you're driving through have done the legwork to try and keep through traffic to suitable roads, the only option as I see it is basically to keep an eye on your phone, and keep manually correcting the route when you see it's taking you on a detour to \"save time\".", "label": 0}

I have heard that Samsung isn't the greatest at photo processing though.\n\n\nI've never replaced the charging port or battery but at the moment a charge takes 5 to 6 hours, if the cable is bent the right way, and three times slower than that charging in a car. I could theoretically fix this DIY for less than $100 according to Google.\n\n\n\nI also used to play mobile games in the past but I haven't for a while now; I'm not sure if that's because I've changed or my phone has no storage space for huge modern mobile games which run up to 10-20+ gb each.

Plus while x86 > ARM translation is already possible on Linux even for games including some intensive ones, today there isn't really a distro that makes this a straightforward process. Rumors that Valve is working on SteamOS for ARM, but it's not there yet.\n\nGaming angle aside, Qualcomm's prompt upstream Linux support for these chips makes me think they want to leave the door open for laptops that use those chips instead of their more powerful but more power hungry X Elite cousins.", "label": 0}

I can literally go click a button in my apple account and migrate all my photos, show me that in Google.+\n\nThere is virtually nowhere that Google Photos has any better feature or functionality beyond limitations.\n\nThe photo picker itself as shown here, is so limited in functionality that it segregates cloud photos from local photos, prevents multi-select/searching/sorting in cloud photos, and makes the workflow 5 steps longer. Want to post 10 cloud-photos from a month ago? Use the google photos app and share them to messages. The simple functionality of using a photo picker to search/find/preview/multi-select is broken irreparably. You can't convince anyone this hot garbage is good.\n\nOn the apple side your comment makes no sense, telling an app it can only access X photos is fully reversible and changeable at your discretion and protects your privacy. There is no logical way it locks you in.\n\nYou are correct, though, using a Google phone is super painful after using Apple because the ecosystem is built in such a consistent, user friendly, and functional manner that it locks you in. That's why they don't care about letting you have easy ways to migrate out - because they know you likely won't want to. Everyone talks about 'customizing' google and every 1.5 years I test out an Android for a few months -- right now I'm on a Google Pixel XL Pro and the lack of consistency in functionality due to this photo picker is phenomenal. At least this time I'm not dealing with the massively fragmented Samsung ecosystem and the rest of the phone seems to be running well, except GBoard auto-correct that sometimes decides it doesn't want to work at will, and the massively fragmented health ecosystem. Health Connect, Health Sync, Fit, Fitbit. But don't worry because while Google Fit is basically the foundation of all health data and by default installed --- it's deprecated -- functionality TBD.

I also like the way my company does it. We break a single feature into multiple user stories. Each user story at max would take 2 weeks (but ideally 1) development time and then would be merged. Eventually the entire feature will be in there for us to do end to end testing, but each individual story was also well tested. I can't believe Google was merging entire features at once to master.

{"text": "I totally get the struggle with intrusive notifications. I had a similar issue with my OnePlus and ended up using an app that mimics the Dynamic Island feature. It provides a much cleaner look without the annoyance of always-expanding notifications. The way you've described Dynamic Spot sounds pretty slick with those animations and customization options. I find having those tiny, quick-access notifications makes using my phone way more enjoyable, especially when I'm in the middle of something and just want a quick glance at who messaged. I can see why this would make you appreciate your notifications more!", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'll give a few examples from my tablet.\n\nMy tablet came with like 4 different notes apps on with no explanation of the difference. The S-Pen button behaves completely differently in all of them, even though they all really do the same thing. Trying to remember it all is annoying and you end up with muscle memory. One takes voice notes but I'm not clear if it's they show up with my other voice notes that I take in different apps.\n\nEasier to just not use it and take text notes in keep.\n\nThere are at least three different ways to screenshot, all with different names and behaviour.\n\nMy Samsung Watch has Sleep mode, Theatre Mode, Silent Mode, and DnD mode. All incredibly similar and not really well explained. Some sync to the phone, and others don't. It's easier just to not use them and manually turn the screen off at night.\n\nI can set some Dex settings in Settings > advanced > Dex. But then some settings are only available when in Dex mode in a completely different menu (settings > Dex). And some settings are only available in one of the two Dex modes and you have to remember which. And then even more are hidden away in Good Lock. You have to check 4 places when you want to change something.\n\nThe whole thing is overcomplicated. I'd rather have fewer options that are better thought out, than overwhelming with poorly explained, poorly implemented options, where you're left thinking \"I am sure I saw an option to let me do this manually somewhere\".\n\nWhereas with the Pixel, 9/10 times it just  does what you want out of the box and often it's automated. It is annoying when Google gets it wrong and it's Something you can't change, in which case the Samsung might handle it better. But the vast majority of times the experience is just better on the Pixel.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Great experience.\n\n\nAll of my phones are from less represented brands. My last phones have been AGM, Ulefone, Sony, and Nextbit, and the current ones is Solana (OSOM/Essential).\n\n\nAs far as advice, I would say that there are some general rules like you generally get what you pay for. I would also recommend sticking to ROMs that are more stock when it comes to buying phones from smaller brands. Aside from that, do your research. Confirm which bands the phone uses. Confirm that carrier coverage works with actual user reports. Look up the update history. manually look into the chipset that they use. Etc. It's very hard to find unbiased user reviews and organic discussions about the hardware, but that's what you need to look for. I generally skip all mainstream Android coverage because, as you saw in your first response in this thread, the general consumer, even on purported \"tech fan\" style boards, is closed-minded and biased.\n\n\nThe Saga that I'm using now is probably the highest quality Android phone that I've used. It legitimately feels iPhone quality with the ceramic materials. Battery life is six or seven hours, which isn't amazing, but it's very predictable (it's due to the chipset), and the OS is actually quite well optimized. I got it for dirt cheap brand new. Yet i'm sure that the MBKHD (sic) video about how it's the worst phone ever will be spammed out in response.\n\n\nSo, one thing you might run into is that carriers will hate you and refuse to work with you. I actually had to spend two hours at a store getting this phone activated, even though it has full 5G band support. The closed-mindedness and idiocy does not stop at the walls of the internet, so keep that in mind.\n\n\nThat said, the vast majority of people probably will want to just stick with something normal, But I've liked buying different tech for decades \u2014 since before smartphones existed \u2014 and I don't plan on stopping. It's fun to be a hobbyist. It was fun to have a skin temperature sensor on my Ulefone and it was fun to have a night vision camera and thermal cam on my AGM. But do your research. In particular, there are many trash OSs out there with things like bad process management.", "label": 0}

No universal back gesture still, I hate that sometimes the back action is a tiny unreachable label in the hardest to reach part of the screen. Multi-select is always a huge chore, and most iOS apps make mass deleting elements almost impossible. Near complete lack of any kind of control over the layout of the home screen - I don't even care about widgets, I just don't want the screen to completely change every time I try to move anything.

And for the longest time, had a generational advantage in brightness, black level accuracy, and power efficiency compared to other Samsung OLED devices. \n\nAll of this to say, many of Apple's products look deceptively simple, but are technical marvels of manufacturing.", "label": 0}

Having more ram in most cases only help you fit more apps into ram and switch them faster. But TV's don't have such requirements for multitasking as phones. Lots of system services that run on phones might not be needed on TVs. I think it should be achievable to make things run on 1GB on ram. Google are the ones making the updates so I guess they know what they are doing.\n* It's minimum requirements. It doesn't mean that no device can't have more ram.\n* Your anecdotes about having low ram and Android tv being laggy are probably invalid. Low ram can make switching apps and loading things slower, but actual video decoding and overall performance doesn't depend that much on amount of ram.\n* Saying how everyone should just pay for more expensive thing is so American. Not everyone has $1000 tv and there are places in the world where android tv box cost is not just a rounding error.", "label": 0}
