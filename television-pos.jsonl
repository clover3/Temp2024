Schools only cater to the lowest ability and never the highest, doing those students a huge disservice if their parents can't afford to seek a better school.

{"text": "Are you aware by now that you blatantly lie here and stated it as facts? Shame on you.\nI reviewed documents of all institutions involved \nI break it down for you what happened:\n\nThe accusers aunt took her to concerts and meet & greets since she was 12. So she was some kind of a \u201esuperfan\u201c from Canada and was known by the fandom, employees. He responded to text messages for 2 month of a finsta account with pics drinking and smoking in the profile and he assumed the account belongs to someone who was of age. Most likely they were fake too. That was some month before the concert in a 18+ venue in december 2017 when she was 15. \nAt some point it got flirty but he became suspicious and asked her. She revealed her age, he said \u201ehurry up\u201c (that was stupid) and he then blocked her immediately.\n\nShe went to 9 additional concerts and paid for meet & greets but he wasn\u2018t aware it was the same person. When he announced he has a fianc\u00e9e she reported him 1 year later in 2018. \n\nIt follows an extensive investigation and everything she claimed beyond the texts were proven false. Even her witnesses testified against her and digital forensics found no nudes she claimed he send her.\n\nSo he got charged with \n\n1) misdemeanor disseminating matter harmful to juveniles (2907.31 section A(1)) bc texting is still illegal in Ohio even he was unaware of the age and \n\n2) 4th degree felony attempted child endangerment (2919.22 section A) bc she was in a 18+ venue and she may have been harmed (e.g. drinking alcohol). Because of that he \u201e\u2026violated his duty of care\u201c even though there were 2 person of her family present all the time.\n\nNo other charges were pressed, he plead guilty to both of them bc it happened and during COVID he had no money to fight the charges. With the knowledge we have today, we can assume he didn\u2018t want it to be revealed that he was a CSA survivor himself. They would\u2019ve brought it up in court. He wasn\u2019t ready for that.\n\nBut that\u2018s what it was.\nBtw The investigation found on her phone pics of his wife she took secretly. She was basically stalking her and him. But that\u2018s another story.\n\nThere is no predatory behavior in his actions at all. He wasn\u2018t actively looking out for minors on the internet and clearly had no intent to text a minor in the first place. He was basically catfished.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStatement of the court:\n\u201cThe victim\u2019s allegations that went beyond that which all parties agreed, not only lack supporting evidence but are contradicted by the facts learned through extensive investigation. As the court made clear, this plea was never about sexual misconduct or sexual relations with any person, let alone a minor.\u201d", "label": 1}

I specifically remember that a child character was killed in an episode which should be \"X-7: A Mysterious Enemy Agent\".\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n\"Although the series was violent by 1960s American standards for children's programming, in Japan it was no more violent than other tokusatsu TV series that were airing at the time. Gunfights are a staple of each episode and the show's two child leads (Johnny Sokko and Mari Hanson) were frequently seen shooting with the other Unicorn agents. In one episode, Johnny and Mari are captured and tied to trees by Gargoyle and are within seconds of being executed by a firing squad when they are rescued by Unicorn agents.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant\\_Robo\\_(TV\\_series)#Violence\\_concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Robo_(TV_series)#Violence_concerns)", "label": 1}
