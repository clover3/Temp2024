{"text": "First of all she was also a hooker in college don't forget that. And yes she's the worst choice for starting a mosh pit.\n\nAnd also for president. \n\nHighly decorated my ass. Successful hahaha hardly. \n\nMy non-support of Kamala has nothing to do with her just being a democrat.  92% of her staff quit when she took office as VP.   As a prosecutor, she was soft on crime and supported defund the police.  Biden appointed her to not only get to the root cause of border issues, but to secure the border as well - Which she has never done.  Biden/Harris have allowed hundreds of thousands of illegals, terrorists, child molesters and murderers into our country and people have lost their lives because of it.  She supported the violent riots all over the country and they have allowed the desecration of government property and the burning of our American Flag with no consequences to those responsible. Our country has never been in such turmoil more than under this administration. Even further, she started a go fund me for a cop killer, but let criminals walk while withholding evidence that exonerated an innocent man until AFTER higher courts forced her to accept it. \n\nTHOSE are a few of the reasons I do not stand by her OR accept her. I\u2019m all for a female president. I would love to see that in my lifetime, but just not her.\n\nAnd also don't think she's a good choice to start a mosh pit.", "label": 1}
