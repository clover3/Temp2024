My first bf I was 14yo and I was really into him but any time we tried to do more than just cuddle I got so up in my head about it, anxious, awkward/uncomfortable, and just felt bad. My next bf and I were much closer friends, we talked about everything and were friends before we dated. I was a little older, 17yo but we just got a lot more comfortable with being close so when things progressed (eventually lost my virginity to him) even though it was definitely a little awkward it didnt bother me at all.

Instead of hitting her with this 'PLAN' you made up so you can eat nuts 6times a year and not kill her, i would have been asking her questions and building options or a plan together.\n\nLike asking her about the allergy, severity, is it from injesting or just being near nuts? Does she go to the hospital just from contact or carry an epi pen? Does she ever risk eating out in a place that has nuts in the kitchen or does she only eat from home? Explain you wanted to understand if theres a way to eat nuts or meals made near nuts once in a while without hurting her and ask her if and how that would be possible. If its not then okay. If it is ask HER, the person with the life threatening allergy, how to do that correctly AND how comfortable/uncomfortable that would be for her. The way you phrased it makes it sounds like eating pesto is more important to you than her life, which i dont think is what you actually meant.\n\nI would apologize for coming across poorly and ask to talk about it with her. Emphasize her safety is your number 1 concern and if that means never eating this stuff again so be it. You were just trying to discuss if there was a safe way for you to still eat something just once in a while and if she would help explain to you if yes or if no because you never want to make her uncomfortable.

{"text": "Why do you feel like you get \"good\" advice\", you're just getting another persons opinion that may be biased because of their relationship with you. It sounds like at times you are simply substituting another persons assessment of a situation for your own. \n\n When you disclose every personal and intimate detail about your relationship with another person you are in a way violating their privacy. It also sounds like you have some emotional issues that you need to work through and the best way to deal with those issues is with a trained therapist.\n\nTo be clear, I am not a therapist, just another asshole expressing my opinion, but as the saying goes \"opinions are like assholes, everybody has one\".\n\nTalk to a therapist about \"emotional maturity\". For me it means that many emotions are a response to a situation (conflict, fear, anger, etc) that makes you want to respond in some way based on that emotion. Often it is better to ignore the emotion, or at least to not react until the feelings and or urge to think or say something has passed. The urge to respond immediately is sometimes merely a learned response or habit formed in childhood.\n\nEspecially when it pertains to a relationship with a partner / spouse it is best to give the emotions time to subside and then communicate about the issue. Constantly spilling your guts to other people all the time is more likely to complicate a situation than improve it.\n\nA concept that is helpful to me is that of the fact that other people don't MAKE you have a feeling or emotion. When someone says or does something elicits a feeling or emotion in you, it is a product of your mind and not something that was injected into you. Our emotions, to a degree are a product of our subconscious processing information based on past experiences and at times it may not be helpful to react based on our initial emotional response.  Sometimes it may be necessary to respond immediately but generally that is not the case with most interpersonal issues or conflicts.\n\nOnce again, NOT a therapist but life experience and help from therapy.", "label": 0}

If he's in love with this girl but likes the ego boost of you flirting with him, that's not a good friend. You can be honest with him if you want, but I think for your own sake you need to take time away. And I mean NO CONTACT. I know it will hurt but it hurts anyway. I'm old enough and have seen it happen enough times that if you stay in his life the way things are now, 1 of 2 things will happen: 1. You will pine for him. You will emotionally connect with him and you'll stay close to him which closes out the possibility for someone else to come in who's awesome. Or 2. You blow up his relationship. There's no other option. Either you get together or you don't, and if you do, you risk his current relationship. Now if he wasn't happy and didn't love his current girlfriend I'd say shoot your shot, but because he does there's not much for it. Because by flirting with him and him continuing to stay with her you both run the risk of emotional cheating which can tip over into physical. \n\nSo yeah...

You might have some hangups you need to talk through to feel comfortable and settle into your rhythm and find your sex life. You might have some questions about different types of sex. You don't want to start finding guys who like you for your lack of experience - you want someone to want mutual connection, like you. Absolutely nothing wrong with that girl. In case you have some snakes in the grass in your head holding you back then go see someone, even just for a recalibration. It might help and you could try dating apps at the same time and explore your emotions as they arise. Maybe there's things around dating that scare you. A therapist can help with that when your friends may not understand.\n\nRemember, this is all at your own pace. Perfectly fine to go on dates and don't kiss or have sex for as long as you like. I usually wait 4 months, which seems weird to others but I want to know the person before anything happens. And I'm always happy to call it quits and be friends if the connection isn't there.

{"text": ">I\u2019m nearly at the 3 year mark of this relationship after moving my whole life around for him and he\u2019s deciding to just take his sweet time to ask me to marry him\u2026I have a problem with that.\n\nIt's pretty clear you both have different perspectives on this. I don't think it's at all abnormal to take this long, and it sounds like your SO doesn't either, but if you're *expecting* marriage after 3 years then that *alone* might make you both incompatible with each other (Nb. you're probably not going to be married after 3 years with this guy - so think about that, and if it doesn't sit right with you, you should just end it now). Frankly, I think it will make you incompatible with a lot of people, and when you do get married it might mean you're rushing into something that you'll later regret (and I disagree in the strongest possible terms that waiting longer is \"wasting time\")... but that's a totally different conversation, and obviously it's your call at the end of the day regardless.\n\n>Plus I really thought this person was my one and only, truly. It just doesn\u2019t seem like my affections or anything I\u2019ve done for him so far is noticed or appreciated. \n\nCan you elaborate on this? I meant to ask you earlier to do that, sorry if that didn't come across clearly. It sounds like there's more going on here than just \"he's waiting to ask me to marry him\".\n\n>Don\u2019t get me wrong, he does his part and I\u2019m very grateful, I just personally don\u2019t enjoy the fact that it seems like he\u2019s just kind of taking advantage of having a woman in his house to help him with things and have someone available for him all the time, and also his plain disregard for my desire to marry, even though he can see how it would make me very happy.\n\nI think I need to know more details here. Other than \"he hasn't asked me to marry him yet\", how is he taking advantage of having a woman in his house, and how is he disregarding your desire to be married? If he's not ready, he's not ready - but that *on its own* doesn't mean he's either taking advantage of you or doesn't care about your feelings.\n\n>And lastly, just the fact that he swears he wants to marry, yet hasn\u2019t taken a singly step towards that goal.\n\nI asked about this in my previous reply (but I realized after the fact I had a typo, so it may not have been clear what I was asking), but what would a \"step towards\" marriage hypothetically look like, other than a proposal?", "label": 0}

I'm not saying this is the case, but it could be a possibility. Also, it must suck for him to know that you will never be 100% able to trust him.\n\nI understand him having second thoughts about getting married given your history.

{"text": "\"But I was stressing about it continuing to be pushed off because it takes time to plan a wedding and there would be certain things I need to take care of with my parents who only travel when there\u2019s no snow.\"\n\nSo I wanted a long engagement for planning purposes (several years). That was always my partner's and my agreement. Then some life circumstances happened and we realized we'd save a boatload in taxes and be able to secure much better health insurance for him at the same time if we got married before the end of a particular year. So I knew he was going to propose and we'd have a short turn around time to plan.\n\nIn my situation I started dress shopping, picked the date, secured the venue, and secured the photographer before he officially proposed. It wasn't a big deal to me, because I knew 100% he was going to do it. \n\nI share that because I'm curious, are you doubting that he'll propose by the end of November? Are you resentful of how long he's left you waiting? In other words, what is it you actually want to get across to him by telling him how you feel?\n\nIf you're resentful such that it's impacting the relationship then, by all means, you should talk about it and about your relationship overall. If he has a pattern of procrastinating on things, trying to make things so special that he becomes frozen in doing so, or of not meeting your needs than that's a bigger relationship issue to discuss. \n\nWhen talking to him try to remember you said Summer or Fall of 2024 at this point (so he's right on track) and that it's entirely possible he doesn't realize how hard it will be to plan a Summer or Fall 2025 wedding (because to him that's a year away and he likely isn't as aware of how hard it is to plan a wedding these days/ how far in advance you need notice). \n\nIf you're doubting that he'll propose then talking to him isn't going to force the issue. At this point, you'll know in about a month anyway. \n\nIf you are, on the other hand, certain that he'll propose, what's actually stopping you from doing the things you need to do to plan in advance? You can start touring venues without a ring, you can start talking to loved ones about dates, etc.", "label": 0}

So I told him this and he acknowledged that he understands why I\u2019m getting tired of waiting and that it will happen this month or November\").  But the reality is, he's already told you he's open to planning in advance so there is a solution to that stress (\"at one point he did say we could start doing that before the proposal\"). \n\nYou're saying that you don't understand why he doesn't just take action knowing how much it upsets you (\"I don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t just take action when he knows how important it is to me\"), but you also detailed that he is clearly trying to plan something perfect and getting stressed out (\"he told me he had thought about doing it that day but said \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to wrap my mind around it because I wanted to think of a speech.\u201d ....He told me later he had planned to propose that weekend but had forgot to pack the ring. He seemed genuinely mad at himself because it would have been the perfect opportunity.\"). So you actually do know why he's struggling to execute this aspect of getting married.  You say \"I do believe that he wants to propose and he wants to make it special\" but then you also say, \"Maybe I have a little doubt too.\"\n\nAll of that is okay! It's absolutely okay to be conflicted and frustrated at this point since you've been eagerly anticipating a proposal for 1 year and 6 months and know he has had the ring for at least 6 of those months. But, I think if you approach him without actually knowing what it is you want at this point, it's going to end up being a frustrating conversation for both of you.\n\nHe's clearly nervous and wants it to be perfect. He's clearly planning on it happening in the next month or so. A serious talk about how disappointed you are that it hasn't happened is just going to up his anxiety. If it doesn't happen in the next month, I think you need to recognize there are bigger problems in the relationship that he isn't communicating. On the flip side, as I said before, it does make sense to talk to your partner about how the delay has made you feel and, if it is part of a larger pattern, address that before you get married. But I also don't think that conversation needs to happen right away and I do think it'll go better once you're actually able to articulate what it is that is bothering you.\n\nBecause it's clearly not about planning alone, if it were that you would have taken him up on his offer and started planning. I suspect it's more about how the waiting has made you feel like he's not recognizing your needs and the tiny part of you that is worried he may be having doubts.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Here is my relationship of 11 years for comparison. \n\nHe meets me at the station everyday after work. I always look forward to seeing him and his face lights up when he sees me. \n\nWe constantly joke around together. We laugh a lot. We tease each other and have fun. \n\nWe enjoy doing things together but also apart. I can't wait to tell him about my day.\n\nI find him very sexy and we love a cuddle. We are getting older now and our sex life has had to change because of it but the way I'd describe our physical relationship is - playful.\n\nSometimes when I look at him I feel this overwhelming feeling of love. I know he has this too because I can see it in his eyes.\n\nOccasionally, when he's tired or having a bad day, or just in a bad mood he'll get frustrated or angry or grumpy. When that happens I'll kind of tell him off, or take over and deal with whatever it is that's frustrating him. He does the exact same thing for me when I start to lose it. That way, as a couple, we are always reasonable, calm and grounded.\n\nSometimes he talks too much or takes too long to get to the point. It can get on my nerves on occasion but I'd never tell him so because it's who he is and he can't really change that and I'd never want to hurt his feelings because I love him. You gotta let the little things go because nobody's perfect.\n\nWe are very much encouraging of one another. For example I can now drive because he bagged me to start the driving lesson that I'd said I'd wanted to take but had always put off due to fear. I passed my test aged 57. \n\nBy year three in our relationship I knew deep in my heart that this is the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.\n\nIf you don't feel the same way about your relationship then  my advice is to cut and run and find a girl that you do feel that way about. I couldn't be with someone who just agrees with everything I say. That would be a definite no no. \n\nIf you do stay then you need to work together in being closer. Definitely do not get married until you have the feeling that you absolutely want this person forever and ever.", "label": 0}

Have your cake and eat it too. But that's not reality. In terms of sex she will have way more options than you that she doesn't pay for and will get affection from. By having sex with hookers you risk contracting sexually transmitted diseases. By even bringing this up you are risking your dynamic that from what you say you really enjoy aside from sex, and you risk your entire marriage as well.\n\nMaybe try more open communication with your wife and having BOTH of you listen to each other and discuss what is going on, maybe try some couples therapy.", "label": 0}

The alternative, that you are experiencing involves pining for them, stroking their ego while being made to watch them enjoy other romantic partners, hoping to god that someday they will see you in a whole new light and fall head over heels for you.   Sometimes that does happen, BUT usually not, and usually within the friendship timeframe (more like reconnection way down the road).   \n\nTake this lesson with you through life because along with it comes withstanding the annoyances from mutual friends that get weaponized when you need space.   Btw, that\u2019s very a very manipulative thing to do, and it\u2019s hard to believe any of these people are actually mutual friends when none of them understood where you were coming from and instead formed a gang up session to brow beat you into seeing yourself as an over-reactor that should just roll with the flow even though it hurts you.   Next time you say \u201cLook, I appreciate your opinion but my decision is final on this, and I need to do what\u2019s best for me.  If you are truly a friend of mine who cares about me, you will step off this and respect my decision as final and will not continue to try to argue it with me; so drop it and be my friend, or continue to keep it up and show me that you aren\u2019t my friend.\u201d   If they can\u2019t drop it, then they are showing that they are team her not you.   Space yourself from any of them who doesn\u2019t apologize and drop it too.  This is what cleaning house looks like.  These awful times sometimes reveal who needs to be purged.\n\nAs for politely ending the friendship.   You know that ghosting won\u2019t work, and you a lot know that she is not above weaponizing friends to harass you on her behalf.   You say she already knows something is wrong so she isn\u2019t going to drop it.  The only way here is rip the band aid.   Write her something like this\u2026.\n\n*\u201dWhen I asked for space, because I needed to work on getting over you, that was for my well being.  Then you solicited friends to delicate the task of convincing me that I was being unreasonable and over reacting.  Against my better judgement, I heeded their advice and gave our friendship another chance.   But this has since changed since happy hour the other night when I couldn\u2019t help but overhear you boasting to someone about how my purpose in your life is nothing more than an ego boost and having me at your beckon call while simultaneously puffing yourself up as being so much better than me and how I am too ugly for you to ever date.   This revealed to me what kind of a friend and what kind of person you are.  If you put any of your friends up to bothering me about ending the pretentious friendship you had with me, that shows who they are as well.  My decision is final and I leave you with this parting message\u2026beauty is skin deep and fades, but ugliness within is forever\u2026.good by, good luck in life.\u201d*", "label": 0}

Instead they have been impulse decisions that results in 2 botched up tattoos and a new botched up tattoo.  If she had communicated it...  I would have pointed out that the artist she picked doesn't have the experience that's needed for the design", "label": 0}

{"text": "My honest opinion is that this man has issues committing, and it's not just down to wedding jitters. \n\nOn and off relationships rarely transform into happy, settled marriages. You also seem to have somehow switched from on/off to living together and getting married at breakneck speed. That's another bad sign - and usually not something the committmentphobe can sustain long term.\n\nMy point being: His commitment issues won't magically disappear because you sign a marriage contract. They will continue to manifest. Whatever you do, make sure you go into this with eyes wide open, and acknowledge the man for what he is.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Why don\u2019t you pretend as like you\u2019re talking and meeting up with someone else and get his reaction? Obviously if he\u2019s happy then it\u2019s a kink thing but if he gets mad he has his own issues and is either a serial cheater, or wants to have control of you by him cheating and not letting you cheat back, maybe that\u2019s another kink he has- putting down women and controlling them otherwise he would just say yes to the options you\u2019ve said? Anyway I hope you\u2019re okay, the behaviour just seems strange because if he\u2019s telling you one thing but his actions are different how can you trust him when he says he loves you and wants to marry you? Serial cheating often goes hand in hand with persistent lying so be careful.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Certain anxiety and depression meds can indeed cause loss of libido.   Unfortunately, this means nothing is turning him on, not even any kinks that normally would when not on the medication which makes your questions about what he\u2019s into, fruitless.    My question is, did the relationship start while he was already on the medication?  If so, it\u2019s also possible that he\u2019s an asexual and maybe doesn\u2019t realize it, especially if this is a track record regardless of medication.  \n\nNow if this has been a long term partnership and this started up or has been ongoing, I might have suggested a sex therapist or other ways to compromise where you are both satisfied.    But this is only three months in, and in this short of time, this is already a huge incompatibility issue.
