{"text": "Sure, can you explain the difference between how scientists define gene therapy and how the SEC doesn't actually use any sort of strict scientific definition? \n\nThe reason I ask is because my understanding is very different and would mean that the SEC's definition is rather irrelevant in the context of this conversation.  \n\nThe document you shared is a filing from Moderna, a company that makes one of the COVID-19 vaccines. In it, Moderna mentions that mRNA vaccines, like theirs, are sometimes put in the same category as \u201cgene therapy products\u201d by the FDA. This doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine changes your DNA, though. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\t1.\tWhat mRNA Vaccines Do: mRNA vaccines, like the ones from Moderna and Pfizer, use a small bit of genetic material called mRNA to teach your cells how to make a piece of the COVID-19 virus (the spike protein). This helps your immune system learn to recognize and fight the virus if you\u2019re exposed to it later. The mRNA breaks down quickly after it\u2019s used, and it doesn\u2019t interact with or change your DNA.\n\t2.\tWhy They\u2019re Called \u201cGene Therapy Products\u201d: The FDA (the government agency that approves medicines) sometimes groups mRNA vaccines with \u201cgene therapy products\u201d because they are new types of treatments involving genetic material. However, this is just for regulatory purposes\u2014it doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine is like traditional gene therapy, which is meant to change DNA to treat genetic diseases.\n\t3.\tOther Types of COVID-19 Vaccines: The Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine works a little differently. It uses a virus to deliver DNA instructions for the spike protein, but this DNA also doesn\u2019t change your own DNA. This method has been used in vaccines for other diseases, so it\u2019s a more traditional approach than mRNA vaccines.\n\nIn short, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines don\u2019t change your DNA or permanently alter anything in your body. They\u2019re just grouped with \u201cgene therapy products\u201d by the FDA for oversight reasons, not because they actually change genes.", "label": 1}
{"text": "So your the expert?\n\n\nTell me, how exactly does your immune system learn?\n\n\nIt's by memory cells, the b cells and the t cells right?\n\n\nAnd how do the b cells do this learning?\nIt's by somatic hyper mutations which involve changes to the DNA right?\u00a0\n\n\n>In short, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines don\u2019t change your DNA or permanently alter anything in your body.\n\n\nDisinformation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I hear this \"late night dump of ballots\" a lot from Republicans.  But please let's remember a few things.\n\nLast election Trump and Republicans spent MONTHS saying \"don't vote by mail!\"  So of course this lead to a huge disparity of voting by mail being favored by Democrats rather than Republicans.  While the inverse, voting in person, was favored by Republicans.\n\nIn some states, like PA, they can't even begin to open the envelopes of the mail in votes until after polling has closed. If you have a ton of votes that you need to open and count and you can't even begin until 8pm then of course it's going to take well into the night to finish counting.\n\nNext thing to consider is that where there are more votes it's going to take a much longer time to count.  That should be pretty obvious.  Counting 10,000 votes takes longer than counting 200 votes.

{"text": "So John Kelly's eyewitness testimony is that, it's hearsay. We have no proof trump said those things and it cannot be proven. Such statements would never hold up in a court of law and cannot be trusted as fact.\n\nThe vanity fair article with Ivana is the same as the above. No does reading historical books signify that he agrees or aspires to be like the historical figure. I would argue that if he did this it's probably partly where he learned how to make good speeches. It means absolutely nothing in terms of him trying to a dictator though. I can read the 52 rules of power, but that doesn't make me some evil manipulator. You aquire knowledge and then can use it to benifit you sure. Where the knowledge comes from is of little importance as long as you motives are pure. \n\nHim calling Putin smart is quite literally just a true statement. Putin has to be smart for him to still be alive and in full control of Russia. It doesn't mean he agrees with the guy.\n\nAs for his use of speech such as poisoning blood of the nation, vermin, ect... It is bad rhetoric, but does not signify at all that he wants to exterminate or commit genocide. That is an absurd comparison. If Trump came out and said we need to start offing immigrants for no reason other than their skin color, id be right there with you fighting against him. But that is not at all what he is saying.\n\nEverything that you have just typed into this message is : \n\n1. Appeal to Emotion (Pathos)\n\nThe language used, such as \"Nazi Rhetoric,\" \"dictators,\" \"fascist,\" and comparisons to historical atrocities, seems aimed at evoking a strong emotional response rather than solely focusing on logical evidence. This tactic can lead to biased interpretation, appealing more to feelings of fear or disgust than rational analysis.\n\n\n2. Association Fallacy (Guilt by Association)\n\nThe argument suggests that Trump\u2019s praise for foreign leaders or his possession of a book of Hitler\u2019s speeches implies alignment with, or support for, dictatorial or authoritarian values. While these facts may be relevant, assuming his actions or similar intentions without further evidence can lead to a misleading conclusion.\n\n\n3. Cherry-Picking\n\nThe argument selectively cites incidents that support the claim of Trump\u2019s alleged admiration for dictators and fascism while ignoring any statements or actions by Trump that might contradict this narrative. This selective presentation of evidence can create a distorted view.\n\n\n4. Straw Man Fallacy\n\nThe argument may misrepresent Trump\u2019s actual statements or views to make them easier to criticize. For example, describing his praise of leaders as an endorsement of their authoritarian qualities might be an oversimplification of his comments, which could have been made for other reasons (such as recognizing strategic intelligence or strength, not necessarily endorsing their ideologies).\n\n\n5. False Analogy\n\nDrawing direct comparisons between Trump\u2019s language and historical authoritarian rhetoric (such as Hitler\u2019s or that of the Nazis) implies that similar language has similar intent. However, language can have varied meanings based on context, and drawing a direct parallel can be an overreach if the full context of his statements is not equivalent to those historical examples. \n\n\n6. Appeal to Authority\n\nThe argument relies heavily on John Kelly\u2019s opinion as a former chief of staff, suggesting that his personal views about Trump\u2019s fitness, character, or intentions hold authoritative weight on Trump\u2019s character. Although Kelly\u2019s perspective is significant, it doesn\u2019t necessarily serve as conclusive evidence, as it remains a subjective viewpoint. In this case it is also Hearsay.\n\n\n7. Slippery Slope\n\nThe argument appears to imply that Trump\u2019s language and admiration for strongman figures suggest that he would, if given the chance, govern in a fascist or dictatorial way. This presumes a chain of events or motivations without clear evidence connecting them directly.\n\n\n8. Confirmation Bias\n\nThere\u2019s an apparent focus on information and sources that reinforce a particular viewpoint about Trump\u2019s alleged admiration for authoritarianism and fascism. This narrow focus indicates a biased approach to interpreting and selecting evidence", "label": 1}

The financial impact of protectionism; the effect on women's health and rights; the looming threat over the heads of LGBTQ people; the cosying up to the enemies of democracy so long as they show the correct amount of deference to Trump himself (NK, Russia); the climate change denial, which flies in the face of one of, or the, biggest threats to the West, or even the world today (and which is set to make any current migrant crisis look tiny).\n\nIt's fine to say \"let's tackle illegal immigration\", but by definition it was already *illegal*. Previously the guy said he would build a wall and Mexico would pay for it. Didn't happen. So even if he had a \"positive\" plan for blaming poverty and inequality on immigration and then addressing it, why should we even believe him? Considering what went on last time - i.e. separating children from families, putting them in cages - I'm not absolutely sure that I want him to do what he says he's going to do, but even if he says it, I don't necessarily believe it would happen. It would be very naive to believe him.\n\nPlus, I mean, you're missing the point about the cats and dogs thing. It's a factor of the election being absolutely riddled with complete misinformation. People are willing to believe a complete lie, doubled down on by the VP - or the have the cognitive dissonance of knowing it's a lie but pretending it's correct in a vague, \"it's not true but it's believable\" way. What does that say about the American public's grasp of the issue(s), the media's ability to hold liars to account, or the clarity of the talking points? What else are they lying about?

Is Trump a narcissist, an egoist, who feels as if he is entitled to power, and is desperately vengeful and spiteful about anyone or anything that criticises him? Yes.\n\nWould such a person use the means at their disposal - the far right, evangelical Christianity people, useful idiots who just go along for the ride and the opportunity to feel like they're important and having an impact - would he use those means to grip on to power, even if it meant throwing the people that these groups hate - LGBTQ people, women who don't want to just be a womb on legs, religious and racial minorities - under the bus?\n\nThat's the question at hand, and that's where \"never again\" comes into play. Don't you think that it would be reckless and irresponsible to see someone hinting that they may do away with elections, signalling that they don't believe in climate change, that immigrants and liberals are \"the enemy within\" and are secretly Marxists, that most immigrants are criminals and rapists who barely have an understanding of modern societal norms, such that they'll eat your pets and so on - don't you think it would be irresponsible to see this happening and shrug?

He's far from being morally or intellectually above using his more extreme supporters to ride the wave to endless emergency power. That's what people are worried about, so far as \"he's a Nazi, he's a fascist, and so on\".\n\nQuite part from that, he's an abhorrent person who has done some utterly disgusting things during his last presidency, so even taking out this casting of him as a right wing demagogue aside, most people are upset to see the return of that \"kind of thing\".

Trump, even though he did a bad job of it, has proven he can at least get through a term.\n\nAdd that to the fact that a percentage who may have voted for Clinton decided \"I don't mind a woman, leading, that's not so bad, but a black woman?

For gay people, gay marriage, the right to live without persecution, the right to openly discuss homosexuality without it being seen as a perversion.\n\nHomosexual activity was legalised in 1962 in the US. Sex discrimination laws were extended to trans people in the workplace in the US in 2020. The ban on transgender people in the military was lifted in 2021.\n\nThere's a whole wikipedia article on trans rights in the US and attempts to limit these rights and roll them back. If the theoretical \"public toilet\" issue was enforced, then effectively trans people would disappear from public life, or else we'd have some kind of bizarre system where toilets are policed (which, again, would effectively disappear them from public life).\n\nI'm not getting into arguing about whether these laws or rights or whatever are correct or incorrect, by the way, that's a whole other rabbit hole, I'm just pointing out the things that conservatives would want to roll back (or in some places have rolled back.\n\n>What rights don't women or POC have?\n\nThe former - the right to universal healthcare and contraception in certain states, the latter... well, Jim Crow was a thing until just recently. I've also seen/heard conservatives talking about how they want to roll back the inclusion of PoC in schools etc. i.e. the right to free association, \"if we want to have all white schools then this should be allowed\", that type of thing.\n\n>I'm all for equality of opportunity, but equality of outcome/equity/etc is just reverse discrimination.

A middle class person has access to education that a poor person doesn't, extra curricular, a support network, money to go on trips and other resources, money to go to college... etc.\n\nIt's not just about material, monetary wealth in terms of being \"set up\" for the future. It's about opportunity, education, networking, and so on.\n\nAlso, I would add, 27% is not at all impressive! Less than one third? That sounds bad. Especially in, you know, Horatio Alger myth \"American Dream\" country. I could just as easily say \"did you know that only 27% of the super rich are self-made\".

Plus I would argue that if you put someone in such a situation, don't expect them to say \"you know what, I will climb out of this hole\". They make predictable choices. It's unreasonable, unrealistic, and frankly weirdly cruel to say to such a person \"just try harder, be a software engineer, that's what I did!\"\n\nI mean there's also a further argument to be made here which is that - no one, and I mean no one, ever, ever, becomes \"super rich\" off their own back. They become super rich by exploiting the resources they have at their disposal (letting their money earn money) or by exploiting the labour of others (hiring people).\n\nAlso this is certainly the case with the likes of Trump or Musk, who *were* silver spoon children and *also* definitely exploited people or took the ideas of others, or let their money do the \"work\".\n\nThere's the further, further argument that your approach *doesn't even make any practical sense*. Your approach is \"you fucked up the first 10 years of your adult life well tough shit bub!\". How is this in any way conducive to a functioning society? A socialist wants what's best for the most number of people, and a capitalist can see that putting people on the scrap heap of life for the remaining... 60-70 years of their existence, turning them into a drain on society, potentially even a criminal, is a very bad idea for both business and \"the markets\" and the stability of society. Why the hell would you want to put someone on the welfare state or in low paid, low productivity jobs for the rest of their life as \"punishment\" for messing up the first 10-20?

Today the same position is routinely called radical left-wing.\n\n\nThat tells you how much the political spectrum as a whole has shifted to the right, apparently without even being noticed by most of the right wing.\n\n\nWhen you write \"generic Republican\" in 2024, are you not aware that this is hugely different from Romney in 2012, or a generic Republican in 2012?\u00a0\n\n\n* Why did Trump need a massive, all-encompassing purge of \"RINOs\" over several years if your assumption is correct and today's GOP is still similar to 2012's GOP?\n\n\n\n* Romney, by the way, is firmly against Trump and has warned of a Trump presidency often https://www.foxnews.com/politics/romney-stays-course-whether-supports-trump-president-matter-personal-character . That alone should tell you that the two are not similar at all.\n\n\n\n* But even apart from that: How does that comparison even apply? Romney e. g. was criticized heavily for saying about poor people: \"And so my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" Can you imagine being criticized for that in today's political climate? If Trump had said that, the only thing that would have happened is silence and Trump getting a few more votes.\n\n\n\n* Later, under pressure, Romney retracted the statement and said that was \"just completely wrong\". Can you imagine retracting that statement today? (What has Trump ever retracted?)\n\n\nSo: in what way do you feel there's a valid comparison here? I feel you've basically said \"don't worry about the house fire, because in 2012 you spilled a cup of boiling water, and that was mostly harmless\".", "label": 1}
