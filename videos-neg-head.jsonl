Thankfully, the majority of the town voted to pass a $55 million bond to build a new school to get rid of these units. That said, in poorer districts, they are likely to vote down these bonds as they can't afford the tax increases.", "label": 0}

From an IT perspective, when doing the Middle School Tech lab, they didn't bother to include IT whatsoever in the design/planning phases.  Not until after it was nearly finished did we come in to set up and see - no internet.  The stools they had bought for the computer desks didn't fit at the lab tables, so kids knees were higher than the tables.  Re-did the transportation building, actually looked pretty good, built a meeting room that also had a kitchen in it.  Fancy projectors and TV's for display....put in areas that you couldn't see from the meeting tables, which were arranged in a horseshoe pattern as the only way, so half of the meeting couldn't see the screen behind them.  Installed a glass like whiteboard for writing on, against our suggestion, only to find out when projected upon, it made it a blurry double image, so the projector couldn't be used until another pull down screen was installed over it...instead of just using traditional whiteboard like everywhere else.  The list goes on and on.\n\nThe waste because they had to be the smartest people in the room and then blame it on the support staff for not \"making it work\" just pissed me off to no end, and they would show the good parts and it was such a \"huge success!\"", "label": 0}

Anyone who wants more money for schools should expect a direct percentage increase in property taxes.\n\n> While I agree, funding should be done at the state level and distributed based on need, there's not a chance that will happen.\n\nThere are a lot more underperforming schools that can't pass bond measures than there are schools in good shape.

{"text": "Okay so I have sooo many to reply to this, english isn't my first language so sorry in advance haha \n\nYou start with currency. From my understand the biggest benift of using crypto as a currency and why it got made to be used as a currency was for a few reasons. No government controlls it, they can't just print trillions out of thin devalauing that currency (it's why Bitcoin got made in 08 after the government printed trillions to bail out the banks). The other reason it got made a currency is so it could be sent without tarrifs and fees for sending it overseas. I have family all over the world and for some of them it takes Soo long and is a massive headache to send them money through my bank to their bank. Crypto as a currency fixes this problem does it not? \n\nCrypto does not make you anonymous and anyone who thinks that has no idea what there talking about. There's a record of every single crypto transaction. You can look up every btc transaction ever, who sent what, who recieved what, who's holding what etc. Once you put a name to a wallet(which isn't hard to figure out) then everything is transparent. It's why I think governments will put their currency's on a blockchain so they can track, trace and tax everything \n\nI like that blochains create a layer of trust and authorisation that doesn't need a central government, institution or cooperation(for most of the blochains, some are still centralized like Solana) \n\nNFTs are a super underated technology that will get utilized as medical records, real-estate deeds, birth cirtificates, passports, ID's etc \n\n99% of crypto wont be around from now but the actual technology won't go anywhere and is the reason the industry is worth over 2 trillion", "label": 0}

All my careers have been \"on the go\", some more than others. \n\nHandful of issues in Seattle or Portland. San Diego, I had five+ meals stolen over a three month period, one of which I have a vivid memory of looking out and seeing a guy just sprinting with a Buca Di Beppo (Italian place) bag across the parking lot of the hotel I was at. Dude ran like forest gump. Uber was super easy to deal with at the time and they kept comping me. I was worried they'd flag my account at one point but I assume they knew their drivers were not the most reliable. \n\nWhere I'm at now, I've only lost one meal in 3 years and the driver didn't even attempt to hide it. They drove in a circle at the restaurant and then marked as delivered. Its funny because that one was the most annoying to deal with when it came to complaining to grub hub. They fought me tooth and nail, eventually had to do a charge-back. It encouraged me to stop using the services entirely. \n\nNow I have the time to meal prep and part of my new years resolution was to cut down on eating out since I have the free time, so I don't get to play those games anymore.", "label": 0}

{"text": "> No government controlls it, they can't just print trillions out of thin devalauing that currency (it's why Bitcoin got made in 08 after the government printed trillions to bail out the banks).\n\nOkay, so this would be the 'Decentralization' idea. And, as with anonymity, I think there are two answers: First, crypto often doesn't even try to do this, and when it does, I'm not sure it succeeds. And second, I'm not sure if we actually want this.\n\n---\n\nFor the first part: There are plenty of crypto systems deliberately built to be controlled -- admittedly these are usually built on something like NFTs or smart contracts more generally, rather than the pure-currency of something like BTC. But even with something like BTC, there are several ways that decentralization falls apart in practice:\n\nFirst, the underlying software of the chain itself is still made by a relatively small team. *Someone* has push access to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. (At a minimum, Github itself does!) Forks are possible, as was demonstrated recently when ETH migrated off of PoW -- a number of people stayed behind on ETHW, but this made basically no difference. And that migration shows that whoever controls the software absolutely *could* decide to print trillions out of thin air.\n\nBeyond the software, the chain itself is set up so that no one person controls it, right? Except that time one BTC mining pool got so large that the pool owner accidentally controlled a majority of hashing power on the network. They voluntarily split up, or at least that's what we're told.\n\nThat doesn't look that much more decentralized than a democratically-elected government being able to set monetary policy.\n\n---\n\nFor the second part: BTC is a deflationary currency, by design. Economists generally agree that moderate inflation (on the order of 1-2%) is Good Actually. But not only is there a fixed amount of BTC ever, because some of it gets destroyed (people occasionally lose their wallets), the end state is actually a periodically-*decreasing* amount.\n\nThe econ-101 problem here is: It's a deflationary spiral. When this happens to currency, people are strongly discouraged from spending any money on anything, because anything you *could* buy will be cheaper (relative to your money) in the future. If nobody's buying anything, then companies end up laying people off, who will then have even less money to spend, and you end up with a depression.\n\nOf course, you could design a chain to have a set amount of inflation... but then you can't respond as the economy shifts. Should it be 1% inflation? 2%? If you guessed wrong, and if it really is decentralized, that means there's no one to change it if you get it wrong.\n\n---\n\nBut there's a more fundamental problem: It's not just monetary policy, it's also... *any* safety net around *anything* financial. If you buy things with a credit card, the credit card company is liable for fraud -- if anyone steals your card, you don't have to pay for anything they buy with it. Even with the money in your bank account, banks will often try to intercept fraud, or give you ways to stop or reverse fraudulent transactions when you find them. If you have your own crypto wallet, you have none of this protection. If I steal something from your wallet, it's mine now, the end.\n\nThis same principle applies to most of the other 'decentralized' applications you get into later. It turns out most people are better off having a central authority who can resolve issues like that. Of course you can do that with crypto -- maybe there's a crypto bank, and you keep most of your currency there -- but that defeats most of the purpose of crypto in the first place. I mean, now the bank *is* central control over crypto!\n\n---\n\n> The other reason it got made a currency is so it could be sent without tarrifs and fees for sending it overseas. I have family all over the world and for some of them it takes Soo long and is a massive headache to send them money through my bank to their bank. Crypto as a currency fixes this problem does it not?\n\nNot unless it's anonymous, which you just said is impossible.\n\nGovernments have *already* begun to regulate crypto. There is nothing stopping a government from imposing the same tariffs on that transaction. You are just hoping you won't get *caught.*\n\nFortunately, and possibly driven by competition with crypto, it seems to have gotten easier to transfer money electronically (using normal fiat currency) than it used to be. But you might know more than I do about how that actually plays out.\n\n---\n\n> It's why I think governments will put their currency's on a blockchain so they can track, trace and tax everything\n\nThis is the perfect example of a \"better done with a normal database\" problem. Blockchains are slow -- without some extra layer on top (that starts to look increasingly like a normal database), there is actually a hard limit on the throughput of the blockchain, because *every* transaction has to be federated to *every* node. And that's to say nothing of the extra energy waste, especially from PoW chains.\n\nFor comparison: EVE Online has its own currency. Plenty of games do, but EVE is famous for explicitly allowing real-money trading. In WoW, gold farming can get you banned; in EVE, it'd just be part of the game. [They aren't doing anything with blockchains](https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/blockchain-and-eve-online), at least not on the main game. And I guarantee they can track, trace, and tax everything in the game.\n\n---\n\n> NFTs are a super underated technology that will get utilized as medical records, real-estate deeds, birth cirtificates, passports, ID's etc\n\nThis is one of the dumber ideas crypto-bros have come up with. Let's break these down:\n\nMedical records are quite private. Blockchains are the exact opposite.\n\nNFTs for deeds don't solve any problem deeds have, and create new ones. Let's start with: Does possession of the NFT mean you own the thing it refers to? If I steal the NFT of your house, do I own your house?\n\nIn any reasonable society, the answer would be no. A deed can be used as *evidence* that you own something, but the government ultimately decides who owns what land, even if it has to go to court.\n\nIn other words: This is a centralized system, and as with currency, it's better for most people that it's centralized. And because it's centralized, the blockchain doesn't really add anything useful here. Why would an NFT be better than just a digitally-signed record from the local government? Or even just a paper deed that everyone physically signed? Just have the government keep all these records in a nice big transactional database, and give everyone enough evidence to be able to take it to court if that database ever has a mistake.\n\n---\n\n> the actual technology won't go anywhere and is the reason the industry is worth over 2 trillion\n\nIt's not clear it is, and that's not why it's worth that much.\n\nIt's not clear it is because of the sheer volume of fraud in that market. Wash trading is blatantly illegal, and absolutely rampant in crypto, and an easy way to make it *look* like there's absurdly more value than there actually is.\n\nAnd, the reason it's worth anything is speculation. It's not worth that much because everyone is hyped about the hot new *software patches* that are about to land. It's worth that much because of all the speculation, because everyone is hoping to be able to sell their crypto (currency or NFTs) for more than they bought them for. Same reason trading cards are worth as much as they are.", "label": 0}

What is a reasonable violent crime level given our resources and quality of life and how do we rank compared to the rest of the world? Third, what constitutes violent?\n\n1. Violent crime is actually up in the last 10 years according to the FBI stats\n\n2. We have a 6.3 homicide rate compared to Canada at 2.3 UK at 1.2\n\n3. Kidnapping and Simple Assault are both up dramatically in the last 10 years yet they are not part of the FBI's violent crime numbers despite them being violent by their nature.\n\n4. Crimes like Property destruction/vandalism, intimidation, purse snatching, pocket picking identity theft, computer hacking and fondling are all up dramatically in the last 10 years. These are not considered violent offenses but if someone steals your identity, your purse or empties your bank account as part of a hack, these are all violent acts in terms of their impact on the victim, albeit not physically violent. \n\nTLDR: The USA is a resource abundant country and our violent crime rates are absurdly high compared to what they should be and violent crime is actually up over the last 10 years and is dramatically up if you count kidnapping, simple assault and fondling.", "label": 0}

Each school has a decile rating with schools in poorer areas getting slightly more funding based on census data and numbers of students.   \nIts then mostly up to the school board of trustees (made of parents) how it wants to spend its money which would be similar to a district school board in the USA.   \nA typical mid decile level high school or middle school gets about $8,500 (USD$5k) per student per year \n\nIt would be interesting to know how much a school in kansas gets per student per year.", "label": 0}

So usually for me, it's already removed from my account before it even gets reviewed by a human.  \n\nFor the ones that do get reviewed. Doordashing absolutely drains my phones battery, so I assume they're recording all sorts of metrics that they can tell by GPS/accelerometer and other factors whether or not after taking a picture of the order if I walked back over to pick it up and take it. \n\nFor this reason I always take my pictures as far away as possible, so it's very obvious I did not return to snatch food. \n\nSo far every \"infraction\" has ended in my favor(as it should), or disappeared due to me knocking out orders quickly. I also align my dashcam in a way, or at the very least walk in view of it when returning to my car so I can prove I did not return with the food. \n\nBut you're right.

{"text": "\"they\" aren't. But romhackers are.\n\nThe way the nes worked, it could actually display any image at 60fps in 56 colors as long as the image data could be put on the PPU bus fast enough. So if you offload all the processing, to say, another computer, then a stock, unmodded, NES can \"run\" any software ever written, such as [doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzVN9kIUNxw).\n\nThis is why the graphics of NES games got better as time went on, despite the hardware being the same. The cartridges had more memory and some gained coprocessors to handle the increased workload. As long as the cartridges could dump data to the ppu fast enough, they could make anygame they wanted.\n\nOf course at the time, it was not feasible to put an entire SBC in cartridge format, so they used the one provided in the base NES. hence why they all looked the same, even though there was no real hard requirement that NES games look a specific way due to how the PPU was implemented.", "label": 0}
