{"text": "1. Philosophy\u2019s Role in the Development of Knowledge: I think you\u2019re overlooking how deeply philosophy has influenced almost every field we have today. What you call \"philosophy_1\" and \"philosophy_2\" are not just stagnant categories\u2014they represent a progression. Philosophy started by asking fundamental questions, and as we refined those questions and methods, entire disciplines, like physics, psychology, and law, branched off. But this doesn\u2019t mean philosophy itself became irrelevant; it evolved, and its foundational questions continue to shape and inform our understanding.\n\n\n\n\n2. Kant\u2019s Contribution to Universal Human Rights: Dismissing Kant\u2019s contributions to universal human rights as just \u201cbasic empathy\u201d or something the Bible already covers overlooks how Kant shaped political and ethical thought. Kant proposed rights not simply as religious principles but as rational imperatives based on human dignity and autonomy, which had a huge impact on later political philosophy. The universal human rights principles we see in modern institutions, like the UN, owe a significant debt to this kind of philosophical framing.\n\n\n\n\n3. Debate on Innate Knowledge: While I agree that questions of innate knowledge are now often studied scientifically, Kant\u2019s work was crucial in setting up these questions in the first place. He reopened debates about what humans might be born knowing or how we experience knowledge, a line of thought that paved the way for later work in psychology and neuroscience. Kant didn\u2019t have today\u2019s scientific tools, but his ideas helped shape the field, pushing others to look at cognition and development in new ways.\n\n\n\n\n4. Kant\u2019s Ethical Theories: You seem to dismiss Kant\u2019s ethics, like the categorical imperative, as pointless or impractical, but I think that misses the point. His ideas about duty and morality independent of consequences added a new dimension to ethics that Greek thought didn\u2019t fully address. Kant\u2019s deontology argued that moral value is intrinsic, not just a matter of pleasure or pain, and this had profound implications on how we approach moral reasoning, justice, and even legal structures today. His work was not intended as \u201creal-world\u201d guidelines like a rulebook but rather as a rigorous ethical framework to test and question our moral assumptions.", "label": 1}

Quantum mechanics has been showing that when not observed by personal, localized consciousness, reality isn't definite.\n\nThe abstract quoted above certainly deals with \"localized consciousness\" as the presumed observer, as observation is treated as a function of consciousness. If you want to say that observation doesn't require consciousness or that localized consciousness doesn't exist then that's...certainly something you can say, I guess.

{"text": "It's not comparative, it's absolute. There are plenty of stupid liberals who happen to come to similar political conclusions as more intelligent liberals, and the same thing applies to conservatives. So it's not, \"conservatives are dumber than *me*, so they don't agree.\" It's, \"on the whole, conservatives are dumber as a total group, which means that, to the extent that an intelligent liberal's political views are changed by an understanding of issue complexity, conservatives, as a *group*, are less likely to follow or accept that reasoning.\" It does not mean that, were they more capable of following the reasoning as a group, they would accept the liberal viewpoint. Extremely intelligent conservatives disprove that assertion outright. And many views informed by complexity can arrive at the same conclusion as views that the issues are simple. Stupid liberals are proof of that as well. \n\nIQ is a highly imperfect measure of intelligence, but it does still strongly correlate. And to my knowledge, we don't have a better measure, but I would be happy to learn something new there. I look at it similar to political polling- it is decently indicative of what it measures, but it can be and often is wrong, sometimes very wrong. But it's not nothing.", "label": 1}
