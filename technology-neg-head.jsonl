It might help advance some branches of math a tad, but thats an added bonus.\n\nSome people enjoy following sports, and get excited by who wins the championship. Why can't math be the same way? There's a certain puzzle solving aspect to designing algorithms that can efficiently search for large prime numbers. Some find it a fun challenge. Discovering a new largest prime is exciting to some in the similar way to a swimmer breaking the world record is to others. I enjoy both. \n\nInterestingly, there is another sports analogy here. Just as money can advantage those in the sports world (people with means can often afford better trainers, equipment, etc), money played a role in finding this prime. The person who found it spent fortune on computer time (several million dollars). Most amatures cannot afford to spend that amount on the search. Historically, one of the great things about the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, was that anyone could get involved and make a contribution. Anyone had a chance of finding the next prime. But now, that might have changed. To be clear, I find no fault with the person who found the prime.", "label": 0}

Here\u2019s a side-by-side comparison that gives perspective:\n\nCEO Pay: Up around 1,460% since 1978.\n\nS&P 500 (SPY): Up more than 4,000% since 1978.\n\nNASDAQ: Grown over 13,000% in the same time.\n\nGlobal Market Cap: From about $1 trillion in 1978 to over $100 trillion now.\n\nWhen you see these percentages next to each other, it\u2019s clear that while CEO pay has grown, it\u2019s actually more modest when compared to the massive expansion of the market and global economy.\n\nToday\u2019s CEOs aren\u2019t just managing local or regional companies anymore. They\u2019re leading massive global corporations with responsibilities that extend far beyond what was required in 1978. Their decisions affect thousands of employees, supply chains, and shareholder value worldwide. Take the Fortune 100 companies\u2014combined, they\u2019re worth over $25 trillion, and boards want top talent who can handle the scale and complexity of these roles.\n\nGolden parachutes? I totally get the frustration there; it\u2019s hard to justify for poor performance. But the high-performing CEOs are expected to bring billions in value, which has a huge ripple effect on employees, shareholders, and the broader economy.\n\nAthletes, for sure, bring major value, but they\u2019re not steering multi-trillion-dollar corporations or driving entire industries.

The issue at question was whether VGHF could provide *remote access* to games (without any kind of mechanism in place to ensure that each copy could only be accessed by one person at a time).\n\nThe article also says \"More importantly, this also ignores the fact that libraries\u00a0*already*\u00a0lend out digital versions of more traditional media like books and movies to everyday people for what can only be described as recreational purposes.\" which is *very* misleading. \n\nIt's true that libraries lend out digital versions of books and movies, *because libraries pay for licenses to do so.* We do not have the legal authority to buy a random book, digitize it, and then provide unfettered access to it. If 100 patrons can access Book X online, it's because the library *paid* for 100 digital licenses. It costs libraries a TON of money to provide access to those books and movies; we're not just winging it and giving out digital access willy nilly. \n\n(For the record: I'm not unsympathetic to their goal; I, like a lot of library workers, think that our current understanding of copyright law is ridiculous and overly restrictive.)", "label": 0}

{"text": "I realize that this is going to get downvoted because people on Reddit think that anyone making more than them at their dead-end dollar store job is a greedy money-hoarding pig, but on the off chance that someone is willing to listen to reason instead of getting swallowed up by the outrage echo chamber that Reddit is infamous for:\n\n1. They laid off 2,550 people, but also hired more. According to [this page](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/msft/employees/), they hired a net additional 7,000 employees since 2023.\n\n2. Layoffs can happen whether a business is doing good or not. Sometimes roles become redundant or replaced with software, departments close down, business priorities shift, someone is performing below expectations but hasn't committed any fire-able offenses, etc. They are not only tied to the company's profits like most people believe, and a company is not obligated to keep someone around just because they have the money to do so.\n\n3. Executives of public companies are mainly compensated with cash and stock incentives, and the targets are hashed out ahead of time. The board doesn't just randomly decide to \"reward\" the CEO with a bunch of money, it's agreed on long beforehand. Imagine if you signed a contract with your manager to give you a bonus for meeting a performance target by the end of the year, you met it, but then they said \"we're gonna withhold your bonus because we had to lay off some people\". That's not how it works.\n\n4. Stocks are paper money, have no real value until sold, and go up and down with the market like the tide. Everyone loves pointing out how so-and-so CEO \"made\" $xyz million like it's being deposited into his bank account, but nobody ever points out when they \"lose\" $xyz million when the market goes down.\n\n5. Microsoft has [$75.53 billion cash on hand](https://companiesmarketcap.com/microsoft/cash-on-hand). Satya's payout was $73.9m, and even assuming it was all cash, that's just 0.0978% of the cash that Microsoft has. He's not \"stealing\" anyone's salary.", "label": 0}
