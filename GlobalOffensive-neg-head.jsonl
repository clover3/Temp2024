{"text": "i think m0nesy and niko are just simply better players in playoffs when you compare them to zywoo and spinx. vitality wasn't having problems getting to events, they were having problems advancing in playoffs. im pretty sure i remember there was a time when only magisk and dupreeh were actually alive in the playoff games and that's saying a lot.\n\nlook, i'm not gonne argue with you that money wasn't a primary motivating factor for them to join the team. remember what zonic got as a gift for helping them overcome their problems and eventually get them a major? a salary cut. of course magisk wanted to follow him, especially coupled with the idea of playing with m0nesy, spinx and twistzz, and when you look in retrospective, at the time, they were simply... just better players in every aspect than the teammates in vitality, only argument u can have is for zywoo but zywoo often goes missing in playoffs and monesy doesn't, and i say that as a zywoo fan.", "label": 0}

Then if you stop for a little while like a year or two, you can become nervous again quite easily doing public speaking till you regain your confidence and composure, at least that was the case with me. I can only imagine he's a bit nervous on LAN, feels the pressure more than usual and over time that will go away again and this might be somewhat contributing to his inconsistency. I want at least like 6 months to make an evaluation on whether he's never going to drop an MVP level performance again.

Valve isn't starting from square one. They have CS:GO as a template to follow, we want CS:GO as it was perfectly, but better. That should be what CS2 was on release. If you produce anything less than your previous product that in my opinion is a failure. \n\nI mean imagine if you buy an iPhone 17 and it's worse than the iPhone 16 like say for example, the battery life all the sudden is 40% less than the iPhone 16's and also then calls keep dropping out and the phone randomly crashes apps and the photos look like complete garbage. People would be mocking Apple all day because your previous generation product shouldn't be better than the new one they built. But then imagine if Apple over a space of three years finally updates the iPhone 17 to fix these problems like Valve does. I mean you could've just bought an iPhone 16 that same year the iPhone 17 released, which is supposedly inferior maybe in terms of the chip's performance, but you wouldn't have the headache and problems of worse battery life, calls dropping etc because it worked far better for three years you avoided problems. Thats CS2 vs CS:GO. The transition shouldn't of happened until CS2 reached a better state than CS:GO. The incentive also would have been there for Valve to actually fix CS2 because CS:GO was still out there and you wanted people to move to CS2. Instead, they removed CS:GO from online play, they replaced it with CS2 and forced tournament organisers to use it over CS:GO when the game was absolutely not ready.\n\nCS:GO is the foundation and it should be the bare minimum you serve your customers, when people download CS2 their first expectation should be, it's CS:GO but better. Instead, the impression people got was Valve used CS:GO as a template, wrecked almost everything about it (whether it be movement, animations, netcode, shooting etc), improved the graphics (probably the only compliment I can give this game), removed some content like Danger Zone or certain maps like Train (so you're already giving less than CS:GO did), pushed it out as \"Counter-Strike 2\" and then had a big cry about how the community are bullies when people complained about it being worse or that the community was ill-informed or whatever other excuse the Valve apologists and Valve themselves put out. The overarching point is, when people think of CS2 they had the expectation it was improved and in reality... it was a regression in almost every way and Valve's attitude is still the same which is: release shit game, have a lack of real communication with the community, bug fix it for 7 years till it's good, drip feed content and just hope people keep playing it when it's trash. I dunno but to me it's such a trash model, but it works for them every time because they have Steam and some legendary status amongst gamers for Half-Life and Half-Life 2, but honestly, it's tiring to have to wait 50 bazillion years for them to fix even basic things. Something has to change at Valve, they have to either be more vocal and explain their reasoning for certain things. Or they simply just have to employ more people or work faster at deploying updates and fixes for stuff.\n\nBefore someone attacks me, I love CS, I like Valve for their games and I have respect for when they do a good job like HL1 or HL2 or TF2 or L4D. But you know what people should be complaining as \"bugs\" for CS2, a game released in 2025 which is Valve like third CS game is minor bugs, stuff like \"Oh I found a way to run out of bounds on a map\" (forgiveable) or \"my skins show up a little bit wonky\" (okay minor thing but they can easily fix it), you know minor things. Instead, we're complaining that we can't plant the bomb as a bug (crucial to winning rounds in a competitive eSport) or pull out guns properly (kind of a problem when the game is about shooting other people with low TTK), that we have major packet loss or desync constantly (terrible thing for a mostly online game), that we're losing frame rate every subsequent update (why is this shit still happening?), that the game has stuttering (again why is this still happening), that we shoot people on our screen and the hits don't register (what you see is what you get guys!), that we have character models doing weird animations (MJ bug and others that we've seen), [that we can duplicate grenades \\(dunno if this is client side only but still a stupid thing lol\\)](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1gc7wul/fake_flash_flash_bug/), that demos playback are all weird and don't preview correctly, that the movement is inconsistent with jump height etc etc. This is major stuff that should've been bug fixed before release tbh or shouldn't be a thing at all. This is not Valve's first rodeo, they're not a small company giving it their first try, they have a damn blueprint a template to follow and they know what should work by now.

{"text": "The overarching point is that throughout all of these years netcode remained an unsolved problem. People are looking at the old times with rose tinted glasses (including 1.6). Since then, a lot of things have changed - people did not have an easy way to record footage and upload it then spend time analyzing frame perfect timings, the internet was much less data dense without everyone and their mom streaming tiktok videos, youtube and iptv 24/7.\n\nNow sure, there can be improvements, subtick 1.0 resolves a major inconsistency that required players to shoot in front of where they see the model. This negatively impacts the experience of being shot at. With the congestion going on in the network, Valve developed their own network of nodes to improve player routing as well as hide server IPs to avoid ddos.\n\nThere is a clear improvement, but each new technology will need time to mature.\n\nUnless we are all playing locally from the same mainframe or we solve transmitting data faster than speed of light there are going to be inconsistencies.\n\nSubtick 1.0 shows innovation, we know there are improvements in the works to reduce the amount of data that is sent which will have a positive impact. Valve is banking that further improvements will give them the edge if they do not already.\n\nThinking Valve is not aware of issues is foolish, the number of people in the industry that can reliably work on improving this system is very low. Believing Valve is developing subtick only for CS is also an inexperienced take. The code that goes into the engine gets shared and benefits will be utilized in other titles (like Deadlock) as well. They are hoping to set a new bar. Whether they will make it with subtick 2.0 or improvements over the initial version remains to be seen.\n\nOne thing is certain, delay cannot be eliminated with the current technology. Until then, you will never see what the other players or the server sees and we will see threads like the 2008 thread pop up again and again.", "label": 0}
