Having critically looked at the world around me I can see the merit of the complaints. I will say that when white people (particularly uneducated and ignorant ones) are called out for this and have also gone through it, it can make them feel alienated and attacked which drives division. It\u2019s not the black community\u2019s responsibility to be patient or anything, I just wish there was a better way to come together and have discussions, which is one of the only reasons I participate in this predominantly black community.

For example, racist cop sees black guy doing 2 mph over the limit and decides to make that a ticket. Then, he just says \u201cI smell drugs\u201d and uses that to flip the car inside out and see if there is anything else to jam them up on. Then, racists can point back at stats and say \u201cmurr but black crime\u201d while not acknowledging or understanding that racist cops exercising their \u201cjudgement calls\u201d to the fullest extent have padded those stats and it becomes a \u201cone hand washes the other\u201d game. \n\nSo, in full. Humans are selfish and generally fucked up at a default level in many ways. They are inherently selfish. The selfishness and any race related through. It\u2019s self related. They take credit for anything that promotes self. It\u2019s not about race. \n\n\nThen, there is racism and hatred which majority opinions push in their favor. \n\n\nI\u2019m typing fast and hope I didn\u2019t mistype anything here, but my view is that the credit taking is a part of human selfishness and not race related.\n\nThen there is also racism, which fucks with isolating stats for discussion like this.", "label": 1}

You can scroll and see testimonials yourself. They range from harmless to life altering. \n\nMy point is that your concern should not be that humans are selfish at their core - we know this.

{"text": "The deck of that article literally states, *\"If Trump wins the popular vote and loses the election, it could fuel a new bipartisan movement for reform.\"* The NYT article linked by Politico, is also cheating slightly (by excluding third-party candidates) to make the numbers even. Using that same data, the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/upshot/poll-trump-harris-election.html) reported that Trump has a 1% lead. He's also had the lead in every poll they've [taken](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/upshot/poll-trump-harris-election.html). The only time Harris has shown a lead was in the early October poll. And the NYT/Sienna is just one poll. Other publications are showing a clear lead for Trump like the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-leads-harris-wsj-poll-779f8516?mod=e2twp) with a 3 point lead for Trump, or [CNBC](https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2024/10/24/CNBC_All-America_Economic_Survey_Q3.pdf) with a 2 point lead for Trump. \n\nWhether it happens or not, all major prediction models have a Trump popular vote win but an electoral college loss as a real possibility, which is a vastly different landscape than 2016 when he had no chance of winning the popular vote.\n\nIt's also important to note that pollsters have shown time and time again that they undercount Trump voters. As reported by the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/29/how-wrong-could-americas-pollsters-be), there were \"substantial polling misses [in] 2016 and 2020,\" and while there were significant efforts to remedy it, they at least failed to do so between the 2016 and 2020 elections and there's a good chance they could have erred for the third time in a row. \n\nI think the strongest evidence though is how Harris and Democrats have been forced to adopted so many of [Trump's policy positions](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/10/10/the-trumpification-of-american-policy). Without this rightward shift, Harris would be lagging extremely far behind Trump, both in the popular vote and the electoral college. At the policy level, Trump has already won. President or not, many of his positions now have bipartisan support and will be passed.\n\nSticking your head in the sand does not make the problem go away. Outside of leftist echo chambers, Trump and his policies are popular while Democrats are decidedly not. The only reason this race is as close as it is, is become Trump is his own worst enemy. Anyone with his positions and a modicum of self control would be stomping this election. The huge swing right and the even greater anti-left backlash we've seen globally is clear proof of this trend.", "label": 1}
