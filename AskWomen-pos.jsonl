{"text": "I have a boy and a girl.  I can tell you 100% children are born with their personalities and individual unique ways of perceiving the world.  \n\nAs a a parent you do your best to nurture those in born traits towards their positive spectrum.  For instance my daughter is very creative, emotionally intuitive and can read people well.  This gift often comes with anxiety.  We all know the negatives of anxiety and you can enable those negatives by allowing avoidance.  I'm teaching her to articulate her thoughts and feelings and to embrace her anxiety as a means of signaling the areas of life she needs to work on, in essence run towards the scary things, not away from them. Parents are meant to let their children struggle to grow, but with guidence.  Guided struggle.\n\nMy son is neurodivergent and this comes with all the problems associated with social miscues. It is not sunshine and daisies but we are constantly communicating and supporting him when he has been bullied.  We don't run from bullies. We work together to find strategies to deal with them.  This will be a lifelong issue for him, but despite this he is a happy go lucky kid.  He has his own circle of friends and he knows that we are always in his corner.\n\nAny parent with an ounce of emotional intelligence knows you raise the individual while instilling the right values and character.  Boy or girl.  It doesn't matter.  You honor the individual while simultaneously teaching them to function in a social world and respecting others.q", "label": 1}

{"text": "In my limited experience, I'd say many intelligent (cis hetero) men prefer intelligent women \u2014 as long as it doesn't feel like they're more intelligent than the man. They want someone quick and knowledgeable enough to keep up and appreciate their intelligence, but not necessarily someone who is going to challenge or stretch them (someone they would have to keep up with). It seems shaped by socialization and cultural expectations across the board; many very intelligent women seem to reinforce these roles and have learned to gently undermine/hide their intelligence with cuteness or other masking. There are of course a minority of intelligent men who genuinely don't mind as long as their prospective partner is \"intelligent enough\" to be a good match (and it sounds like you might be one of them), and I hear that the other side of things seems surprising to you (as it doesn't seem rational to actively avoid partners who might seem \"too intelligent\"), but this is my experience as a woman. It seems more instinctual than conscious. When intelligence is embroiled tightly into someone's identity, especially a lot of men's, and men are conditioned to be providers, many men who have identified intelligence as their means to provide seem threatened by and uncomfortable with seemingly more intelligent women (particularly if it's intelligence in an area that has been generally masculanized; a woman they can teach higher level math concepts to might be hot, but one who might teach them something similar is friend zoned). In fact, I feel like it is sometimes more of an issue precisely for more intelligent men who work in presumed intellectual fields or identify strongly with their own breadth of knowledge and analytical ability. Of course this is anecdotal (though I've seen studies that support it) and broadly generalized with plenty of exceptions, but it seems far, far too common to be a coincidence or attributable to anything else. You mention it could be a pattern of incorrectly assuming the issue is intelligence when it's something else, but I've never met a very intelligent heterosexual woman who hasn't had to either mask or have a much harder time with dating.", "label": 1}

I'd be subtle and nondescript about how I go about looking for proof, because again I'd hate to accuse somebody of something I have no evidence for, and especially if it's a close friend; but I and a lot of other guys will absolutely burn bridges over this type of stuff.

{"text": "Thats not necessarily wrong exactly but is biased framing of it. \n\nAnother way to phrase it would be to say that male friendships of this type are ones that you you can be sure of your continued friendship even without constant validation of that friendship and that the friendship is not contingent on what they can provide for you emotionally. \n\nIt just IS, and will continue to be even without constant reaffirmation unless something huge occurs. There is the general understanding that even if you havent spoken in a decade if you reach out and ask for help they will be there 100%, but also that they wont want to burden you with anything unless they absolutely decide they cant handle it. So much of a mans interaction with the world is transactional and based in what they can provide that its almost a subconscious reflex to try to keep that mentality out of personal relationships.\n\nI would read what you wrote as male friendships having a stronger bond. All about how you interpret it, it doesnt mean the friendship is surface level. \n\nBasically boils down to: i KNOW you are there for me, you KNOW i am there for you, as long as we are hanging out lets try to forget our problems and just exist.", "label": 1}

Most people have surface level relationships in their life, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s morally wrong or terrible to have. It\u2019s okay to have surface level relationships LMAO.\n\nIf you\u2019re hurt by wording or the way someone explained something based on your own connotations that you added, I\u2019m not sure if Reddit would be good to stay on.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is definitely true. It\u2019s sort of a bond and loyalty you develop from shared experiences. It\u2019s hard because you hold on to that person that you knew before they became morally bankrupt. It\u2019s often how some friendships just drift apart.", "label": 1}

I know partners' names, but if there was a problem with work/family life, he would tell me, either verbally or nonverbally. If there isn't, then great, let's enjoy each others company.\n\nAt least for me, what makes my friendships so special is being able to tell when something is wrong, or even what is wrong, without having to say anything. Then, knowing if it's something that needs to be talked about or if he just needs a distraction.\n\n\nA couple of months ago, my friends were sitting around a fire in various states of sobriety.

Mature people understand that the people who would meet back up would be different people than they are now and that they both have a life to live in the meantime, expecting that person to \"wait for them\" is not mature. If they wanted to try being friends and going from there, sure that's a possibility. To hope that despite the fact that a partner is suppose to be there for the ups and downs of life, and you're both agreeing to do the exact opposite that you can just pick up right where you left off is just a big dose of copium. \n\nThe saying \"if you don't want me at my worst, you don't deserve my best\" is usually a sign of a toxic person but a couples who response to hard times is to take a few years for a break? Yeah, I don't see that going anywhere serious.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Healing from sexual trauma and relearning to feel safe and positive about intimacy can be a complex and deeply personal journey, and it\u2019s entirely natural to struggle with this. Many people find that they need time, understanding, and a sense of control over their own pace to rebuild a healthy relationship with intimacy. Therapy, especially with professionals who specialize in trauma or sex therapy, can be a supportive space for working through these feelings. Some people also find that focusing on self-compassion, setting boundaries, and gradually reconnecting with their own body in non-sexual ways helps them feel more in control and at ease. Remember, there\u2019s no right timeline, and it\u2019s okay to take things slowly\u2014your comfort and healing are what matter most.", "label": 1}
