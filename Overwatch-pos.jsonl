Get more artists since that's the department that has suffered the most, there's been so much filler and recycled crap in the BP and shop, it's insane. Get enough artists to create original cosmetics and to make proper cinematics like we used to have. I get it, a cinematic is insanely expensive to produce, but you will see that investment come back because....\n\nYou NEED to bring back the lore. Plenty of non-gamers got into overwatch because of the immense lore and masterful worldbuilding. Nowadays there is a fraction of that. It all used to flow together, now it's more along the lines of \"heres Venture they do the diggy\", \"heres Juno she's actually from space\", the differences between the backstories of OW1 characters and OW2 characters are insane. I know that the lore hasn't stopped completely, we still get backstories and little lore bits. But it's nothing like what OW1 had, in OW1 everything fit together like an ever-expanding jigsaw puzzle. It seems they might be trying to get back into deeper lore stuff with Phreak, a character that seems to have very close ties to OW1 stuff, but I don't want to speak too soon. Do you remember the last time we had a hero that really mattered to the lore? Imo, it was Ramattra, almost 2 whole years ago.\n\nMore free cosmetics. I get it, the game copied fortnite's model now so skins have to be $20 and we need battle passes and constant crossover skins. But surely it wouldn't hurt to give more skins for free? It's NOT generous to give a single skin during a temporary event, hell, the skins they usually give out are genuine garbage! Tell me the last time you actually liked a skin they gave out for free during an event, it's not been in the last year that's for sure. And don't even get me started on the absolute dripfeed of legacy credits, we should be getting atleast 3 times as many of them, if not even more. Some of those cosmetics are 8 years old, it makes me really regret not grinding more OW1 for lootboxes. Hell, I think they should increase how many OW coins you get from the pass, you really should be getting atleast the cost of the pass back. I think charging for crossover skins is okay, OW1 had paid skins too like the OWL skins, Twitch sub skins, Blizzcon skins, Pink Mercy etc. But OW2 is out here taking OW1 lootbox skins, changing the colors slightly, and expecting us to shell out $20. Respect the customer Blizzard, or we will back out at any time. But I guess you'll just shove out more Kiriko slop, since that seems to sell well regardless...\n\nTL;DR Blizzard please dump money into the game and everything around it, I promise it will pay back even if it will take some time to regain the trust.
