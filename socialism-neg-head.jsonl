Also see the sexual assault allegations against PSL, yet if that standard is applied to the Democrats, well nobody would ever vote for them. This anti-left (non liberal left) rhetoric is used to split the left, and push votes back into the corporate duopoly.\n\nBut there is currently a bit of a coalition between Jill Stein, Claudia De La Cruz, and Cornel West. Theyve appeared together, including with a former BLA member, Dhoruba Bin Wahad, who was a part of the Black Panther Party's rainbow coalition from back in the day and still working to advance a good socialist, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist movement. Those three left candidates could be found together at a few times this year, including the DNC convention.\n\nWe have to understand electoralism is not a path out of capitalism though.

See what I mean? Where do you begin? You may as well get a history of philosophy degree before you begin reading.\n\nIf you really want to, Lectures on Logic by Hegel's son is probably the most accessible primary resource you can find. Although I think familiarizing yourself with the economic side of Marx's thought is probably more useful than the philosophical, and is def under-discussed by Marxists.

{"text": "\"Faced with such difficulties, one frequently encounters two very different kinds of advice, both of which I regard as useless. The first is the suggestion that Marx\u2019s presentation is \u201cdialectical.\u201d In order to really understand what Marx meant, we are told, one needs to address the dia- lectic of German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel (1770\u2013 1831). On numerous occasions, Marx indeed engaged critically with Hegel\u2019s philosophy, and it influenced him. However, this influence does not consist simply in Marx having \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201capplied\u201d a few elements of Hegel\u2019s philosophy, which we should thus try to extract from Hegel\u2019s work. In the Postface to the second edition of *Capital*\u2019s first volume, Marx writes that he \u201ccoquetted\u201d with the \u201cmode of expression peculiar to him \\[Hegel\\]\u201d in *Capital* (Marx 1976: 103). Marx did not *accept* Hegel\u2019s conclusions, but rather a certain awareness of the requirements of scien- tific presentation and the problems that accompany it. By \u201ccoquetting\u201d with Hegel\u2019s mode of expression, Marx evoked that philosopher and paid homage to him. Nevertheless, Marx nowhere gives even the slightest hint that, in order to understand his own work, it\u2019s necessary to first read Hegel. Turning to Hegel\u2019s works could lead to even greater problems of understanding than *Capital*, and Hegel\u2019s relation to Marx could become less clear. I do not recommend *preparing for* a first reading of *Capital* by reading Hegel. Only *after* reading *Capital* does it make any sense to turn to Hegel and discuss the question of what Marx learned from him.\n\nThe second kind of advice is that one needs to prepare for reading *Capital* by examining Marx\u2019s other writings. However, under- standing Marx\u2019s \u201cearly writings\u201d is also difficult\u2014for example, the \u201cParis Manuscripts\u201d of 1844, where he developed his theory of \u201calien- ation.\u201d Moreover, one soon runs into Hegel again and the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach (1804\u20131872), whose influence there is significant. Furthermore, it\u2019s an open question whether Marx\u2019s theory of alienation plays a role in *Capital* at all, or whether he proceeds from completely different assumptions. Also, Marx\u2019s simpler \u201ceconomic\u201d texts, such as \u201cWage Labor and Capital\u201d or \u201cValue, Price, and Profit,\u201d are not the best preparation for *Capital*. The first piece of writing is based on talks com- posed long before *Capital*, and therefore does not represent the same level of knowledge. The second text derives from a talk Marx prepared when he had already begun working on *Capital*, but he did so reluctantly, since the context required making a number of problematic simplifica- tions. Instead of using these in some ways deficient expositions, it\u2019s better to begin directly with *Capital* without making any detours.\"\n\n\\- How To Read Marx's Capital, Michael Heinrich", "label": 0}

For an actual analysis of the USSR, I recommend *What Was The USSR* by Aufheben collective. \n\nFor understanding a bit more about Marx and his project more specifically, I really like the book *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital* by Michael Heinrich. The introduction and first chapter explain a lot about the socialist movement more broadly and its relationship to Marx. Here is a pdf/ebook:\n\nhttps://libcom.org/article/introduction-three-volumes-karl-marxs-capital-michael-heinrich\n\nIf you want something with a bit more to dig your teeth into intellectually speaking, i highly suggest Marx, Marginalism, and Modern Sociology by Simon Clarke. It compares Marx to modern sociological and economic theories and also traces Marx's development throughout his career.", "label": 0}

There are fundamental differences rooted in analysis and methodology that separate anarchists and communists; these are very different ideologies with arguably very different goals. \n\n\nWithout going into too much detail, Communism is rooted in a **material analysis** of reality, which examines history, economics, ecology, geography, sociology, etc. to arrive at a concrete (or as concrete as possible) understanding of the dynamic forces within human society. From this communists understand human society as a conflict between classes - the owning classes (bourgeoisie), who owns the means of production, and the exploited classes (proletariat & peasantry), who own nothing and must sell their labour to survive. A better, more equitable society can only be built once the totality of productive forces are seized by the working classes, who must build and defend a socialist state, which will progress through phases of socialist development before achieving \"communism\". \n\n\nAnarchism is an **idealist** ideology, rooted in the belief that the source of societal evils are \"authority\", \"coercion\",  \"authoritarianism\", \"hierarchy\", which are embodied by the \"State\". If only the state were to be abolished, people would naturally organize themselves into more free, more democratic, and more egalitarian social arrangements.

This is why I said it's a ''NO'' of the Greek people, and not Metaxas'.\n\nMetaxas only rejected the ultimatum because the Greek bourgeois interests aligned with the British bourgeois interests. However, in October 28, 1940, the day the ultimatum was sent, thousands of Greek people rallied to the streets against the invasion. Even if Metaxas had said yes to Italy, the Greek people wouldn't allow him to.\n\nThis isn't a post about Metaxas. Fuck him. It is about the heroic struggle of the Greek people in the entire decade of 1940, starting in October 28, 1940 with the imperialist invasion of fascist Italy and ending in 1949 with the civil war.", "label": 0}

I cheer for Ukraine simply because I've been there, met the people and believe that at least in Western Ukraine, they wanted to be part of the EU and the Maidan protests in 2013 were legit. Just as a lot of people in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea legitimately wanted to be part of Russia. This is my opinion, but part of the problem between these two groups is that they have created an environment similar to Canada in the late 1960s when French Canadian Nationalists were blowing up buildings. They felt like strangers in their own country leaving Quebec. Nobody spoke French, nothing was written in French and they felt alienated and persecuted. What ended that was Canada adopted French as a second national language, put French and English on road signs and did things that made it easier for integration and travel. That ended the bombings there and most of the steam for Quebec being its own country. Right now if people from the East or Crimea go Western Ukraine, only Ukrainian and English are on their street signs as English is a requirement for EU entry and a goal of the West. I can tell you from experience, even where Russian and Ukrainian overlap and are said exactly the same, reading those same statements can look very different. A good portion is completely different from Russian, or is a Russian word, but with a completely different meaning in Ukrainian. I will always support the Ukrainian side a little more because of the Budapest Memorandum, but its the working class that are going to lose their lives in this war.

{"text": ">That said, I'm generally more favorable to Russia because it's emerged, **perhaps unintentionally**, as a major power in the new BRICS hopefully anti imperialist system.\n\nHaving recently learned about Putin's 2007 Munich speech (I tried to link the speech from a Russian government website, but Reddit seems to disallow Russian websites, so you'll need to look up the speech yourself. All the Western websites come with liberal commentary *about* the speech, rather than just a simple transcript.), I'm convinced that Russia's role in building this new emerging dual power is very intentional and has been a goal of Putin and many Russian politicians for over 15 years. From the speech:\n\n>And\u00a0there is still one more important theme that directly affects global security. Today many talk about the\u00a0struggle against poverty. What is actually happening in\u00a0this sphere? On\u00a0the\u00a0one hand, financial resources are allocated for\u00a0programmes to\u00a0help the\u00a0world\u2019s poorest countries\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0at\u00a0times substantial financial resources. But to\u00a0be honest\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0many here also know this\u00a0\u2013 linked with the\u00a0development of\u00a0that same donor country\u2019s companies. And\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0other hand, developed countries simultaneously keep their agricultural subsidies and\u00a0limit some countries\u2019 access to\u00a0high-tech products.\n\n>And\u00a0let\u2019s say things as\u00a0they are\u00a0\u2013 one hand distributes charitable help and\u00a0the\u00a0other hand not only preserves economic backwardness but also reaps the\u00a0profits thereof. The\u00a0increasing social tension in\u00a0depressed regions inevitably results in\u00a0the\u00a0growth of\u00a0radicalism, extremism, feeds terrorism and\u00a0local conflicts. And\u00a0if all this happens in, shall we say, a\u00a0region such as\u00a0the\u00a0Middle East where there is increasingly the\u00a0sense that the\u00a0world at\u00a0large is unfair, then there is the\u00a0risk of\u00a0global destabilisation.\n\n>It is obvious that the\u00a0world\u2019s leading countries should see this threat. **And\u00a0that they should therefore build a\u00a0more democratic, fairer system of\u00a0global economic relations, a\u00a0system that would give everyone the\u00a0chance and\u00a0the\u00a0possibility to\u00a0develop.**\n\nAnd correspondingly, there is the annual UN Resolution for \"Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order\", which is signed by the vast majority of the world's countries every year and is opposed by all the Western countries. This has been going on since the mid 2010s. The text of the resolution specifies recognition that democracy \"is not merely a political term, but has economic and social dimensions\", and the US government once stated explicitly in writing that one of their grounds for opposing the resolution was that the US does not agree with \"the right of nations to economic development\".", "label": 0}

{"text": "Ex anarchist here. Anarchists and Marxists, although both ostensibly anti-capitalist, have very different visions of communism they want to achieve. For anarchists, even ancoms, they imagine a supremely decentralized landscape, thousands of self-sufficient conclaves where production is controlled by the local populace for the local populace. While this may socialize the economy locally, it is effectively creating thousands of small owner businesses, that will still be competing with other communities for control of resources and market share in order to trade (Anarchists will argue \u201cgift\u201d) for other resources or more technologically advanced products (i.e. medicine or industrial technologies) produced in other communities. How do self-sufficient conclaves even create the supply chain to build technologically complex goods? What will the potato commune have to give the cancer medicine producing commune that every other commune isn\u2019t already providing? This decentralization will simply create the conditions for the market, private property, and the big bourgeoisie to return, if it can even produce enough for its own survival. Reverting to isolated peasant communes is regressive. Anarchists will say \u201cNo borders\u201d when in reality it is thousands of borders for thousands of individual communes. Imagine the nightmare of navigating a different economic and political system for every town you come to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMarxists see communism as something very different, largely due to using Dialectical Materialism, Historical Materialism, and a Critique of Political Economy. Marxists view communism as a rationally planned global economy where workers are interconnected in production and distribution. Production needs to be scaled up under increasingly large spheres of working class controlled political and economic coordination in order to ensure that everyone has access to not just food, clothing, education, and housing, but advanced medicines and technologies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCreating a unified global system of production and distribution is what will finally put an end to class struggle and want. Economic and political coordination cannot be scaled to global, industrial levels through consensus decision making alone, it has to be done democratically, which anarchists wholly reject. \u201cDemocracy is a lie, it is oppression and is in reality, oligarchy; that is, government by the few to the advantage of a privileged class. But we can still fight it in the name of freedom and equality, unlike those who have replaced it or want to replace it with something worse. We are not democrats for, among other reasons, democracy sooner or later leads to war and dictatorship. Just as we are not supporters of dictatorships, among other things, because dictatorship arouses a desire for democracy, provokes a return to democracy, and thus tends to perpetuate a vicious circle in which human society oscillates between open and brutal tyranny and a the and lying freedom. So, we declare war on dictatorship and war on democracy. But what do we put in their place?\u201d [Malatesta - Democracy and Anarchy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1924/03/democracy.htm) What does Malatesta suggest in replacement of this? He dawdles for a few paragraphs before coming back to the idealism so often found in anarchist writing, \u201cIf they are determined to defend their own autonomy, their own liberty, every individual or group must therefore understand the ties of solidarity that bind them to the rest of humanity, and possess a fairly developed sense of sympathy and love for their fellows, so as to know how voluntarily to make those sacrifices essential to life in a society that brings the greatest possible benefits on every given occasion.\u201d A fantasy world where everyone somehow develops an unheard of selflessness to achieve an abstract \u201cgreatest possible benefits\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Che, Hampton, Ho Chi Minh, all viewed petit-bourg utopian Anarchism as incompatible with Marxism.

I plan on voting de la Cruz, because frankly I prefer her policy positions better than Stein, especially pertaining to energy. However, I also recognize that third-party candidates are not viable under US \"democracy\". The only state where a third party has seen any measurable amount of success is Vermont.

No. It\u2019s because there is an asymmetrical power relation between two groups and the group without power is racialized as inferior by the one with power, and subsequently was brutally oppressed for centuries. Race and class are the same thing. Now tell me how Palestinians can be racist against their oppressors? Racism has a direction: down. Hamas doesn\u2019t recognize Israel\u2019s right to the land, which was handed to them by outsiders, and seized.

{"text": ">Putting aside the state of Israel and the Palestinian issue I mean.\n\nYou can't separate the that issue from Muslim opinion on Jews. If you mean before Israel, then yes there was discrimination. Yet it was worse in Europe. Strangely, that rarely gets talked about.\n\nOf course the Arabs attacked these settlers coming in and taking their land from the start. Often their land was sold by their landowner and then they were quickly expelled. And this myth that Jews were ever the underdog has to stop. They had the support of the British and their army by the 1930s was already superior in terms of organization, training and technology than any of the native refugees they forced off their land. Then they were favored by the rest of the colonial powers. There was never a balance of power between Europe and their colonies. \n\nIf you treat a person as an animal for long enough, they won't treat you any better. The level of rage instilled into that charter is the fault of the oppressor also. But we can't seriously expect most Palestinians to actually believe that. Most Palestinians just want equal say in their own land, to be treated as a human being. We always have to give the benefit of the doubt to the oppressed. It's strange how you justify the inhumane occupation, rape, child murder, humiliation by pointing a finger and saying they theoretically would do the same to us. No, they know what it is to suffer.

Thank you!\n\nI think your justification - as I understood it, allowing a socialist nation a supply of resources and potentially manufactured goods beyond the reach of the capitalist world - is interesting and worth exploring. Like with capitalist space enterprises, the capital outlay for such a project would be formidable, but a consortium of socialist nations could perhaps achieve it.\n\nTo me there are many potential socialist justifications for exploring and settling the solar system.\n\nOne comes down to, maybe ironically, a famous quote from American astronaut Gus Grissom: \"Our God-given curiosity will force us to go there ourselves because in the final analysis, only men can fully evaluate the Moon in terms understandable to other men.\" In other words, if we value scientific progress and the broadening of human knowledge - as I think all socialists must - we need to be there ourselves doing the work.\n\nAnother justification comes down to internationalism. Space (as yet) knows no national borders; projects in space necessarily require the resources and labors of many nations. A space project uniquely undermines nationalism. The Soviets used this principle to great effect with their Interkosmos program, enabling many eastern European, Arab, African, and Asian nations to send their first citizens into space.\n\nAnother, from more of a siege-socialism mentality, is that it would be nigh fatal to a future world revolution to allow capitalism to firmly establish itself off-Earth. You think world revolution is hard? Try doing it on two worlds!\n\nThere are surely other justifications. I think your article was a firm start to the conversation.", "label": 0}

As space based industries expand (especially manufacturing and mining) it will allow for [orbital solar farms](https://www.energy.gov/space-based-solar-power) to be constructed which can then beam down energy. Asteroids from asteroid mining would also make for decent space stations with exceptional  radiation shielding once hollowed out, as well as NEO's passing near earth and a target destination with timely intervals could act as ferries that have fantastic radiation shielding (with resources needed to fuel the trip at an impressive zero, as, the NEO is doing all the work in traveling\n\nThe earth also isn't going to last forever.

(keep in mind this provision was passed this year by republicans, who have been notorious for voter suppression in my state, so i can't help but consider it being a tactic to split the non-republican vote in a swing state so they win. like, i hate democrats but i trust republicans even less lol).

{"text": "I think it's worth reading, both [On Orwell](https://redsails.org/on-orwell/) and [A Critical Read of Animal Farm](https://redsails.org/jones-on-animal-farm/) on Red Sails. Gorge Orwell was a rabid anti-communist. He also had some rather, positive, views on Hitler: \n\n>Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of Mein Kampf, and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his speeches. I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power \u2014 till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter \u2014 I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his photographs \u2014 and I recommend especially the photograph at the beginning of Hurst and Blackett\u2019s edition, which shows Hitler in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, that he is fighting against destiny, that he can\u2019t win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one sees turn upon some such theme.\n\nNeedless to say, Orwell was a bastard, and his works were garbage. They both should be remembered as such.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is a common misconception that needs to be corrected. Anarchists and Marxists, although both ostensibly anti-capitalist, have very different visions of communism they want to achieve. For anarchists, even ancoms, they imagine a supremely decentralized landscape, thousands of self-sufficient conclaves where production is controlled by the local populace for the local populace. While this may socialize the economy locally, it is effectively creating thousands of small owner businesses, that will still be competing with other communities for control of resources and market share in order to trade (Anarchists will argue \u201cgift\u201d) for other resources or more technologically advanced products (i.e. medicine or industrial technologies) produced in other communities. How do self-sufficient conclaves even create the supply chain to build technologically complex goods? What will the potato commune have to give the cancer medicine producing commune that every other commune isn\u2019t already providing? This decentralization will simply create the conditions for the market, private property, and the big bourgeoisie to return, if it can even produce enough for its own survival. Reverting to isolated peasant communes is regressive. Anarchists will say \u201cNo borders\u201d when in reality it is thousands of borders for thousands of individual communes. Imagine the nightmare of navigating a different economic and political system for every town you come to.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMarxists see communism as something very different, largely due to using Dialectical Materialism, Historical Materialism, and a Critique of Political Economy. Marxists view communism as a rationally planned global economy where workers are interconnected in production and distribution. Production needs to be scaled up under increasingly large spheres of working class controlled political and economic coordination in order to ensure that everyone has access to not just food, clothing, education, and housing, but advanced medicines and technologies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCreating a unified global system of production and distribution is what will finally put an end to class struggle and want. Economic and political coordination cannot be scaled to global, industrial levels through consensus decision making alone, it has to be done democratically, which anarchists wholly reject. \u201cDemocracy is a lie, it is oppression and is in reality, oligarchy; that is, government by the few to the advantage of a privileged class. But we can still fight it in the name of freedom and equality, unlike those who have replaced it or want to replace it with something worse. We are not democrats for, among other reasons, democracy sooner or later leads to war and dictatorship. Just as we are not supporters of dictatorships, among other things, because dictatorship arouses a desire for democracy, provokes a return to democracy, and thus tends to perpetuate a vicious circle in which human society oscillates between open and brutal tyranny and a the and lying freedom. So, we declare war on dictatorship and war on democracy. But what do we put in their place?\u201d [Malatesta - Democracy and Anarchy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1924/03/democracy.htm) What does Malatesta suggest in replacement of this? He dawdles for a few paragraphs before coming back to the idealism so often found in anarchist writing, \u201cIf they are determined to defend their own autonomy, their own liberty, every individual or group must therefore understand the ties of solidarity that bind them to the rest of humanity, and possess a fairly developed sense of sympathy and love for their fellows, so as to know how voluntarily to make those sacrifices essential to life in a society that brings the greatest possible benefits on every given occasion.\u201d A fantasy world where everyone somehow develops an unheard of selflessness to achieve an abstract \u201cgreatest possible benefits\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Che, Hampton, Ho Chi Minh, all viewed petit-bourg utopian Anarchism as incompatible with Marxism.

From what I can tell one of the big problems is that we're very low on housing stock\n\nFYI in most areas, this is actually a capitalist talking point used to convince voters to relax regulations on developers. \n\nWe are not low on housing stock. \n\nThe drivers of high housing prices, which is happening nearly universally, in every city in the US and Canada, are:\n\n\\-private equity purchasing large amounts of housing to flip, or alternatively to rent via corporate management companies \n\n\\-the use of algorithmic price fixing software wherein competitors collude not only on pricing, but also on holding units off market to artificially create shortages and raise prices\n\n\\-AirBnB, which takes housing off market to use as short term hotels\n\n\\-the use of housing as investment vehicles for excess capital by non-residents who do not live full time in various second, third, or fourth homes\n\n\\-speculation (ie house flipping)\n\n\\-money laundering", "label": 0}

{"text": "TL;DR: If you buy stock in China you are not participating in socialism, and will probably lose money. \n\nIf you look at a chart of the CSI 500, you can see clearly that aside from a bubble that burst in 2015, the Chinese stock market has been fairly stagnant over the past 20 years. If you've invested in that time you've probably lost money. It's very difficult to make money investing in Chinese equities because the truth is that the stock market is not very important for the health of the overall economy. Chinese companies do not primarily get their capital by raising it from selling stock. They usually get by borrowing loans from state owned banks who decide where credit gets directed.\n\nChina has what is referred to as a \"birdcage economy\", developed by Chen Yun, in which smaller markets are allowed some market elements in a socialist economy. The most important strategic sectors(Heavy industry, telecommunication, transportation, electricity and gas, real estate, ect.) are state owned enterprises. Smaller markets deemed less important to the security of the state are allowed a measure of privatization. \n\nThis is a policy that was started in the 90s known as \"grasp the large let go of the small\". The idea behind this is that in order to try and develop the country and industrialize, certian markets would be like a bird in a cage, and the cage could expand and contract as the needs of the people of China dictate. (For example, these would be things like hotels, restaurants, certain manufacturing of light industry ect., things not considered of strategic importance to the state) This is how the CPC views the economy. They don't want excessive competition, they want \"managed competition\". In China, the economy is viewed as a tool to assist the government and the interests of the Chinese working class, unlike western economies where the government is viewed as a tool to assist the economy.", "label": 0}

So you're getting a massively inflated value for your product with no work, no value added.\n\n\nBut I have a sense it gets more complicated I just can't intuit it.", "label": 0}

I don't know enough about Sankara's politics, but the central point of this document is that a communist struggle for women's liberation is necessary\u2014 to target the material capitalist basis of women's oppression, versus bourgeois liberal feminism which seeks to keep capitalism intact at all costs.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Oh, I think I\u2019m starting to understand. What you are saying is that although humans are born with certain tendencies, those tendencies are products of the interactions between the environmental and the biological factors from the previous time, right?", "label": 0}

{"text": "This. Astra Taylor of the Debt Collective is a master of this art and regularly brings up that the reason there isn\u2019t Medicare for All, decommodified higher education, and other key transitional demands already enacted is because of institutional blockers, not lack of mass support.

{"text": "I think this border of overlap is currently expressed by system justification theory (Jost & Banaji, 1994) on the psychology side, explaining how people come to hold beliefs that buffer perceptions of the systemas operating on a justice principle and through heuristics or stereotypes (even when in direct opposition to one's material interests). It has very little to do with biology though, aside from being built on top of biased information processing systems.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Yes. The interactions between the mother and environment when the baby is in the womb, those between grandmother and environment when the mother is in the womb, and so on backward through time. Epigenetic changes can impact three generations at a time (mother, embryo, and the eggs in the embryo), and can also stack with epigenetic changes incurred on previous generations.\n\n\nIt's also not just the environment, but also our actions. Put two identical twins in the exact same environment but have them act differently, and they will accrue epigenetic changes based on those differences in action.\n\n\nThis is all before we look at how environment and behavior can alter the genes themselves (epigenetic changes only impact the protein around the gene), or the habit formations of neural pathways and so on.\n\n\nThere are all kinds of ways that behavior influences biology even with the mechanisms we currently understand, and if there's one thing every good scientist knows, it's that *there are always more mechanisms we don't understand yet.* It's unscientific hubris to assume otherwise.", "label": 0}
