This reductive perspective can lead to the commodification of not only goods but also people, eroding empathy and compassion in the process.

She's a strong female character in the sense that she holds her own against everyone in her social setting and is the hero who saves the day, but she saves the day using traditionally feminine traits, like being empathetic and being a good listener. She doesn't save the day by adopting masculine traits like acting intimidating or getting in a fistfight.\n\nI really liked that because to me, Louise's character and story arc contains the implication that the traditionally feminine traits are just as important for 'saving the world' as the traditionally masculine traits, and that a person can be a hero without needing to adopt traditionally masculine traits. It broadens the scope of *who gets to be a hero* in a way that's different from what happens when a woman becomes a hero by adopting traditionally masculine traits.\n\nChihiro from *Spirited Away* is another great example of this kind of a character.\n\nUnfortunately, it's really hard to find an example of a *man* being a hero and saving the day by adopting traditionally feminine traits. Jean-Luc Picard is an example of this sometimes, but certainly not in every episode of *ST:TNG*.", "label": 1}

If you only send review codes to people and media who already show you favour and don't want to upset you, then there's going to be a bias towards positive reviews. It doesn't even mean the reviewers are lying. It's like going for a job interview but all your mates are doing the interviewing and maybe one or two randoms just for show. Hence the review scores are skewed. Originally I did not think this was true and that the \"anti woke\" crowd were just crying about it, but a large number of people - respected people- have said the same thing. Unfortunately the user reviews also won't be reliable because a lot of people will review bomb it without even playing it. For me: nothing I've seen makes the game very appealing to me. I think it will fail from a financial perspective because of its DEI inclusions which we've seen so far this year REALLY really get people riled up. But time will tell.

And for the past year and a half I\u2019ve been getting back into art and have created characters with written backstories that at some point (if hardships of life will allow me) I want to use to write and produce an animated series inspired by your work. \n\nSo, again, from the bottom of my heart, Thank you so much for creating such a unique game that I hold very closely to me. \n\nOkay, now for my question.\n\nDespite how much we all wish for a Spore sequel, we have to come to terms that \u2018Spore 2\u2019 is unfortunately very unlikely to happen - is there a reason for that?
