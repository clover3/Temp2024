If you look at the polling data, the folks living in Crimea and the Donbas oblasts *overwhelmingly* voted for Victor Yanukovych, whereas folks living in Western Ukraine were pretty split on their opinion of Yanukovych. \n\nThe main reason that the West is blamed for the current state of affairs between Ukraine and Russia is that the West, particularly the United States, gave funding and arms training to the right-wing militias that eventually overthrew the Yanukovych government. They fanned the flames of the already growing dissent against pro-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.

{"text": "> the person i was discussing with kept insisting that the only reason nato exists is to \"stop russian imperialism\" \n\nThis is mostly true. NATO was formed to counter the Soviet Union, and its primary role today is a defensive alliance against Russian expansionism. \n\nIts purpose became less clear after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but became increasingly relevant after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, annexed Crimea in 2014, and finally launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n> and that theyve only really acted defensively and never offensively. \n\nThis is sort of true. They have never acted offensively with the goal of expanding some kind of NATO empire. However, they've conducted some operations that are hard to call 100% defensive \u2013 more like exp\n\n- They intervened in the Bosnian War, escalating gradually from sanctions and enforcing a no-fly zone to conducting air strikes and deploying peacekeeping troops, alongside troops from non-NATO countries, after the war ended. It is not clear that the Bosnian War had posed a direct threat to NATO countries. However, their actions were authorized by the U.N., and the air strikes were in response to the Bosnian Serb Army's massacre of Muslim civilians, the first officially recognized genocide since WWII.\n\n- NATO also intervened forcefully to end the Kosovo war, nominally because of the humanitarian crisis and ongoing war crimes. Although the U.N. had condemned Yugoslavia's actions and called for ceasefires, the Security Council did not approve military action, due to opposition from Russia and China. This was the first time NATO used military force without the endorsement of the U.N.\n\n- Article 5 (An attack on one country is an attack on all) was invoked for the first time by the United States, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. They cooperated on various operations like patrolling the US airspace and securing shipping routes.  After the US invaded Afghanistan, the U.N. established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to stabilize the capital region and help build a permanent Afghan government. NATO eventually took command of ISAF's mission at the request of both the U.N. and the Afghan government. This was the first time NATO had a mission outside of the North Atlantic region. The U.N. later expanded their mission to provide security for the entire county. Overall, Afghanistan was kind of an L.\n\n- NATO trained Iraqi security forces during the Iraq war, at their and the UN's request, without actively participating in combat.\n\n- In 2009 NATO conducted anti-piracy missions in the gulf and Indian ocean area, in cooperation with Russia and China.\n\n- In 2011 NATO intervened in Libya, almost entirely via air power, to enforce the U.N.'s mandated no-fly zone. 7 months later, Libya's ruler Gaddafi was killed by rebels, at which point the UN ended NATO's mandate for military enforcement and they pulled out shortly after that. Libyans generally supported the intervention as Gaddafi was deeply unpopular, but like Afghanistan, the state disintegrated very quickly. Its hard to call this one a success.\n\nIf you want to read more about these conflicts and others I didn't mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NATO_operations\n\nIn my personal opinion, NATO is critical for the security of western and central Europe. They do provide a very strong deterrent against Russian aggression. I also believe they should stay in their lane (defending Europe, North America, and *maybe* international shipping routes).", "label": 1}

{"text": ">How long before it becomes legitimate in your eyes? Russophones have been living in that area for over a century\n\nAnd? They can live in Russia instead. They have a home to go to. You wanna talk about time and legitimate? Let's talk about the colonial world. Let's talk about active invasions and world policing. No? Okay let's talk about immigration. If I land in a country and claim I'm a citizen does that make it valid? Or does only being born there matter? What's legitimate in YOUR eyes? Does it REALLY matter?\n\n>700k fled to Russia as refugees in 2014.\n\nAlmost like... I called it. Seee. They can leave. They can go to Russia. Why are they staying? I wonder....", "label": 1}

{"text": "I would be curious to know the specifics of what horrendous shit is suspected to come out of this.. but the republican party has a massive problem as it pertains to Trump. The character that is Donald Trump has become bigger than the party itself. It's extremely problematic and not good for anybody, not even the MAGA voters. Trump can sell the voters MAGA crowd on anything, and they believe in him so much that there's nothing you can do or say to break the mind control. $8 trillion+ in debt? \"yeah, but trump's debt is different debt is different because the money he spends makes america better...\" It's a nightmare for the party, and for everyone. In many cases, constituents will have no choice but to lay down and go along with the horrendous shit.. There will be an us vs them paradigm, of course there already is with the whole RINO label, but I'd expect it to intensify and reach new levels. Anybody in the party who isn't a yes man to trump will be viewed as an anti america first enemy, and this could have personal ramifications as well. This alone could destroy a political career.... I guess you could look at JD Vance as an example. Maybe JD Vance really has changed in the way he feels about Trump and Trump's  policies, but it almost seems like Vance is swallowing his pride, and putting on an act in order to further his career, and of course his income that comes with rising to superstardom.", "label": 1}
