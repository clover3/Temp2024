Like your hypothetical is more grounded in realism perhaps than one where voting involves sacrificing a child, but its just as divorced from reality.\n\nEven assuming Johnny is so fundamentally and completely incapable that he could only imagine casting the exact vote in the \"pre-filled sample ballot\" the \"con\" of him voting is outweighed by the fact that the democratic process is in play. Johnny's voice has been counted and the government derived from the result of it and all the others is more legitimate for it. And yes Johnny really fucking phoned this shit in by not being able to go \"hmm I could also vote this other way\" but Johnny has a connection to the political process and if Johnny hates someone he voted for he has a direct cause and effect and can pressure the candidate representing him to change, or at the very least make a less absurd choice next time.\n\nYour hypothetical requires such a weird detachment from the human condition, from the baseline capabilities of an adult with  drivers license, that it really undercuts how laughable the \"voting is bad actually\" arguments are.

But they know they can count on America to supply enough arms for a protracted conflict.\n\nSince they *can't* sustainably make arms in that quantity (being so small), and don't need to (being supplied by America), they choose to focus their efforts on making an \"oh shit\" button instead. If something goes terribly terribly wrong, they have the ability to deal catastrophic damage (disproportionate to their size) to their enemies very quickly. \n\nI known it's tempting to look at such an infrastructure and say \"Israel bad, Israel want kill everyone and take their land\" or whatever, but imo we simply need to look at the history of Israeli expansion efforts to see that this really isn't true.

{"text": "We were in a sharp decline for months before the bill was passed.  Over a point a month where in the Obama years it was a point a year.  The problem is we doubled the deficit with excess spending with no additional gains in unemployment to show for it.  \n\nWe can also compare this to the last time we had a major tax cut that included corporations.  We often hear how this is the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and the dataset above shows this was achieved after [the 1964 tax cut.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1964) There is precedent for this which is why even Obama argued to cut taxes desperate in his second term to turn around the slowest recovery in US history:\n\n>President Obama believes that business tax reform is necessary to create jobs and spur investment, but that it should come as part of a broader effort to support job creation and competitiveness that benefits the middle class.\n\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/30/fact-sheet-better-bargain-middle-class-jobs\n\nI get it.  There is a simplistic view that cutting taxes lowers revenue and vic versa, but it is not that simple.  Overtaxation is real and it will reduce revenue that appears to have been the case for the last 60 years.  Obama covers the general concept above as businesses are highly likely to invest the savings from a tax cut, they invest in employees that lowers unemployment, and that increases the tax base which has increased overall revenue from this tax cut.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I honestly don\u2019t see where you think revenue wasn\u2019t affected ? Looking at federal government tax receipts in corporate income I see it dipping pretty significantly from 2016-2017 to around 2019 then we have it sharply rise 2020-2023.\n\nThen I see the corporate profits after tax chart showing that Q3 2016 to Q1 2020 there is not much change besides a dip around the time of covid but then dramatically shooting up right after and now in 2024 Q1 corporate profits are higher than any point in time on the chart.\n\nMy sources are the FRED economic data charts. What this makes me conclude is that revenue whent down initially from the TCJA and profits weren\u2019t really affected but then after Q1 2021 we see a massive increase and I say this can\u2019t be because of the TCJA clearly something else or combination of many other effects is making corporate profit to be so high these last few years considering they didn\u2019t jump up like that for years since the TCJA\n\nI looked through some recent postings from your source the NBER and they posted in July 2024 \u201clessons from the biggest tax cut in US history\u201d they say multiple things but importantly they say \u201ccorporate tax revenue fell 40 percent due to the lower rate\u201d \u201ctotal tangible corporate investment increased by 11 percent\u201d and they say the advertised effect was much lower with long run GDP only increasing by less than 1 percent and labor income by less than 1000 percent employee.

{"text": "So on the specific topic I see a sharp decline in unemployment from April 2020 to about October 2020 then we slow down and soon after pass the bill early 2021 and it takes a full year to drop from 6 percent to 4 percent so it could be argued if the act hadn\u2019t happened I might have taken longer to go from 6 to 4 percent. When I correspond this with the inflation chart inflation is on a sharp increase ever since the 2020 cares act and continues dramatically until it starts dropping generally in 2022 telling me that both presidents and their congresses passing massive spending bills with Trump passing the CARES act then that massive spending bill that included Covid relief then all of Biden\u2019s massive bills so far in his administration. So we do literally see lowered unemployment directly after the passing of the act it\u2019s just 2 percent but remember the closer to 0 we get the harder it is to lower but also the importance of going from 6 to 4 can be pretty subjective so it could be argued was it worth it or not.\n\nI\u2019d like to touch on the 1964 tax cuts cause I believe it actually agrees with my assessment that the TCJA was poor economics so Kennedy actually got the idea of temporary deficit spending to boost growth Keynesian economics which says temporary deficit spending can boost economic growth and lower unemployment which it did however the caveat is you only want to do that when it\u2019s needed , if the economy is great and you cut taxes then you make it harder to cut taxes if suddenly the economy stumbles a bit which tells me that when Trump passed the TCJA during an objectively great economy he inherited from Obama then it was poor economics if we follow those same principles from 1964s decision and yes Obama was following those principles by wanting to cut taxes during his recession too. Donald Trump cutting taxes during a good may cause some small growth in certain spots but it is arguably unnecessary and makes it harder to now really spend in a defecit when something bad happens with the economy", "label": 0}

{"text": "The FRED dataset above was to all revenue and not just corporate taxes.  The previous trend is quite important for there to be two years of sharply declining overall revenue and then to bunk that trend to a static trend after TCJA was implemented.  The CBO has that data if you are interested from the same report above:\n\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/58147#_idTextAnchor168\n\n(Again, hit the link again if it doesn\u2019t go straight to the dataset. There site is a bit wonky.)\n\nThanks for the source as I was unaware they had second version of the study.  I\u2019ll have to review this in detail as this looks like a perfect example of how politics infect research.  I got to see how exactly they went from a static effect on corporate tax revenue to now a 40% drop as that is huge.  The first report was quite critical to say it was static overall as the CBO dataset shows corporate tax revenue followed the trend in overall revenue after implementing the TCJA.  I suspect they are comparing it to the economic bubble in the mid-2000s which of course would be a bad baseline for comparison.  Still, this research is just on the corporate tax cut alone and the overall effect is unchanged.  Be it 11% or 20% increase in corporate investment or static to 40% decline in corporate revenue the overall results remain the same.  We still got an historical low unemployment rate while increasing overall revenue.  That is a huge win-win for a tax policy to bring those job numbers while also increasing revenue.", "label": 0}

Yet this was bipartisan spending and the situation would have been much worse without it after shutting down the economy.  Still short term and spending likely would have returned to preCOVID levels of spending if the Trump Administration got a second term.  We didn\u2019t and the Biden Admin doubled the deficit.

Be careful as that is in raw dollars that can be deceptive.  It doesn\u2019t account for the value of the dollar.  In the short term it isn\u2019t so bad, but with surging inflation that does gets quite bad.  Notice the CBO dataset on revenue types split out is based on GDP which is much more stable data.

Attributing the 19 percent number to the TCJA is ridiculous considering that 2 years of the TCJA results in no increases of tax revenue as a percentage of GDP but then magically Covid and soaring business profits after Covid suddenly make it jump so obviously TCJA was a non factor in getting that number to 19 percent there\u2019s no possible genuine way to say TCJA caused it when TWO YEARS kept it steady.\n\n3. Trump ran some of the highest deficits in history and literally had the record for highest deficit of all time to say Biden spent too much money is agreeable but to say his spending was solely bad and solely the cause of inflation is ridiculous considering he spent less money on covid relief compared to Trump and the economy was shut down right after Trump passed massive amounts of money meaning the effects wouldn\u2019t be felt until it opened back up.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This is a completely ridiculous take tbh so we wanna say that due to delays in pay offs from investments that\u2019s why 2 straight years the number goes down then soon as economy crashes and begins to reopen and we have all kinds of issues such as high demand high inflation massive amounts of stimulus in the economy resulting in historically high corporate profits causing this increase in revenue. This all must be due to the TCJA 4 years ago as of 2022??? That makes no sense this also forgets all the wage increases people have and inflation pushing them into higher brackets increasing their taxes there\u2019s a myriad of reasons for this but somehow magically the TCJA caused this lol.\n\nI would agree with the argument if this was maybe 8 years after the act and we could see this consistent effect happening but to see a dramatic increase 2 years after the fact makes no sense and no reasonable economist would attribute that to the TCJA when MANY other factors spiked at the same time I guess since inflation spiked 2 years after that must be because of the TCJA too lol", "label": 0}
{"text": "Apparently we spent most of the time here discussing not the main counter argument.  Those were mentioned one or maybe twice and moves away from the data provided.\n\n1. It was not a great economy as it was shrinking as evident to a sharp decline in revenue for three years prior to the TCJA.  The FRED dataset show recessions marked in gray and significant periods of sharply declining revenue almost always precedes recessions.  That would make it the best time to spur corporate investment to stave off a recession.  Regardless, the timing couldn\u2019t have been better for having the lowest unemployment rate before a government mandated economic shutdown.\n\n2.  It is ridiculous to attribute the 19% of GDP revenue to nothing given the history significance.  How is an overhaul in tax policies so detached from the resulting changes in revenue?  It was a two year peak in revenue that was mostly likely economic gains from COVID that were delayed from the 2020 shutdowns.\n\n3. The CBO dataset clearly shows Trump had the least deficits of the 21st century outside of a year with a global pandemic and governor mandated lockdowns.  Biden had the worst in US history as the longterm deficit has been doubled for the next decade at least according to the 2024 CBO Budget Outlook Report provided above mainly from partisan spending.  This is despite a revenue being above the historical average under current law from the TCJA.  The COVID spending was also short term bipartisan while the Biden spending was heavily partisan mainly passed through reconciliation for the next decade.  We have three years of Trump budgeting to analyze outside of a crisis to determine it was quite reasonable to keep spending static in response to trend in revenue.  We have 3.75 years of Biden budgeting to analyze to determine is was quite reckless to double the deficit which saddle us with record high inflation.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I see this remains the top up-voted response which, to paraphrase, says \"the only reason 2000 was interesting was because the Supreme Court stopped the recount\", but this seems an incredibly unsatisfying sentiment. The 2020 election was extremely interesting itself, due to a variety of factors, including the unprecedented adoption of mail in voting.\n\nWe know mail in voting is subject to problems counting votes, also from New York Times:\n\n[Error and Fraud at Issue as Absentee Voting Rises](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/us/politics/as-more-vote-by-mail-faulty-ballots-could-impact-elections.html)\n\n>Yet votes cast by mail are less likely to be counted, more likely to be compromised and more likely to be contested than those cast in a voting booth, statistics show. Election officials reject almost 2 percent of ballots cast by mail, double the rate for in-person voting.\n\n>  \nIn the last presidential election, 35.5 million voters requested absentee ballots, but only 27.9 million absentee votes were counted, according to\u00a0[a study](http://www.law.nyu.edu/journals/legislation/issues/volume13number3/ECM_PRO_068045)\u00a0by Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He calculated that 3.9 million ballots requested by voters never reached them; that another 2.9 million ballots received by voters did not make it back to election officials; and that election officials rejected 800,000 ballots. That suggests an overall failure rate of as much as 21 percent.\n\nMany states were contested with less than 2% difference between the candidates.\n\nUltimately, in 2001, if the New York Times did not publish the landmark investigative reporting they published as part of that article, we would never have known about the process abuses committed during the Florida election. The public would be in the dark. Considering the vast amount of lawsuits, discovery, and information about the 2020 election, I was hoping there was a similar deep dive on the level of 2001 in Florida, but it appears there unfortunately isn't.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Great. Let's go through it...\n\nTo begin with, under the neutrality requirements of Rule B, we don't allow questions that solicit just one side of an argument. So, you could ask about the pros and cons of such sites, but not take a position and then ask respondents to argue against it. Subreddits like r/changemyvew are set up to handle that style of discussion. Posts here must be neutral. Questions framed in the negative (*Isn't the premise fundamentally flawed?*) should also be eliminated, because they are also considered leading, not neutral.\n\nSecond, per Rule D, anything phrased as a factual claim needs a link to a source, including, but not limited to, statements about the roots of such models and the current status of their probabilities.\n\nFinally, and perhaps fundamentally, I think there's a little bit of conflation here between \"poll aggregators\" and \"election prediction models.\" Poll aggregators are largely understood to be simply what they sound like: aggregators of polls. They may include a bit of weighting, but they pretty much just present all the relevant polls and come up with an average. Some examples are: [RealClear Polling](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) and [this one at The Hill](https://elections2024.thehill.com/national/harris-trump-general/).\n\nElection prediction models, by contrast, do a lot of weighting, consider a bunch of other factors (like historical trends and events influencing individual races), and most importantly, try to distill it all down into probabilities of victory. Some examples are: [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/) and [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president/).\n\nAggregators don't present win probability. And while election prediction models may disclose the polls they're using to feed into their models, their goal isn't to present a pure average.\n\nSo, if you decide to rework this, it'd be important to distinguish which one you're asking about.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, just reply here, and thanks for participating.", "label": 0}

They're looking at what the executive branch agencies can do in the absence of a specific law limiting the practice.\n\nA federal ban, as Harris proposes, would likely mirror the laws many states already have, which means it would require Congressional legislation. But the Democratic party doesn't hold the House of Representatives right now, so they can't even get a bill to the floor. They did draft and introduce a [House bill in 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7736/text) and a [Senate bill in 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/355), but those didn't get out of committee.\n\nLegislating is hard, but just because it hasn't gotten done doesn't mean people aren't working on it. With an evenly split Congress, only bills with some degree of bipartisan support have any hope of passing.\n\nThe other aspect of this situation is the campaigning component. There's a little rhetorical campaign trick that happens in elections like this. The opposition talks constantly about everything that's wrong with the current administration, then tries to tie the candidate from that administration to its policies, saying she's \"more of the same.\" But if she breaks from those policies or proposes something new, the same people ask, \"Why isn't she doing that stuff already?\" \n\nSo, it's a no-win situation. Whether the candidate holds course or does something new, they're criticized. This is just how politics works and the campaigners count on the fact that people won't get wise to the logical inconsistencies.\n\nI hope that answers your question.

{"text": "> * If predictive models are simply summing up and weighing error-prone polls, how does such a summation result in a more accurately framed \"probability\" for election outcomes?\n\nThere are two kinds of errors in polls: sampling errors and non-sampling errors.\n\nSurveys try to be representative of the population in question, and for polls the population in question are usually either the set of registered voters (RV; you tend to find these being emphasized a few weeks or more out from the election) or the set of electors who are going to cast votes by the end of election day i.e. likely voters (LV; you tend to find these being headlined close to election day).\n\nFor a particular election let's say that the population in question is completely evenly split 50/50 between parties D and R.  If you survey 2 people from that population then it's two coin flips: there's a 25% chance you get a response of 0% D / 100% R, a 50% chance of 50% D / 50% R, and a 25% chance of 100% D / 0% R.\n\nStatistics is a well-developed field of mathematics, and these kind of results (even if the population isn't 50/50 split) follow a binomial distribution which when you get towards larger numbers (N = a few score interviews or more, typically) can be approximated by the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).\n\nPolls exist because it's prohibitively expensive to interview all of the millions upon millions of people who might possibly vote and most won't tell you anyway.  So you interview a couple hundred or a thousand or so instead, and use the normal distribution to calculate what the sampling errors are because dumb luck will mean that you happened to contact a slightly larger fraction of blue voters than red voters than exist in the actual full population.\n\nSo this sampling error is what you find quoted as the margin of error (MoE) of a poll, usually the 95th percentile i.e. given that this N = 1000 poll might have a \u00b13% MoE and says D 49% / 51% R, there's a 95% chance that the underlying population is somewhere between D 46 / 54 R and D 52 / 48 R.  That sort of thing.  To find out that the actual vote is outside of this range should only happen 1 time in 20.  The MoE drops by \u221a2 for every time you double the number N of interviews, so the bigger N the smaller the sampling error.\n\nIt's slightly more complicated than that because of weighting (i.e. putting more or less weight on a particular individual's responses so that the sample as a whole looks more like the known population from e.g. census data, but that can be accounted for statistically as well.\n\nNon-sampling errors come from issues that are hard to control for.  For example, are Republican voters or Democratic voters more likely to answer your questions via your chosen method of surveying them?  Are one or the other more likely to lie to you?  These are very difficult to control for - there are ways to try, but they have become a progressively bigger problem for pollsters as the response rate has dropped and differences in response rates have risen.\n\nDoing math on a big bunch of published polls by aggregators aims to reduce the sampling error by essentially adding them up into a bigger N.  It can kind of do something - maybe - about non-sampling error if half of the pollsters have mucked up their sampling method one way and the other half the other way.  If there's a proper diversity of methodologies then that can help a bit.\n\n538's model famously has some fudge factor built in to try to account for non-sampling errors that might affect large swathes of the polling industry.  That's why some aggregators who only considered the published sampling errors of polls said Clinton was 95+% likely to win in 2016 while 538 put it at only 70%.\n\n> * How are elections \"probabilistic outcomes\"? The election will be determined by voters - there is no skill, chance, or luck involved, and certainly not to the degree of something like a professional sports match.\n\n\"If the election results are going to be X% vs Y% then there's a 95% probability that our N = 1000 poll result is within 3 percentage points of that.  Our result is X\u2081% vs Y\u2081%, so X and Y are almost certainly within 3% of those values.\"  Poll aggregators transform a bunch of those into probabilities that X > Y, or X < Y, or X = Y, where X and Y are each candidate's EC vote counts, or the number of Senators or Representatives each party is going to wind up with in Congress.\n\n> * If a predictive model can't really tell who wins the election at 70%+ probability, then what value does it provide and what insight does it provide and what value does it add to the conversation? I understand a 30% chance of something happening is a far cry from \"impossible\" but what value does it add when we can simply look at polls to understand who is likely to be ahead?\n\nWhen 538 told us that Clinton was 70% likely to win in 2016 it was essentially saying that it wouldn't be surprising at all if either candidate won and we should temper our expectations accordingly.\n\n> * Would we be better served and informed by looking at individual polls to make a guess at who is ahead?\nWhat do the \"predictive models\" add to the conversation?\n\nThey make N bigger to reduce sampling errors and generally add a fudge factor for non-sampling errors which you're not going to get from any individual poll.   A dose of skepticism that a poll (or a plain mathematical aggregate of them) showing a lead outside the MoE necessarily means that there's an actual lead rather than a problem with how the samples were collected.\n\nIf you're really into things then they can tell you something very valuable: where your GOTV efforts or your political donations are the most likely to result in a difference to the ultimate end result.  For example, the polls are showing a tighter Senate race in Ohio than Montana, but if you want to make the biggest bang in the 119th Congress given a fixed time and money budget then you should throw them into the latter because you don't have to persuade as many people in order to change the outcome since MT has many fewer voters overall.  Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Project [has the calculated per-vote power in the side bar there](https://election.princeton.edu/) and [Vote Maximizer](https://votemaximizer.org/) lets you investigate the same on an interactive map.\n\nOf course, major parties are doing exactly this kind of modeling all the time (as well as their own internal surveys) in order to try to figure out where their candidates' time and money are best spent to maximize their chances of victory.", "label": 0}

{"text": "\\> Polls are trying to assess voter intention, but voter intention is not like a coin flip or a sporting event. The concept of \"if we ran 3 elections, Harris wins 2 and Trump wins 1\" is non-sensical - the voters aren't going to be flipping their votes en-masse in some non-deterministic way. It isn't like a coin flip or a sports game.\n\nPolls try to assess voter intention but 538's model doesn't. Here's a really basic example model that uses two factors:\n\n\\- Pollster X says Clinton will win PA. This pollster is accurate 90% of the time.\n\n\\- The winner of PA has won the election 80% of the time. \n\nI know Pollster X is right 9 out of 10 times. I don't know when they'll be right or wrong. Polling takes skill, and pollsters can randomly screw up.\n\nI know how often the winner of PA wins the election. I don't know which years though.\n\nSo I would predict that 72 out of 100 elections, Clinton should win.\n\nA better way to look at it: \"Out of 100 elections, the candidate whom Pollster X predicts will win PA should win the election 72 times. This means there's a 72% chance that this is one of those elections.\"\n\nOr: \"Historically, when candidates have met conditions A and B, they have won 72 out of 100 elections.\" This isn't exactly accurate but it's the basic idea.", "label": 0}

They may only be set up to do this work for a week or so for budgetary reasons.\n\nThere's also the possibility that the count, though unreported, could be leaked.\n\nBut generally, some degree of pre-canvassing (examining, verifying and sorting the ballots) is done in most states, which speeds up the process even in those that don't count until election day. [Here's an article](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-mail-ballots-precanvassing-101/) explaining why pre-canvassing is not done in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.

{"text": ">How are elections \"probabilistic outcomes\"? The election will be determined by voters - there is no skill, chance, or luck involved, and certainly not to the degree of something like a professional sports match.\n\nElections are probabilistic because a lot of tiny little random things happen to determine who actually makes it to the polls -- whether you get a flat tire that morning, whether you over sleep, whether you run into your friend who convinces you to go and vote together, and so on.\n\nBut, you can model things using probability even where there is no randomness involved.  Suppose you're taking a history test.  It asks \"Who was the 9th president of the United States\": A) Bill Clinton, B) Andrew Jackson C) William Henry Harrison, or D) Zachary Taylor.\n\nThere's no randomness here whatsoever, and no prediction either.  This is something that has already happened.  But you probably don't know the answer for sure.  Maybe you're a presidency buff and already know this one, but most people would look at the question, and not be sure.  So it would be perfectly sensible to say, \"I think there's a 60% chance it's Andrew Jackson\" or \"I'm 100% sure it's not Bill Clinton, but I'm just guessing randomly among the others.\"  These are perfectly reasonable uses of what's called [Bayesian probability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4158865/).  You're using probability not to predict a \"random\" outcome like a coin flip, but rather to describe your own degree of belief in something.  \n\nSo, let's imagine you're right and the outcome of the election is completely deterministic; ignore all those random factors above.  We are still in the position of not knowing who will win with certainty, and we can quantify the information available to us as a probability.\n\n>Would we be better served and informed by looking at individual polls to make a guess at who is ahead?\n\nThe rest of your questions really seem like riffs on this one.\n\nSo, let's say we look at an individual poll.  Which one? Look at all these [recents polls in PA](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-harris).  The Hill/Emerson has Trump up by 1 point.  Muhlenberg College has Harris up by 2 points.  Which poll should we pick? \n\nIf you answer is some form of \"let's look at all of them\" or \"let's look at the ones that are especially good polls by some criteria\" then you're just informally recreating a predictive model.   A predictive model is just a more rigorous way of taking a bunch of polls and trying to figure what they're telling you when you put them all together.\n\nThat only takes you so far.  Even taking all the polls put together, there's only so much information in them.  And so, once you aggregate that, you may be left with answers that still have a lot of gaps.  But you're still better off looking at all the information you have instead of just picking and choosing.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The mistake you are making is thinking that the \"random event\" is the voter action. If we knew the voter action, there would be no need for a model at all. What a model does is translate data like polls into some statement about reality like an electoral outcome. In that sense, the \"random event\" is the poll. If you poll people Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, there is a very high chance that each day your poll will have different results. That is partly because polls are attempting to randomly sample the population. It's partly because polls sometimes play a role in people's decision (e.g. people pointing to Biden's declining polls as a reason for wanting him to drop out or Clinton's high poll margin as an excuse to stay home from voting). It's partly because the way the polls is designed may impact how people answer or who even responds. It's partly because pollsters will have blind spots to these things. But when you add it all up, each of these polls is going to have some probability of every kind of error and some probability of every amount of \"bad\" random sampling. This probability is what you're generally talking about. So, it's almost looking at it backward: Suppose Trump is going to win, what are the odds that we would have \"randomly\" sampled people in such a way that said he was down by 2 points? And you can look at enough different polls with that question that you aren't looking at one event, you're looking at thousands of events.\n\nHowever, it's still true that the voter actions have some probability attached to them. The idea that every voter knows exactly who they will vote for and noting can happen that will change their mind is false. There is some probability that Bob is going to see the right attack the morning of polls that make him change his mind on something. There is some probability that Jane is going to be tired from working late and decide voting doesn't matter. There is some probability that a major world event will occur that changes people's focus as they rank candidates. Etc. Studies shows that the order of candidate names on a ballot impacts how many votes they get (which is why some states rotate the candidate positions from ballot to ballot). If something that meaningless impacts voter actions, clearly, these other kinds of random events that occur and are of more substance will influence voter behaviors.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while one election is one event, people who create models can run their model on many different elections under the presumption that a good model will do well at predicting the most elections (state, local, federal, mid term, special, etc.) or even that it will do well at predicting \"similar\" elections (e.g. recent elections, elections with similar candidates/issues).", "label": 0}

Because we don't, we have a very simplistic model that just gives us a 50% chance, and some more sophisticated ones that show that if it starts facing a certain side, it'll be a tiny bit over 50%.  It's very accurate. \n\nThis works in the same way for the population.  The more information we have, the better we can guess on who will win the election. In general, the fact that we can't is not due to a model failing, but lack of information. \n\n> It is almost 100% voter intention\n\nIt may appear that way, but even if you could poll 100% of the voters, you're not factoring in time.

Neither specifically mentions Section 8.\n\nThe Trump plan doesn't have any instances of the word \"rent.\" It mentions housing costs in general and says it will improve affordability by reducing immigration (p.7). This is the entirety of the section on Housing Affordability (p.10):\n\n> To help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal\nLands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time\nbuyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs.\n\nThe economic portion of the Harris platform alone is nearly six times as long as the entire Trump platform. Chapter 7 (p.36) is titled, \"Help Americans Buy a Home and Afford Rent.\" It's too long to excerpt all the of the relevant parts, but here are some highlights...\n\nIt aims to address high rents by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and increasing supply. There's also an \"innovation fund\" idea to help state and local governments build more affordable housing, plus a section about taking on abusive corporate landlords who drive up prices. Finally, there's a plan to convert renters to buyers by helping them save for their downpayments. I encourage anyone interested in this topic to read the whole section.\n\nAs an aside, it's notable that the comparative specificity of the two housing plans carries across to other issues. The Harris platform is pretty detailed and specific on all the issues it covers, while the Trump plans are extremely brief and vague. The contrast is pretty shocking when you dig into it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I don't think the base was disillusioned, I think the base was apathetic. For a variety of reasons, inflation hurt even if it's not dems fault people are simple they blame the party in charge and democrats unlike republicans don't flip their economic view simply based on who is in office. The war in Gaza hurt because Democrats represent a large jewish base who support israels right to exist and also a left leaning base who is openly hostile to the existence of israel. So walking a tight rope of saying we have empathy for palestine while supporting israel was a herculean task. The War in ukraine is honestly the biggest failure on messaging from my perspective because they failed to concisely detail why the importance of democracy overseas is an American issue. Somehow the same base that thinks genocide is happening in Gaza can't see the Genocide happening in Ukraine... It's ridiculous. All while trying to grapple with keeping the rust belt and union voters who have moved into an extreme protectionist bend that is outright harmful to the US economy... Democrats try to argue from reality and it forces us to have to have complex nuanced positions, whereas trump won people by simply denying it and offering simple solutions. Protectionism 20% tariff that will raise enough taxes to eliminate income tax and also lower the cost of goods. Ukraine I will solve it day 1 . I wont tell you how lol.

{"text": "OK, but just to provide an example, here's what a version that complies with Rule 2 would look like:\n\n----\n\nIt has to do with [confidence intervals.](https://www.statology.org/confidence-intervals/) If you poll every person in the US, you will know the result with 100% certainty. If you only poll half, you\u2019re not sure what the other half will do.  Using what you know and what you don\u2019t know, you can use statistics to come up with a decision with a certain percentage of certainty.\n\nThe main reason predictive models are helpful in an election is they can tell when there is no hope. For example, the [polls said that Biden had no chance,](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/politics/trump-biden-election-cnn-poll-takeaways/index.html) so they made a change. You will never be able to use a poll to know the outcome of an election.\n\nThe problem with polling now is that [people are afraid to say they are Republican](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370649/trust-polls-2016-2020-election-2024-pollster-polling-miss) because of cancel culture. So they keep their mouth shut and they\u2019re under representative in the data.
