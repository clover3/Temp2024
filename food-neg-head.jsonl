Slice the top off the bulbs of garlic so that every clove of the garlic is exposed. Place on a small square of tin foil and drizzle with olive oil. Fold the edges of the tin foil together and twist and make a completely sealed bundle. \n\nPlace the garlic in the oven and roast until it is golden brown and tender, about 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. \n\nSqueeze the roasted garlic into a small dish. \nMelt the butter in a heavy large sauce pan over medium high heat. \n\nAdd the onions, turmeric, sage, and Cayenne. Then cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nAdd the roasted garlic and the garlic paste and cook, stirring off in, 2 to 5 minutes. \n\nAdd the chicken stock. Cover and simmer until garlic is very tender, about 45 minutes.\n\nUsing an immersion blender or regular blender, puree until smooth and creamy. \n\nAdd the cream in lemon juice. Bring to a simmer. Season the salt and pepper to taste. \n\nLadle one inch of the soup into a skillet and bring to a shimmer over medium heat. Four at a time, carefully crack the eggs into the pan and poach for about 3 minutes. \n\nTo serve, places, slice of toast in each soup and top with a poached egg. Ladle the soup over the eggs and sprinkle with Parmesan and chives.", "label": 0}

{"text": "automod ate comment, cant link the fat separators.  I'll say that one has a spout at the bottom that rises to the top, and one has a release valve at the bottom to let gravity do 100% of the work\n\n>Any and all knowledge is valuable\n\nDope!  I shall infodump away and you can take whatever suits your needs best :D\n\nI'll say the cold butter off heat is the best result as you're usually reducing the liquid already so it'll be hot.  wait a lil bit so its not bubbling hot, and pan off heat you can just swirl the pan and it'll move the butter around and ambient heat will incorporate it. \n\nWith a braise, I've always considered getting a fat separator that [pours from the bottom]or [has a release for higher accuracy] to prevent the bad(I forget word) fat from being in the sauce.  it doesn't mix as easily as butter and usually doesn't taste good.  They're different fats and I forget what the difference is.  Even easier is letting it chill overnight, which often makes the braise even better, and then just pull the solid fat off, but, fat separator for same-day is a huge saver.\n\nI used to try adding unflavored gelatin to a store bought stock, and it kinda worked and helped, but my cousin (fancypants chef) made fun of me for it and told me to just use butter.  Starch/water then boil is probably the easiest/most common \"fuckit\" method but runs the risk of not cooking out the flavor of flour.  The butter method just makes it even better, because butter makes better.\n\nI'm sure you already know some of this tho.  keep on enjoying delicious food!", "label": 0}

Not to the extent of bugs but you get the point, I didn't mind eating unusual or questionable looking foods. However, recently I've been growing more pickier, especially with textures. I don't know why it's happening since I wasn't raised to be picky, but certain textures make me shudder. For example, I used to like eating tuna with crackers a lot. It is a very nostalgic food for me but now I can't stand it. The smell and the texture absolutely disgusts me now. Its a bit sad for me since it was a childhood food attached with memories but I can't change how I feel. The same is happening with shrimp too. I used to eat that shit up but the texture is fucking with me now. I don't want to be this way but its something I genuinely can't help. I came to this Reddit to see if there was anyone like me who is suddenly becoming so picky with things. I'm very curious as to why its happening since there isn't really any noticeable reason that I can scrutinize. My body just reacts on its own, even though I used to be okay with eating things I didn't like just to not be hungry.", "label": 0}

Just as a counterpoint, it can happen in things that are relatively lean, like in cod fish for instance, which can be poached very gently for not very long and still reach that point where it will separate into flakes at a push. Land animal red meats only do this when it's a cut where these structures are present. Something really lean can still become very, very tender, to the point of muscle fiber being so soft that that they can be \"mushed\", but that \"falling apart\" thing is all about the separation of bundles by dissolving connections between them or with bone.", "label": 0}
