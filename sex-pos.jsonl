So you asked for proof women share dick pics, I made the claim, I do shoulder the burden of evidence.  Fine I find one example of a woman sharing a dick pic and you immediately say it isn't real.  I'm not omnipresent, I don't claim to be, I cannot scan every group chat to dox an example for you, all I can find are personal admissions of the behavior I just described, one piece of evidence is all that's required to show there could be more, at this point you've slid into an unreasonable burden of proof. Despite that, you seem to think I have no idea how to behave around other people and want me to go roll in the dirt, I'm not an astronaut, I haven't lost the hum of the earth.\n2. If you aren't given expressed consent then its not consentual.  There is no assumption of consent when sharing content of any kind.  I hate to break it to you, but the first 3 seasons of Spartacus are grossly pornographic, sharing a DVD with a friend without getting the actors/actresses expressed consent, so a written authorization, would by your own logic be required for anyone to share this content legally. I'm not dismissing consent in general, I'm pointing out how Ludacris the concept of a human needing consent to share confidential information is.  If that was the default NDAs wouldn't be necessary, because it would be assumed anything shared with another person wouldn't be shared around, thats not the assumption, which is why people keep secrets.\n3. \"What makes you think tons of women are ridiculing dick pics in group chats? Why the whataboutism? Just admit those men are disgusting. You don't have to defend every single thing a man does just because he's a man.\" -your words\n4. It is whataboutism, because idc enough to go nuclear on this dude or his friends, and the consequences for OP doing so aren't worth the effort.

It includes all the small things you do for each other each day, the way you speak to each other, the way you make each other laugh, the compliments you give each other etc.\n\nLOTS of physical/sensual foreplay is required immediately prior to penetration, some women require 15-30 mins of it. This can be kissing, cuddling, exploring each others bodies, compliments, making her feel safe.\n\nCommunication is key. Talk to her. You don\u2019t have to say \u2018sex with you is boring\u2019, start with a new position, try mutual masturbation, try watching each other masturbate, try watching porn together, or you use the toy on her.

To persuade them to hurt you less badly.  \n\nHeck, when I was a middle school girl there had been some teen rape abductions near us in the news and my mother very painfully told me that if it came to it, playing along with a man is sometimes better than ending up dead.  Explicitly teaching me how to mitigate the damage and survive. \n\nThis ends up really toxic because a victim can end up feeling as though they complied or were complicit in the act.  Sometimes even returning to the abuser repeatedly, as they've been told to do.   \n\nBoth men's and women's bodies can have sexual response in rape situations.

{"text": "Let's talk about the concept of \"easing off the brakes\" rather than just pushing the accelerator. Sometimes, the key to unlocking pleasure is about removing the mental blocks or anxieties that hold us back. Try focusing on savoring the sensations without the pressure of reaching an orgasm. Think of it like a gourmet meal\u2014you wouldn't rush through it, right? Take time to enjoy each bite, or in this case, each sensation. Another fun technique is to flip the script on yourself. Tell yourself that you're not allowed to orgasm (or, if you are open to exploring something kinky with a partner, they can tell you you're \"not allowed to cum\")! It sounds counterintuitive, but this can actually take the pressure off and allow you to focus more on the sensations building up in your body.\nAlso, explore different types of stimulation. The clitoris is a powerhouse of nerve endings, but orgasms can also come from other places like the G-spot, A-spot, or even through nipple stimulation. Sometimes, a blended approach can unlock new orgasmic pathways. By shifting your focus to the pleasure of the moment and experimenting with different sensations, you might find that orgasms come more freely and with less effort. If you're interested in diving deeper, I have a whole [book](https://kennethplay.com/book/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=forums&utm_campaign=book) on female pleasure, with plenty of techniques and insights.

{"text": "Congratulations! I am in a similar situation as you. The past year, I have been having more sex with my wife at 41. I can think of some reasons why I am lasting longer, these may work for you:  \n\\- Prolonged foreplay reduces my arousal, cos I get hard then soft multiple times. My job is less stressful now so I have time to give her massages while she breastfeeds the baby.  \n\\-  I masturbate on days we don't have sex, in total I cum 5-6 days a week. I find this makes me last much longer, to the point where sex is almost unstimulating and more like a workout, almost mechanical.  \n\\- I try to tire myself by lifting her a little or going for as long as possible until i'm exhausted. I find that the additional strain reduces my arousal but doesn't affect the hardness. My wife also loves the idea that I'm working out!  \n\\- If I feel like cumming, I stop, pull out and give her oral.\n\nOn average, there's a 1 in 3 chance I cannot cum. Partly due to age, partly due to my recent ejaculation I'm too 'spent' or not hard enough, partly because my wife would be dry already after the multiple Os and prolonged sex and she wants to stop. She would have orgasmed several times already.\n\nI find that focusing on her and not myself is key to prolonging my erection and the overall experience. Whether or not I orgasm isn't important to us anymore. When we were younger, she was a school badminton player and I was a skinny nerd, yet she'd please me every way possible. Now she's flabby after 4 children, still works 40h a week, but I have 15kg more muscle and workout almost daily. I am glad to be paying it back =)))", "label": 1}
