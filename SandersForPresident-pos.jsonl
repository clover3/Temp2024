Like in NY,  you had to be registered as a Democrat months in advanced, before most people even had that in there mind. I had to register as Democrat in California to avoid the confusion of how to vote as an independent(take in mind most states don't have that option). Been randomly deregistered as Democrat and registered as a Green Party voter in California.  Had to re-register as Democrat again to vote.  I consider myself a left wing independent, but reluctantly am a registered Democrat because I would like to easily participate in the primaries. I still check my registration out of paranoia.", "label": 1}

It's the only radical leadership around. The left is non-existent in this country. They all cave and collaborate with the liberals at the end of the day.\n\nIf Sanders had half a spine like Trump does he'd have broken with the democrats when they sabotaged him at the primaries and asked all the unions in this country to endorse him in a new independent party, but he had neither the brains nor courage to do so.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Bingo.\n\nI can't help to wonder if this subreddit is supported by Trump/Russia itself, this shit plays right into keeping a democrat out of the white house. Sanders opposed to what many here like to believe stood no chance. Hillary got without a doubt cheated out of the white house by voters who didn't vote, voters who voted for Trump out of spite, voters who voted green, all the dumb shit you can have happened. Now you can blame everyone and everything for what happened, but if *you* didn't vote for Hillary, that's on you, not on Hillary.\n\nTo argue Biden, Hillary or Kamala are worse contenders for the White house than Sanders shows a complete disconnect of reality and again it just plays into what Trump needs, people not voting for what's right.", "label": 1}
