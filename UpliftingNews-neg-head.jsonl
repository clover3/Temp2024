{"text": "I disagree. Giving people money they didn't earn leads to inflation. Cutting taxes does not. \n\nAllow me to explain. There are two components to the economy, supply and demand, and when they operate approximately in balance, life is pretty good. Everyone is consuming things (which is inevitable ... we must have food, shelter and clothing) but nearly everyone is producing things, too. To spend $1, I first have to earn that dollar and thus put a dollar's worth of goods or services back into the economy for someone else to purchase. \n\nWhen the government borrows money and gives it to people didn't earn it, it spikes the \"demand\" side of the teeter-totter. Now people can spend more without necessarily producing more. You wind up with too many dollars chasing too few goods, and that leads to inflation, as sellers are able to raise their prices to vacuum up all of the extra money in circulation. (We saw this happen with food prices after the billions allocated to the SNAP program were doubled between 2019-2023.) \n\nLetting people keep more of the money they've earned (tax cuts) doesn't have the same effect. It doesn't create \"new money\" the way borrowing does. The same amount of money is still in circulation; the only differences is that it's being spent by the people who earned it and not the government that confiscated it via taxes. \n\nI generally agree with you on military spending but we're living in dangerous times. Israel and Iran are attacking each other and North Korean soldiers are training in Russia, presumably to join the fray in Ukraine. Our senile president and feckless vice president have been utterly incompetent in addressing the international situation, putting us all in peril.

{"text": "Let\u2019s get to the root of it\u2014healthcare in America has become an outlier among first-world nations. Most other developed countries provide healthcare to their citizens as a fundamental right, not as a privilege tied to employment. For a society that prides itself on independence and innovation, why have we trapped so many working Americans in jobs solely for benefits like healthcare? This dependency on employer-provided insurance doesn\u2019t support freedom; it\u2019s a tether.\n\nTrue freedom includes the right to live without the constant anxiety of medical costs wiping out your savings or debt dictating your future. Healthcare isn\u2019t about handouts; it\u2019s about providing stability so people can invest back into the economy, start businesses, and support their families without health being the gamble. And, for anyone who worries that government-provided healthcare will diminish job incentives, consider this: better health creates a stronger workforce. If corporations in the 1950s promised health benefits to attract talent, why shouldn\u2019t we raise the standard and make healthcare a guarantee in 2024?\n\nThe decline in union power didn\u2019t start with the social programs of the \u201960s. It began with policies favoring corporate interests and outsourcing that undercut bargaining power. Imagine if more workers had health security\u2014unions might have thrived even more, able to negotiate for better wages without the baggage of healthcare coverage in the mix.\n\nThe call for universal healthcare isn\u2019t about \u2018waiting on the government\u2019\u2014it\u2019s about finally catching up to the rest of the developed world on a moral and economic level. This isn\u2019t about ideology. It\u2019s about progress that supports every worker, every family, and the country as a whole.

Which, I guess if you think you should be subsidized by the sick, poor, and elderly then, I guess I disagree?

Not every set is going to be like this of course, but on average, price per piece hasn't been rising dramatically or anything.\n\nThe other reason is their adults-welcome push, which I think started even before that branding. That meant bigger sets that are aimed at people who either have a lot of money to spend on it OR people who buy lego once or twice a year. It's annoying, but some of the adult sets are pretty good value, the botanical ones are great for example.\n\nSo too many big sets combined with inflation gives the impression that lego is wildly more expensive when it used to be when it's really not the case.\n\nHonestly lego pricing is pretty all over that place sometimes, so it's best to look at it on a set by set basis, sometimes a set will be horribly priced while another will be priced quite cheap. For some of the best value I'd look into sets and themes aimed at kids. Lego city and friends have some great sets that are amazing value. The recent city construction vehicles look great and are priced really well. Even licenced themes are priced pretty good sometimes, like the falcon I mentioned earlier but a great example is the new fortnite sets, they are priced extremely competitively.", "label": 0}

Much of that spending was triggered by Trump\u2019s travel, or the travel of his family and aides.*\n\n*$17,000 per month for a cottage*\n\n*Trump\u2019s club in Bedminster, N.J., charges the Secret Service $17,000 a month, every month, from May to November each year. The reason: the Secret Service uses a cottage on the club grounds, near the cottages that Trump and his daughter Ivanka use.These rental charges \u2014 which are unusually high for homes in the area \u2014 continue whether Trump or his family are present or not.

Trump\u2019s Miami resort was the biggest beneficiary, collecting $274,000, followed by his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey with $266,000 and one of his Scottish resorts with $181,000. At least $760,000 of taxpayer money was disbursed at properties Trump owns entirely. The rest went to businesses in where he is a partial owner or has a licensing or management agreement.*\n\n*\u201cAs president, Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his businesses created an environment rife with the potential for abuse.

Viral disease is diverse, as is cancer and medicine faces those challenges with diverse treatments. \n\nYou're right to point to the many past successes and potential future successes of vaccines, but you should think similarly for cancer.\n\nIt's simply a reflection of what cancer is (or any broad group of diseases) that the concept of a single cure doesn't really make sense and is extremely unlikely, however it's not necessary. Having a range of treatments to treat a range of cancers is appropriate.\n\nIncidentally, vaccines can prevent cancer.

Way too much screentime is spent on showing the serial killer\u2019s previous kills.
