{"text": "I started my fantasy career waaaaay back in college.  Graduated, started work, and our league just sort of fell apart as everyone suddenly had girlfriends, wives, and work to balance.  I guess you don\u2019t realize it, but sports seasons are calmer when you\u2019re not constantly thinking about line-ups, waivers, and tracking teams/injuries.  I probably stopped for about a decade until I was invited to participate in a work league.  The drafts were fun as we\u2019d grab a conference room at lunch (and maybe a pack of beers) and live draft all in the same room.  But I\u2019m hyper competitive and would fixate on close losses, incorrect line-ups, and stupid stuff like being one of the highest scoring teams but just having rotten luck by playing someone who got lucky and went off in a given week all while the guy with the lowest scoring team would squeak by because he also had the fewest points against.  For better or for worst, the work league sort of faded as we got promoted, people left the company, and whatever else in real life.  Fast forward and after Covid I switched jobs.  My new place had some familiar faces and they volunteered me to start up our old work fantasy league.  But after the first season, I was already burned out by the same issues I faced before.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m bad, I make playoffs more seasons than not and I\u2019m on top of making in-season moves/pick-ups.  But again, I take things too seriously and sap the fun out of it for myself.  I think there\u2019s an element of being commissioner that\u2019s extra effort as well.  Collecting buy-ins, managing payouts, ensuring that managers remain active, etc.  (I know people think if a manager stops playing, then it is what it is, but I hate when managers give up and suddenly players on bye or IR get left as starters).  Anyways, I stepped aside as commish for season 2, found a replacement for my spot, and washed my hands of the stresses of it.  I didn\u2019t make it beyond week 2 of the new season before I was checking on my co-worker (who finished in last place previously) and started offering advice.  By week 4 I was added as co-manager and completely controlling his teams player decisions.  It\u2019s honestly more relaxing and more fun not stressing about buy-ins and end of season winnings.  For me now, the joy is managing in the shadows and taking his last place team to the playoffs.  The office league Cinderella story if you will.", "label": 1}

I love reading about the statistics of the players and the buzz in camp. I love the math behind it. But after the draft the excitement just drops. There is simply no point in staying really engaged as the game is 90% luck after all. The only reason I stay tuned is simply addiction to winning/gambling. And thats fine as long as I am winning, but if your guys get injured or you just get unlucky by having the most points allowed (in my case both, you can guess) the experience is shit. \n\nI tried to watch single games, but I am not engaged with any team as I am from the EU and there're simply to many breaks to keep it exciting. Watching redzone is like watching it on speed and half of the time you're praying that a QB XYZ passes the TD to your guy and not the one of the opponent. So you're not rooting for the game, but a specific outcome. \n\nI am running the league to keep this 10 guys who partly don't see each other together. However, most season I watch the games alone as I moved and the experience is either one game(=lame) or many games(=emotional rollercoaster). \n\nThis year I really engaged as comissioner to make the experience more engaging: I thought of a small prediction game with a price, I keep the group chat alive, but in the end I feel the tiredness after 10 years of the lottery. \n\nIf anyone has a tip for making it exciting again you're welcome.", "label": 1}
