{"text": ">LMFAO! I'm just saying.

Spacw marine 2 got like a 6 and it was great and starfield got an 8.4 and it was shit just to gove two examples. A lot of people juat dont trust reviewers like IGN or Eurogamer anymore and it makes sense, the fact you 100% trust them is up to you but dont fauly everyone else for taking anything they say with a grain of s...no with a saltmine of salt.\n\n>Well I'm getting it on day 1 and will enjoy it.

Because you're like those assholes who say Game A or B has to be like this and only this or else it's not Game Series. I can think of soooooo many of those types from RPG series over the years and it's insane. Fast forward in time and the company does the rerelease.

I also didnt include the case since its moot.\n\nIf you were to seriously try to move it, AM4 is at the end of its span, the 3700x isnt a highly sought after card, the mobo isnt the newer AM4 550 series so those two can be subtracted(162 for the processor, about 70 for the mobo) which is a substantial chunk. However, they can still move, if you were to price 400-600 you probably would get someone to bite pretty quick. You can put it higher if you want, that doesnt mean itll move, eventually you will get discouraged and lower the price, or I can be wrong, I do love being wrong, but take into account AM5 is now reaching a higher performance point than AM4. If its for the right price, and they get say a 5700x3d for a good deal that may make the system more enticing to them, so put it at the high point of 600(or 800) and figure out what you are good to get talked down to, if that 800$ gets you talked down to 750, great, or 600.\n\nAlso realize, people buying second hand have no idea how the system was treated prior to them getting it, I almost always assume people screwed the machine up by OC or didnt maintain cleanliness etc, you can tell me you treated it right, but can I believe a stranger?\n\n I would probably say consider keeping your monitor unless you have higher aspirations like 48in.

So they'll only be there when the PC is switched on and so should you most of the time it's on anyway. So it's not like she's going to sneak onto it and sit there when it isn't warm. Unless she actualy just likes sitting in that area. Which would be uncommon and weird, but not impossible.\n\n  \nSetting boundries is something that people don't do enough with their pets. I keep seeing all these posts, \"my cat broke this, pulled this down\" etc etc. It's simple. We love our pets but these things are expensive. Keep the pets away from you expensive, electronic equipment. That means closing the door when you're not there and not having them willfully running around playing with things when you're not about.

Sure, obviously all standards are inherently based on premises. So what? Most humans can find shared ground on their basic premises. Most of us agree genocide is bad, so moral relativism isn't very useful. Most of us agree that a \"video game\" consisting of ten hours of a black screen and then credits would be a bad game, so at least in principle we can find shared aesthetic preferences too. That makes aesthetic relativism seem to be of questionable value too. \n\nMichelin reviews are held to be trustworthy because they are very consistent in delivering ratings according to a set of standards that align with a clear set of aesthetic preferences people find useful. You're allowed to genuinely prefer shit sandwiches served out of cockroach-infested buildings, of course, but that wouldn't really say anything except that you had deviant tastes. The same could be true for your video game tastes, too, but that wouldn't mean that video game reviewers can't be classified into trustworthy or untrustworthy (for the vast majority of not-you consumers).", "label": 1}

And shows like \"Arcane\" have really proven how you can tell a serious story with a different art style. Also - did anyone criticise Bioshock infinite for its cartoony artstyle ?\n\nGotta say, bought it on a whim yesterday because of the dissonance between the gaming crowd who seems to bandwagon the hate-train and the gaming journalists who praise this game to high heavens, which I also kind of doubt. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle and I intend to find out where this game sits with me. \n\nI'm mainly a RPG guy, so far this year I've played FF 16, FF7 Rebirth, Baldurs Gate 3 and now dragon age the veilguard. And so far I've enjoyed every single one of them, at some points more, at some points less. I've also played DA:O and DA:I and so far I feel that this game is better than DA:I. Didn't really like Origins that much though as it felt too dated when I played it after DA:I. The combat is tighter, way less MMO-ey than in DA:I. That's a big plus so far, I felt the combat was one of Inquistions weakest points, along with the very empty maps and fetch quests. Will reserve judgement for later, but atm I also don't feel the \"HR is always in the writers room\" comment from skillup. Though I play with german localisation rn which may play a role here. Though there are no real options to cause conflict in conversations so far. There's no \"fuck you\" option, basically. You can choose between nice guy, funny guy and serious guy. Haven't spotted any bad guy options yet. \n\nAnd bad facial animations ? Nah, they're on the same level as we've had this year, at least imho.

{"text": "It sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job troubleshooting your cooling situation! Given your setup, adding an exhaust fan is definitely a good move to improve airflow and reduce temperatures.\n\n1. **Number of Fans**: One exhaust fan at the rear would be a good start, but if you can fit a second one on top, it would help enhance airflow even more. Ideally, a balanced intake and exhaust setup keeps your system cool.\n2. **Fan Choice**: Both the Arctic P12 and NZXT AER P are solid options. The Arctic P12 is known for its performance and value, while the NZXT AER P also has good reviews but might be pricier. If budget is a concern and you're looking for the best performance for your investment, the Arctic P12 might be the way to go.\n3. **Placement**: If you opt for two fans, placing one at the rear and one on top can create effective airflow, drawing cooler air in from the front and pushing warmer air out.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your budget and space. If you can swing it, go for both an Arctic P12 for the rear and an additional fan on top. If not, starting with just the rear exhaust fan will already make a noticeable difference!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Yes, you can definitely try putting your RTX 4080 Super in a different PCIe slot on your Mag X670E Tomahawk WiFi motherboard. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Slot Compatibility**: Ensure the slot you\u2019re considering is compatible with your GPU. The top slot usually provides the best performance, but if it\u2019s loose, moving to a different slot can help secure it better.\n2. **Performance Impact**: While most modern GPUs perform well in PCIe x16 and x8 slots, using a different slot (like a lower bandwidth slot) may affect performance slightly, but it\u2019s typically not drastic. For gaming and most tasks, you should still see good performance.\n3. **Physical Fit**: Make sure the GPU fits properly in the new slot and is secured well. If there's still some wiggle, check if the PCIe latch is engaged properly.\n4. **Cooling and Airflow**: Also consider how the new slot might affect airflow and cooling within your case.\n\nOverall, trying a different slot is a reasonable approach, especially if it resolves the issue of it being loose. Just be cautious to avoid damaging any components when reinstalling.\n\n4o mini", "label": 1}

I do Arch-Installs pretty regularly and I can immediately tell when I forget to install nvidia-settings and change the refresh rate.\n\n>As resolution goes up, more processing power is needed to maintain high refresh rates. For instance, if you\u2019re pushing 4K resolution, a powerful GPU is required to maintain 120Hz or 144Hz smoothly, especially in graphically demanding games. So, while not required, higher refresh rates are often desirable to make the high-res experience smoother on bigger screens. \n\nWhich is exactly what I'm saying. That's why you have the higher tier cards. I run  WQHD 3440x1440@120 and most cards can barely keep up with that on modern games at good settings (mostly due to the industry spending less on optimization because of the available power in modern cards). \n\nLike Monster Hunter Wilds is claiming that a 4060 can only run the game at 1080P@60 on Medium Settings with Frame Generation enabled.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I asked AI (ChatGPT) about this ad, here is what I got:\n\nThis marketing piece is definitely packed with buzzwords and aims to impress by emphasizing the \u201cAI\u201d aspects of various motherboard features. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each section and a bit of an analysis:\n\n    AI Overclocking:\n        The concept here is about optimizing CPU performance automatically, which can be appealing to users who want better performance without manually adjusting settings. However, \u201cAI Overclocking\u201d is mostly a fancy way of saying it can learn and adapt based on system conditions. It\u2019s certainly useful, but it\u2019s not exactly groundbreaking \"AI\" as one might think\u2014it's more algorithmic tuning.\n\n    AI Cooling II:\n        This feature is essentially automated fan control, adjusting for thermal and acoustic balance. While it\u2019s convenient for people who want a quieter PC without a lot of hassle, it\u2019s another example of rebranding standard technology as \u201cAI.\u201d Most systems already have dynamic fan control, so calling it \"AI Cooling\" is a bit of a stretch.\n\n    AI Networking II:\n        This feature claims to provide seamless WiFi 7 connectivity. The \u201cAI\u201d angle here likely refers to optimizing network traffic automatically. It\u2019s useful, especially for gaming and other demanding applications, but again, the AI aspect is minimal\u2014it\u2019s more about prioritization algorithms than anything else.\n\n    ASUS AI Advisor:\n        This is essentially an interactive help system. If it uses natural language processing, it could indeed help users navigate complex motherboard settings, which is useful. But the term \u201cAI Advisor\u201d is likely overstated, as it\u2019s probably more like a sophisticated FAQ system than a true \u201cadvisor\u201d in the AI sense.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nThis ad heavily leans on the term \u201cAI\u201d to make features sound futuristic, but most of these are well-established automation and optimization technologies, simply rebranded. For tech enthusiasts or those familiar with these systems, this might come across as exaggerated or \u201cmarketing drivel.\u201d However, for less tech-savvy customers, the language might successfully convey ease of use and advanced technology, which is likely the intent.\n\n_____\n\nSeems mostly on point", "label": 1}

Make sure it\u2019s sufficient for your setup.\n2. **Overheating:** Check your temperatures. If your CPU or GPU is overheating, it could cause your system to shut down or restart. Make sure your cooling is adequate.\n3. **Monitor Settings:** If using multiple monitors, check the settings in your graphics control panel. Sometimes the configuration can cause issues when trying to use multiple displays.\n4. **Drivers:** Ensure that your graphics drivers are up to date. Sometimes, reinstalling them can help resolve weird display issues.\n5. **Windows Settings:** Look into power management settings and make sure nothing is set to turn off your displays or put your PC into sleep mode unexpectedly.\n6. **Event Viewer:** Check the Windows Event Viewer for any critical errors that occur around the time your displays go out. This can give clues as to what\u2019s happening.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I asked ChatGPT if your comment is a survivorship bias and here is the answer:  \n\n\n  \n\"Yes, that comment does reflect **survivorship bias**!\n\nPeople who complain about smurfs and AFK players in *Valorant* are focusing on the issues they encounter in the current game environment, where the anti-cheat system is very effective at minimizing cheaters. Since the anti-cheat system does its job well, cheaters are rare enough not to be a major concern, so players naturally shift their complaints to other issues like smurfs and AFK players.\n\nHowever, this perspective ignores the larger picture: without such a strong anti-cheat system, the game would likely be flooded with cheaters, and the gameplay experience would be far worse. In a sense, the absence of cheaters due to the anti-cheat system has made other, less critical issues (smurfs and AFK players) seem like the main problems. If *Valorant* didn\u2019t have such effective anti-cheat, cheating would probably overshadow all other complaints.\n\nThis is a classic example of survivorship bias: by only seeing the game as it currently is (relatively cheat-free), players may underestimate how bad things could be without those protections in place.\"", "label": 1}

Not to mention unlike the pro the PC games will allow you to use settings devs don't allow on consoles. \n\nConsoles are bad their fanboys are just tards an don't realize people who want consoles don't buy it for power an specs it's for ease of use. People who buy PCs usually want more power an bang for their buck because you are paying for the game and access to settings to tweak it so your PC is more future proof. Ps5 will not run triple A games past low or even medium settings a PC can do this an get far better results. Even PS5 was running war hammer at less than 50 fps a game that was literally optimized for a console while my laptop with a 4080 runs it at over 120. The difference is I can bump up my settings to ultra on my PC. I also have a console but I'm not some fanboy who thinks one is better than the other an bashes one I just know what they are good for an keep it at that. Plus on PC you can get games for free an use emulators which sames you more money. If I get a console it's for gaming only if I pay little more on my laptop I can game, I can watch my shows for free, I can code etc.so it's actually far cheaper than console fanboys make it out to be in terms of all uses", "label": 1}
