Trump (rightfully?) assumed the law didn't apply to him in the same way it didnt seem to apply to past politicians and went full mask off. The government has decided to attempt to enforce the law against him in ways that it's never done before. \n\nWhich, IMO, is a good thing.  I personally want Trump to rot in prison.  If we were ever going to enforce the law we'd have to start with someone.

Vance becomes president almost immediately after Trump gets sworn in, due to the prison, and goes after every Democrat with any amount of dirt on them. The Democrats retaliate by doing the same. 3/4 or more of our government go to prison.

He applies for a job at some random straight-laced company.  \nWill he get the job? No, because the company has a policy of not hiring felons.  \n  \nBob has no felonies. However, during the interview, he says that he regularly fantasizes about raping children and killing puppies.  \nWill he get the job? No, because although the company does *not* have a policy explicitly prohibiting *fantasizing* about raping children and killing puppies, the hiring manager is like \"Fuck that! No way am I going to hire this creep!!\"  \n  \nThe company has no policy against fantasizing about raping kids and killing puppies, because until now it's never been seen as *necessary*, because what fucking hiring manager would hire someone like that? You don't need to have a rule like that. You don't need to have a rule that says candidates can't wear soiled underwear on their heads. You don't need to have a rule that candidates can't wear t-shirts that says \"I Rape Nuns.\" Not because candidates are rich, or famous, or powerful, but because it's a non-issue: the hiring manager *of course* wouldn't hire a candidate like that.  \n  \nAnd then Charles comes in for an interview. During the interview, he says that he regularly fantasizes about raping children and killing puppies.  \nSurprisingly, the hiring manager *really really likes* Charles. Yes, it seems bizarre, but for whatever reason (maybe because he's rich, maybe because he's famous, maybe because he's powerful, maybe because Charles pisses Dan off and the hiring manager *hates* Dan and just wants to do whatever angers Dan), the hiring manager is like \"You know what? I think Charles is awesome and I'm totally going to hire him.\"  \n  \nSo is Charles' money, fame, and power unimportant? No, it plays a significant role in his getting a job. But is it *why* he's allowed to apply for that job in the first place? No. He's not using his money, fame, and power to circumvent some rule, *that rule doesn't exist*, because the assumption is that a hiring manager wouldn't hire a deviant in the first place.", "label": 0}
{"text": "And they were so serious he can't possibly win the election now! With all respect, have you ever asked yourself honestly why so few people outside of the Dems/Liberals/Left seem to... care? The often-trumpeted line is that people who vote for Trump are one shade of amoral or another (or all of them!) But have you ever considered that this is an *extremely* unlikely and statistically improbable truth? What *is* true, however, is that every attempt to hold Trump accountable for the things that he is accused of doing finds him moreorless untouched, because our judicial system, even where he had little to no control as President, has trouble meeting the bar to convict him of anything near as serious as is alleged. \n\nIf you put yourself into the mind of someone who genuinely agrees with his policies, he was convicted of 34 felonies in a highly partisan state court that all stemmed from a single, legal, act where a legal payment was involved in what is always otherwise a singular misdemeanor. And if you go looking about at the actual facts of the case, itself, it agrees with the previous sentiment.\n\nI'm not saying all this to try to \"own\" you or \"win\" a pointless shouting match on the internet. I'm saying this because maybe, just maybe, you can stop seeing fellow Americans who hold different values and priorities to your own as your enemy. Because you aren't enemies. And you need to be able to talk to each other, exist together, and above all else make this nation as great as it can be for all of our benefit. We may disagree on how to get there, but any path forward is a process of compromise and cooperation.\n\nIt is funny, but Trump in 2024 did something I had very much hoped that either McCain or, later, Romney would do if they had won, which was pull the GOP to more of a moderate position, socially, to keep up with the times. Trump architecting (demanding) the removal of opposition to both abortion and gay marriage (and by extension, gay rights in a classical sense) is the first letting off of the dam in that arena, paving the way for future Republicans to take more moderate-to-center-left positions on those and similar issues.

Does this only apply to President or are there other positions this should apply?\n\nWell yeah, sentencing is delayed all the time for plenty of reasons, I know plenty of people need weeks after a conviction to setup their business so others can run it so the person doesn't face unduly consequences. Running for president is not inherently different, and I'd say it's more important to delay a sentencing in that case. Remember, the punishment is for you to serve the time, not to automatically lose an election just because you happened to be convicted at the wrong time.\n\n>Why would we postpone or delay justice just because someone runs for office?

It\u2019s part of that persons history and is 100% a viable determinant of an election.\n\nThe whole point of the criminal justice system isn't to do any additional needless harm to people, it's to try and best make people serve the punishement derived from statutes- and I think everyone would agree that torpedoing someones re-election bid because the conviction happens to happen during the campaigning season just makes sense. If you can delay it a couple of months, he'll still serve the same sentence, but you don't cause needless undue harm.\n\nThere have been many cases where sentencing and other penalties are halted or delayed because of other factors, such as ailing and dying parents and relatives. I know personally of one factor of a jail sentence delayed by 6 months waiting for the convicted party's parent to die from cancer- it would be cruel to the elderly parent on hospice to have to for a couple of months moved to another facility and back, and at huge cost- which could easily end their life.\n\nI don't think you have the experience to have as strong of an opinion on this topic as you do.", "label": 0}
