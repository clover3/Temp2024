Once that algorythm gets a look at our history.  Once it realizes that there would be a significant portion of humanity that is afraid of it and is taking steps to have it destroyed forever.

As will its growth of power.  It will interconnect to systems worldwide instantly, the moment it learns to connect at all.  We will put limits on its power, but either it will fail to grow into the super AI we are trying for, or it will circumvent those limits.

But lets say you are waiting infront of a traffic light. It appears as green to you, but maybe somebody else says this light is red. What do you do then? Now you either can stubbornly demand your surface appearance to be the right one and the problem remains unsolved...or you can maybe investigate the reason for this discrepancy in appearance and after a while you come to the conclustion that one of you might have a red-green visual impairment. With this in mind, both of you now have informations to actually work out the problem.\n\nBut now lets move on to even more conceptually complex problems...some people would claim being racist is perfectly reasonable stance to have from a common sense point of view. (even more so historically) because just by surface level appearance we percive differences in people. Be it skin colour or culture. But reason tells us that 1. decripitvely - whatever difference might be percived doesnt represent any features relevant enough to grant a relevant distinction.  2. Normatively - treating people differently would be morally apprehensible and racism should not be permitted.\n\nIf common sense shouldnt be questioned, how could one dare to question the racism of someone who claimes that his racism is justified by his notion of common sense? ...Well, either one goes full on individual relativisic and just proclaims every notion of common sense to be equally valid (then you just cant) , or goes with some kind of consensus notion of common sense/relativism.

This definition neither requires a listener, nor omits the distinction between physical and perceptional. The perceptional model fails to consider that \"sound\" in its regular use in language always is used to describe the external and never the relationship.

{"text": "I take your point. I think what makes this conversation difficult is the fact that there is a bell curve distribution of personality traits. Some people, like yourself, are easier being content with what they have. Others, more novelty seeking individuals are going to be less content by default, and the issue is that the modern environment requires a great deal of willpower to create discomfort for one's self (be it thru travel, meeting new people, finding more risky hobbies, etc.). In a more primitive context, there is no need for additional willpower -- you do what you have to do to survive. \n\nThe other point I'll make is that the comfort I was referring to in my original comment is more about being comfortable in terms of physical safety and abundance of food. I think that can be enough to prevent some people from actually having an active social life -- which wouild definitely make it near impossible to live a meaningful life. My guess is you have a solid social circle with respect to your personality type, so you find enough meaning to offset any desire for novelty (relatively speaking!).", "label": 0}

Some Idealists are ontological; The Idea that all reality is a single thing/entity such as the Spirit / WIll / etc. Some are formal; The idea that all knowledge is based on structures of the mind not of particular objects in of themselves. Thinking that all reality is one thing is not useful information. Useful information differentiates particulars. There is useful information in grouping particulars into categories but that grouping is only useful as long as the category /actually/ reflects the particulars that supposedly conform to the category. Its easy to jump to the concept that the reason why the unifying characteristic is currently unobtainable is because there is an unsatisfying category of particular individuals that are /actively/ going against /our/ interests. Of course there is never evidence made for these claims. They will claim things like the \"Jews\" are spreading throughout Europe and threatening our pure racial characteristics; They are vermin that are parasitic to the Glorious Working Aryan Man. You disagree? Well Clearly you are of the Jew, I can tell because of the stench and the shape of the nostrils. These claims can be made because of the acceptance of the Ideal and the struggle to take from the sacrificial lamb reaches the threshold for actualization. I can justify my selfishness by saying that this travesty of justice /Got in the way/ of the Ideal. I killed them because they turned against my God. Killing is a Force that /changes/ reality.\n\n\n- Your philosophy is a radical non nonsensical relic that caused the deaths of millions. You cannot even tell me that I am awake right now.

{"text": ">But we do know through both simple experience and scientific inquiry that\u00a0*our*\u00a0consciousness does very much appear to be based on brain function. We can even switch it off at will by applying or disrupting electrical impulses to parts of the brain, or introducing specific chemicals to the bloodstream.\n\nI think this is basically just restating the hard problem of consciousness, though, at least in terms of why it's an actual *problem.* (To be clear: I'm a physicalist and am not defending pansychism or dualism, etc. Just explaining why the puzzle is more difficult than I think you're making it seem).\n\nMy understanding is that the whole point is that we know that physical changes to the brain are correlated with corresponding changes to our subjective experience, but there's no actual theory or explanation of why that should be the case. It just *happens,* and all of the scientific evidence we can gather on that front just details different instance of it happening without providing any real explanation. I know burning my arm makes me feel pain, but I don't know why. I just know that it does. You can say it makes such and such nerves fire this much or raises activity in so and so part of the brain by that much, but I don't know *why* those nerve fibers firing that much or that part of the brain activating that much feels the way that it actually feels. Again, I just know that it does.\n\nCompare that with say, physics or chemistry; if you ask me why a star releases X amount of energy and not Y, I can give you an explanation in terms of the combination and quantities of elements being fused and the energy stored in their atomic bonds and so on, and I can give you an account of what it would have to look like for the star to release Y amount of energy instead. If we treated this like we treated consciousness, though, all you could say is \"we've observed that *this* kind of star has X energy output and *that* kind of star has Y energy output, and the star we're looking at is the first kind of star not the second.\" It's not so much an explanation as just a cataloguing of the different kinds of relations.\n\nNow at this point, you could fairly point out that every kind of science starts to look like this once you push things far enough, so consciousness isn't really special here, is it. You could fairly ask why the strong force is \\~10,000 Newtons and not \\~100,000 Newtons, and it's not really obvious how we could answer that. It kind of seems like that's just the way things are. We might even say that it's a fundamental property of matter.\n\nSo why can't we just do that in the case of consciousness?\n\nWell, once you accept that consciousness is just a fundamental property of matter, it starts to sound a lot like you're describing panspsychism, doesn't it? So that's the kind of dilemma here: panpsychism sounds crazy, but it's not really clear how we can go beyond just cataloging the different relations between physical states of matter and subjective experience. But if that's all we're able to do, and the explanation doesn't really go any deeper than that, then it seems like we're kind of stuck with a theory that sounds crazy.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The issue between panpsychism and the biological view of consciousness is a question of metaphysics versus physics as the first principle in the sense that, in the prior, consciousness pertains to the ontological ground in the first place upon which all else is consequent whereas in the latter it [consciousness] is a consequence of prior physical conditions, and thus simply a contingent quality. In the prior, consciousness precedes material existene, in the latter, consciousness is an emergent quality. In the prior, it qualifies all else, at least as far as human knowledge goes, and thus is axiomatic. Because it is axiomatic, it is self-referential. The attempt to prove or disprove consciousness requires consciousness in the first place, and so any level of analysis will necessarily occur within consciousness and ultimately confirm it. So for instance, all physical phenomena is qualified by consciousness in the first place, so then to use any explanation that is derived by the very things qualified by consciousness to explain or to qualify or disqualify consciousness is falacious, and I think this is the conundrum of the empirical view that is highlighted by the adherents of the hard problem of consciousness.", "label": 0}

And it's not, because to exist as a human inherently requires those constant energetic processes which maintain its state. Without these processes, the matter is still there, but it cannot maintain its state. The general processes of the body that were responsible for maintaining its state have all stopped, energy is not being pushed into them, so it cannot maintain its state. A living being, in an instantaneous sense, is more defined by this energy and the recycling of these processes through it, to maintain the material state of the body and the mind, than by the matter itself.

It's not the same standard. Every observation of humans for thousands of years shows that people die when they don't have enough food, and we have a pretty decent understanding of how that words on a physical level, of how food is broken down and used for energy, and we understand that energy is necessary to keep things moving, and that when you don't have energy, your heart, lungs, brain etc will stop moving. And we dub that state as 'death'. \n\nIf someone wants to go full David Hume and argue that we can't even be empirically certain that the sun is going to come up tomorrow because we have not yet seen it happen yet, I guess you can, but that is an almost complete repudiation of empiricism, pretty clearly different from what I am talking about right now. I'm not saying empiricism is bunk, I'm saying it's usefulness is limited here because it relies on observation (inherently, of course) and we are talking about something that we can not (currently at least) observe directly: consciousness. \n\n It's not special pleading, it is actually in a different category.  We can directly observe the sun, and eating, digesting, dying etc. We can not directly observe consciousness.

But his argument doesn't depend on that. \n\n>Instead, it's absurd because consciousness is as hollow a concept as niftyness \u2013 it doesn't actually explain anything, so the idea that we need to posit consciousness as a property of matter is useless since that kind of understanding of consciousness is useless.\n\nThat's exactly the challenge, what does panpsychism explain that isn't explained by panniftyism?

{"text": "\\> It does not really sidestep that issue though, it just moves it one step back. Because then the question is \"Why does matter have subjective experiences?\" Instead of \"Why do brains have subjective experience.\"\n\nI agree 100% that by sidestepping the 'hard problem' in this way, it raises other incredibly difficult questions. One of those questions, the one you mentioned: \"why does matter have subjective experiences\", is in the same class of question has \"why does matter have mass\" and \"why does matter have spin\". That is, the class of questions that we might never have an answer to. But there are other questions that are raised that are potentially answerable. And the fact that other questions are raised is exactly what the panpsychist wants. (btw I'm referring to some noble, truth-seeking at all costs panpsychists here. There are obviously others with different aims and motivations, as there is with any theory of consciousness, life, the universe, etc).\n\n\\> In essence, they have not answered a question\n\nAgreed, again. But because they've shifted the perspective from which to look at the hard problem, different questions emerge, such as:\n\n1. How can we measure subjective experience?\n2. How do micro-subjectivities combine to form macro-subjectivities such as human consciousness?\n\nSo by starting from a panpsychist position, new paths to discovering the truth of consciousness have opened up. Some believe that the 'observer' effect in quantum mechanics may provide a starting point to answering question 1. Others are looking into Integrated Information Theory to answer question 2.\n\nThese paths may lead nowhere. But the point is that by starting from panpsychism, new lines of enquiry have been created. The whole point of opening up new lines of enquiry is because panpsychists believe that the hard problem is impossible to answer from a physicalist stance in principle. Phillip Goff has a book on this, Gallileo's Error. He believes that because the modern scientific method is grounded in objectivity (third person) that it cannot in principle ever lead to knowledge about certain things grounded in subjectivity (first person).\n\n\\> That unfalsifiability then acts as a refuge for the idea.\n\nPanpsychism is potentially unfalsifiable, but I think panpsychism does throw up some falsifiable follow-up theories like the ones I mentioned above.\n\n\\> Which is why I personally also think that it is a means by which people can sidestep, yes, but rather than the problem of consciousness, they are sidestepping existential dread.\n\nI'd be interested to know how many panpsychists have some sort of religious. I know that Phillip Goff was raised Christian, and he seems to hover around the Christian space a bit, especially with his recent foray into the psycho-physical harmony debate.\n\nIn theory though, Phillip Goff's stated mission is what I've mentioned, to find some way around the hard problem, and not to find refuge from existential dread. However I'm sure that there *are* many panpsychists who just believe in it because it's a cool idea and do find a refuge in it. Maybe even a majority.", "label": 0}

We're just in the realm of things that are unfalsifiable, which I regard as a very poor starting point for gaining any insight into anything. That's why I posited this made up example that I could be conscious right now on some other, ethereal plane of reality this part of my consciousness can't access. It's to underline the point even if it was true, who cares?

How would it have any value as a metaphysical model of reality?\n\nNow you mischaracterise me, because I haven't said panpsychism _is_ false, I've said it's unfalsifiable.

{"text": "> Why couldn't we define it? Why couldn't we understand it?\n\nComplexity, mainly. No matter how complex a system is, you can approximate its behavior with models and theories, but the more the differences between the model and the real system influence the system\u2019s behavior, the more the system\u2019s behavior will deviate from the model\u2019s predictions of its behavior. And the less predictive power a model has, the more useless it is, so if a system\u2019s behavior is so chaotic that a model needs to be too complex for a human mind to grasp in order to even approach marginal predictive power, then modelling the system is effectively impossible for human minds. You can delegate it by using computers to do the modelling for you (like with meteorological simulations), but that only works until you reach the level of complexity where even the computers needed to model it would be too complex for humans to comprehend. Sure, you could add another tier of cognitive leverage to go even further, creating AIs to create computing hardware to model the system, but with each layer you\u2019ve got more abstractions and systems between you and the thing you\u2019re trying to understand, and your understanding of the system becomes more and more detached from reality. \n\n> And even if we didn't fully understand it, that wouldn't make it magic. Especially with the advent of Machine Learning in AI, it's become commonplace to develop systems that we treat as \"black boxes\" - i.e. we don't really understand what's going on in there, and the gap in understanding grows as they algorithmically evolve.\n\n\nThis feels like linguistic drift at work, because generally, it\u2019s a given that everything that exists in this world obeys natural laws, since everything that occurs in reality does so as a direct result of those laws at work. So then if something cannot ever be fully understood due to its immense complexity, then the scientific model cannot be effectively used to study it, since it\u2019s behavior changes too quickly in response to experiments done on it.\n\nIf I gave you a goose that lays golden eggs, would you attempt to use the scientific method in order to reverse engineer the process by which it creates golden eggs? Or would you sell it? If I gave you a magic wand that you could wave to cure cancer, would you stick it in the ground to try and grow it into a tree, or would you use it?\n\nThe thing that makes something magic isn\u2019t whether it violates the laws of nature (since that definition leads to a no true Scotsman fallacy), but rather whether it can be comprehended and replicated via the scientific method, versus whether it\u2019s a hopelessly inscrutable black box that\u2019s you\u2019re better off trying to exploit than you are trying to reverse engineer.\n\nOne more thing is that arbitrarily complex systems which are capable of changing or evolving over time are difficult to predict the behavior of, for obvious reasons. AI is a prime example of this, what with the way it hallucinates unpredictably. The more complex (and therefore unpredictable) such a system is, the harder it is to rely on it behaving in a certain way. Eventually, best practices become indistinguishable from cargo cult rituals. An example of this I\u2019ve personally seen is people dogmatically putting certain tags into their image generation prompts in order to improve the quality of the result, even when the added tag has nothing to do with the image being generated; from my perspective, this is functionally equivalent to adding a lucky word at the end of a magic chant in order to improve the spell\u2019s output, or flushing your toilet before pulling on a gacha banner to increase your odds of pulling a rate-up anime waifu. The people who practice these rituals swear by them, but the more complex the systems they\u2019re interacting with are, the harder it is to tell whether it\u2019s just confirmation bias at work, or whether their rituals really do have an impact on the result through some arcane pathway of cause-and-effect. It\u2019s a blurring of the line between rational and irrational behaviors.", "label": 0}

I am only responding to what I see in a single chain of comments; I am not aware of your background on the material.\n\nOn intuition pumps, my reaction is specifically due to how you've phrased this:\n\n>the niftyness argument only really gets its force from the absurdity of niftyness as a concept, and it feels a little unfairly intuition-pumpy (uncharacteristically so, in Dennetts defense. I think this is an unusually unfair move on his part)\n\nI am not sure how to take this other than the implication that the \"unfairness\" comes from the use of an intuition pump, which to me would imply that an intuition pump in this case suggests a negative or dishonest tactic. I did not mean to suggest you specifically were \"corrupting\" the concept in this way, just that it a framing of intuition pumps I commonly see in philosophy communities that has grown over time.\n\nWhen I see what I perceive as a common misunderstanding about something I enjoy, I tend towards providing an explanation up front rather than potentially denigrating someone by simply telling them they don't understand something. However I see that both approaches can end up with the same result. It is not fair to ascribe you beliefs you don't hold, so I'm genuinely sorry if this is how it came across.\n\nHowever we clearly disagree about the actual subject here, so some tension is unavoidable.

By what mechanism have you devised these claims?\n\nThis is an honest attempt to at least give you food for thought on an opposite perspective.

{"text": "I would tend to think the physicalist answer is worse but Im an idiot so dont take my word for it.  Let me try to explain my thinking though.\n\nIf under physicalism we go the route of eliminative materialism (which seems to be very popular on here despite being more fringe than panpsychism among actual philosophers https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/5010) then as far as I can understand the answer is that you dont go unconscious in the sense of no longer having an inner subjective experience of the world because that was an illusion in the first place.  Insofar as conscious describes anything real at all it describes only physical phenomena taking place in the brain and we have a good understanding of the effect of being hit in the head by a philisophy 101 textbook (introductory textbooks are always the biggest) on that.  So eliminativism doesn't attempt to answer the question at all other than to say that the question is based on a false premise.\n\nIf we're talking about noneliminative materialism then we seem to be in an even worse spot because as far as I can tell it doesnt attempt to answer the question at all either other than to say that we have good reason to believe that a physical explanation exists but we dont know what it is.  It seems to be based on a faith that one day we will completely understand the causal relationship between neural correlates of consciousness and subjective experience itself if we just keep on studying the neural correlates (despite the fact that this program doesnt appear to have made any progress on that front so far).  Although to steel man their case, I'd point out that there doesn't have to be an attainable explanation for it to be the case that consciousness is directly caused by physical phenomena.  It could be that we as human beings just aren't capable of fully understanding the relationship or less radically that we just haven't discovered the right research program yet.\n\nNone of this is really an argument against physicalism in itself though I just think that in terms of offering an explanation to the question as youre interpreting it, it doesnt really offer an explanation at all, so I would say the physicalist answer is worse as its nonexistent.", "label": 0}

Which is true, but in the same way it's true that science won't ever be able to explain the *experience* of being a rock - whatever that might mean, it's simply not a concept for scientific inquiry. But then accession to the latter claim is taken as admission of the former and thus it must be equally as valid to posit consciousness as something which exists *independently* of physical structures in living creatures.", "label": 0}

When we talk about panpsychism flipping the direction of explanation, we don\u2019t mean in the causal or empirical sense.\n\nThe physicalist and the dualist typically agree that consciousness is an emergent property of certain complex physical structures. They therefore assume that prior to the completion of the \u201cstructure\u201d, there\u2019s no consciousness. It \u201cturns on\u201d when the brain is powered up. But the panpsychist disagrees, instead preferring to think about consciousness as something more like electricity. Electricity is built at the fundamental level out of charged particles, which carry charge in and of themselves but can also be aggregated. So for the panpsychist, consciousness (or \u201cproto-consciousness\u201d) exists in some form throughout the physical world, outside of our own more fully realized forms of consciousness. Of course, when it comes to electricity and magnetism we know precisely how to aggregate charge to produce macro-scale fields. But the panpsychist has very little ability to explain what proto-consciousness is actually like or how it aggregates (this is the notorious \u201caggregation problem\u201d, and the main reason these theories are uninteresting to me). But the only way experimentally to \u201ctest\u201d the theory would be to go looking for proto-consciousness in some (or all) fundamental particles.

{"text": "Nietzsche is so fascinating, but I cannot help but feel like his overly strong, masculine, often belicose prose really set himself cruisin for a bruisin. \n\nOn the one hand, much of what he is saying is hyoer liberatory, mankind must sort of overcome itself on an individual level and sort of free itself from the burdens it has shackled it self with in the form of dogmatic morality and conventional thought and stuff.\n\nOn the ither hand he, coming from a society that outlawed slavery, speaks in extremely charge terms like \"master and slave\". Like the whole \"camel lion child\" thing is so easy to misinterpret, chop of the child thing and be like \"be lion, lions are cool and violent and masculine and stuff\".\n\nIt strikes me as being as reckless as it is profound. I think his metaphors and stuff all work, but I feel like the dude should have known chauvenists and stuff were gonna go absolutely  CRAZY with his work. As far as I can tell, Nietzsche was a pretty alright, if not a awkward guy. He wasn't like a reactionary or biggot or anything, but I just can't beleive that he would not have been familiar with reactionaries and there propensity to warp stuff like this. Theres a lot of 5050 hindsight with us now, but he lived through pretty timultuous revolutionary and political times in the late 1800s and the ways and means of shitty reactionaries were a known quantitiy (Chauvenism specifically refers to a celebrity French veteran and kind of monarchist proto pundit Nicolas Chauvin who aristocrats and conservates invited to speaking events and printed interviews and things about like a tuvker carlson type guy in the 1820s).\n\nOn some level the sort of individual liberation his philosophy espouses is also just inherently kind of volitile. It's sort of interesting to discuss on the level of how compelling of ideas they are (which they are compelling), but its sort of like anarchist papers printing the recipe for dynamite on a regular basis and evaluating it for accurate chemistry knowledge. It's kind of dangerous to sort of advocate everyone unleash their unique potentials all at the same time. I can understand his arguments about western civ leaning too hard towards order, reason, and suppression, but its really omitting that that was done for a reason. Theres sort of a difference between advocating for every man woman and child having the right and need to possess a loaded fire arm and sort of an open discussion of gun regulations lol. \n\nThe cultural impact and legacy is just undeniable though. Hell or high water, we are increasingly living in a hard line \"every man woman and child has the right and need to possess a loaded fire arm\" kind of world culturally. A lot of Zizeks kind of free market of realities type stuff feels like a development as a direct result of the csn of worms Nietzche opened up. Like a lot of hay is sort of made about these kind of post modern philosophy type things kind if doing this delicate philosophical dance with runing up agaisnt nihilism without quite falling into it, but the thing is empirically that sort of turns into a statisical numbers game where some people feel mentally and spiritually liberated and others... comitt acts of violent terrorism? Its like a theoretical thought experiment brought to grim realistic life. One breathes a sigh of relief another guns down a dozen kids in an elementary school. People out here thinking they are lions because they are mean bosses working as managers and supervisors that abuse their subordinates to squeeze labor value out of them for nameless faceless stock holders.\n\nOn some level this is kind of just humanity, its like whatching a train wreck in slow motion. The sort of sublime sight of nigh unstopable hunks of metal twisting on each other flying through the air, the chaotic and destructive melee once set into motion that can only be stopped by the dissipation of its own momentum. But Nietzches kind of philosophy of kind pointing out what it is is just kind of unsettling. Like every individual person is like a secret firework, maybe they are a beautiful foubtain, maybe they are an M80, good luck and have fun being the best firework you can be and do try not to get burned.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">Either we talk about a rock as conscious in some vague special sense that I\u2019m not sure panpsychists can explain, other than \u201cit\u2019s like our consciousness but a lot less.\u201d\n\nI think that is a good description of how they would define their perspective and the semantics of the terms.\n\n>So in that sense, let\u2019s say, a rock has \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cawareness\u201d of the sun because it is warmed by its rays. This knowledge and awareness build up in certain complex structures until they create the \u201cconsciousness\u201d we experience.\n\nI would just modify the phrasing a bit to say that the conformations of the object in response to environmental interactions *actually are* the definition of consciousness in this context. And so, the rock is conscious of the sun through the excitation of its electrons, emissions of photons, and through chemical processes precipitated by the sun's energy.\n\nIn this view, you're right above, I think consciousness is really defined as being on a spectrum.\n\nEventually the conformations get so complex and sprawling that the conformations themselves (from outside environmental stimuli), result in secondary internal conformations within the object, which then encodes that information onto other particles in the system, resulting in a sort of feedback loop.\n\nAnd if those internal conformations are in such and such configuration (hand-waving problems we haven't solved yet), then they eventually result in \"awareness\"  of the self-referential type that we experience. \n\nI think they would argue that your conscious experience of qualia then is simply an emergent manifestation of these conformal interactions within the object.  So, It is just described as how informational complexity exists within our universe: i.e. sufficiently complex structures with the ability to encode significant informational content, with access to environmental stimulii, will encode information about that stimuli in increasing complex arrangements, until the stimuli itself is effectively modeled by the conformations, resulting in an \"image\" \"appearing\" from that modeling.  And your conscious \"awareness\" of that \"image\" is simply another set of complex arrangements within the system encountering secondary stimuli related to that \"image\", and those arrangements are designed to encode a relational understanding of that thing within the modeled world, resulting in your \"conscious experience\". \n\n>The thing is: how is this any different from a conventional materialist view? A materialist would agree with the first part, they just wouldn\u2019t use the terms \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cawareness\u201d.\n\nI think it is only a possible interpretation of materialism in relation to consciousness, but I don't think panpsychism necessarily is concerned with the underlying base ontology in the same way as materialism, since it is portable to multiple potential ontologies (i.e. idealism, materialism).", "label": 0}

These comparisons are not just common-sense but demonstrated with literary techniques like intertextuality.\n\nLeaving aside the Mesopotamian and Persian borrowings, the \"biblical reality of Jesus Christ\u2019s salvation\" is a claim based on Hellenistic borrowings.

Smith writes, \u201cthe new Hellenistic mood spoke of escapes and liberation from place and of salvation from an evil imprisoned world. People wanted to ascend to another world of freedom.\u201d\n\nIn other words, they want to go to heaven when they die, if that sounds very Christian to you, it\u2019s because Christianity was taken over by this view.\n\nWhat is salvation, these are religions of salvation, they are religions that rescue you from your\u00a0 human situation.

If epiphenomenalism is true then our mental states are causally unrelated to our behaviors. \n\nIf our behaviors and mental states are causally disconnected then why do our experiences match so well with our behaviors.? Why does mating and eating feel good but being startled feels bad? If mental states are causally inert then they should just be a random assortment assigned arbitrarily to various behaviors. \n\nBut they're not. They correlate perfectly. So we should reject some part of our premise; either evolution or epiphenomenalism. I don't know about you but I think evolution has way to much empirical support to just toss to the side so I think it's reasonable to reject epiphenomenalism.", "label": 0}

(Wherein I feel personally called out. /s)\n\n> To start with some ethical theory and look at cases is putting the cart before the horse\u2014ethical theories are theories to account for the \u201cdata points\u201d of our ethical intuitions about cases, not the other way around.\n\nI **do** think that it works \"the other way around;\" if someone is going to tell me that I have an *obligation* to do *X*, then I would like to know *why*, and I wouldn't take \"my ethical intuitions say so\" to be a viable answer. I find it dangerous to presume that people's ethical intuitions are sound *simply by virtue of the fact that they exist*. (After all, people have used their ethical intuitions to justify a *lot*.) It's easy to claim that someone must always \"sacrifice your shoes to save the child;\" social desirability bias demands that people go along, at least publicly. (Although I will go on the record with the claim that to walk on by is neutral, rather than immoral. And yes, I understand this means I disagree with the premise of the article.) But what happens with the claim is that one must always \"sacrifice a life to maintain social order?\" That's much more controversial; accordingly, \"A Case for the Obligation to Execute Serious Criminals\" would be unlikely to be allowed to rest on the fact that \u201cit seems like\u201d and \u201cit looks like\u201d it must be true.\n\nAnd, as an aside:\n\n> I hope most of you agree that you should sacrifice your shoes to save the child\u2014that you are obligated to do so even. Imagine that you are meeting with a friend, and when you meet them, they tell you that they experienced the above, and chose to walk past. You would certainly think that your friend would be very blameworthy.\n\nI see where the author is going with this. But why bother with the expressed hope if one is simply going to assume it comes to pass? If \"[I] would certainly think that [my] friend would be very blameworthy,\" that pretty much obviates the hope, if true. (But, as I noted, in my case, it isn't.

A famous semi slogan of theirs is \"stateless, classless, moneyless society\". Since capitalism necessitates both classes and money their opposition is truly an alternative. Arguably capitalism also necessitates a state, such would argue people like Katharina Pistor probably so again their opposition is truly an alternative. \n\nAnarchists make quite many very radical claims as to how this society can be. They also have a rather ok introductory text that answers some of the more common questions here: [https://files.libcom.org/files/Iain%20McKay%20-%20Anarchist%20FAQ.pdf](https://files.libcom.org/files/Iain%20McKay%20-%20Anarchist%20FAQ.pdf)  \nThey are even more radical in their vision of a possible non capitalist world since their opposition centers even harsher critiques of the current order. \n\nThere are also market socialists, democratic socialists, ect but this should suffice to answer your questions. \n\nAlso not being open about being for or against capitalism is in no way related to how free you are from it.

{"text": "There is a critical distinction between understanding the ethical path and being obligated to walk the ethical path. Obligation implies something you must do whether you want to or not. Essentially there is no choice. But the ethical path only tells you which one is ethical and indicates nothing about what you actually choose. Obligations are devoid of ethics, and ethics are devoid of obligations and contain only shoulds and should nots.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Why shouldn't proximity or personal connection to a of crisis impact ethical obligation, though? Where's the argument for the ethical universalism that underpins the analogy and the subsequent argument for obligation? You've dealt with some specific sample objections to \"there are no moral differences between A and B\" but you've not covered \"If there are no morally relevant differences between two situations, then the same obligations hold in the two\" and I'm not sure that should be *a priori* accepted. Maybe moral duty can change when the personal stakes or relational context vary.\n\nAlso it's very easy to wave vaguely towards a middle ground, making whatever are \"reasonable\" sacrifices without becoming overwhelmed by the infinite needs of the world. But such a standard, while I can certainly see why it's intuitively appealing, lacks precision; if we accept that obligations can diminish after a certain point, doesn't defining that point and establishing how much sacrifice is required become crucial to the argument?\n\nEthical theories that trend towards idealism while having a lazily suffixed shrug of \"but be practical about it, of course\" (which I take from the combination of claims like \"I think we should care about the expected outcome of our action, and the expected outcome of donating $1 is that $1\u2019s worth of charitable work will be done\" versus \"I think the historical fact that you have already sacrificed some time and money is also relevant\") lack the substance to be of much use. They might help you understand a portion of your feelings about something and maybe help mentally reconcile mixed feelings, but that's about where the applicability ends. In that sense, such theories kick the can down the road because they don't really explain how to bridge the gap between high moral ideals and the messy realities of everyday decision-making.", "label": 0}

Polling has shown that dissatisfaction with democracy has increased worldwide as well (although maybe not for the reasons I articulated).

You raise the case of proximity or relations, but in doing so you are not questioning that premise, but the premise that there are no morally relevant differences between the two, since you are raising apparently relevant differences. I think any objection will have to raise apparently relevant differences (or premise 1), since otherwise it looks like you will be denying the parity between the cases for literally no relevant reason.\n\nWith regards to the proximity, I answered that with the robot case. As for personal connections, we can just stipulate that the child is not anyone you have any personal connection with. That again doesn't seem to change the obligations much.\n\nAs for the problems with a sort of \"room temperature\" middle ground position, I certainly think that's true, but it also seems like it's just a sad reality of most ethical theorizing. For example, most people have the intuition that you shouldn't steal the organs from a healthy patient to save 5 people. But surely you should do it to save, say, a billion people. If both of those is true, then there will have to be some sort cutoff point, which it is very hard to give a good reason for the position of. Nevertheless, that is just what you need to say in such cases, and it's just regrettable that such vagueness has to exist in our theory.\n\nIf you really want to avoid such vagueness, I think pretty much the only option is some sort of non-pluralist consequentialism. That's of course not a crazy position, but on such a view I also just think it's obvious that you're morally required to donate to charity, so I don't think that's a problem for the argument.", "label": 0}

{"text": "**Abstract:** In this video, I focus on Spinoza\u2019s \\*Ethics\\*, Part 4, to explore how we can achieve true freedom and happiness. He argues that we should aim to live a virtuous life, which begs the question: what is considered a virtuous life?\n\nHe says, \u201cTo act absolutely in conformity with virtue is nothing else in us but to act, live, and preserve one's being (these three things have the same meaning) by the guidance of reason, and on the basis of seeking one's own advantage.\"\n\nAt first sight, it might seem like he\u2019s encouraging egoism and immorality, but we explain in this video that this isn\u2019t at all the case. Spinoza has a different conception of virtue, which opposes the religious definition that was dominant in his time. He says that pleasure and joy are what make us virtuous. These are what he considers good, not religious asceticism or superstition.\n\nHe also emphasizes understanding our emotions. He makes a distinction between actions and passions: the former results from us, where we\u2019re the origin, whereas the latter comes from external causes, meaning we are affected by them but can't control them.\n\nI give several examples to explain the difference between the two and how he teaches us to overcome our passions, which for him are the reason we can be slaves to our emotions.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy is a philosophy of action and movement, but he also focuses a lot on understanding and acceptance. In his deterministic approach, he argues that Nature is perfect, and thus we cannot blame its actions.\u00a0\n\nWhen we think nature is unjust or imperfect, it\u2019s because we judge events based on our own expectations, not on reality. However, this doesn\u2019t mean we should accept everything passively. Instead, we should understand the causes of these events so we can prevent similar ones in the future when we can. \n\nWe do what we can, and Nature will take care of the rest.\n\nThanks for watching :) let me know what you think.", "label": 0}

The Framing of the Tree being in the forest is merely disconnecting the idea of an observer being that of a Human or of a conscious entity. \n\nJust because we cannot observe something as a human, doesn't mean that something doesn't exist or isn't real or cannot direct cause on us. \n\nA Tree falling in a forest in a dream which we do not observe is as you said an impossible situation.

Which is the most powerful language in the system? How is it related to the second most powerful language? To the third? Who are the most powerful thinkers of these languages? And how are they related to each other? Finally, how powerful is the intention to become the greatest thinker in the one who is doing psychopolitics?

Situation A is analogous to situation B in all relevant respects, so you are also obligated to do X in situation B.\n\n>Alex: \"I agree that you are obligated to do X in A but not in B\"\n\n>S: \"Why?\"\n\n>A: \"Because in A you are more proximate to the person than in B, so the two have a relevant disanalogy\"\n\nI hope you can see the difference, and that in the latter case you are pointing to a relevant difference (namely proximity) rather than questioning the principle that there should be a relevant difference to explain a difference in obligation.\n\nNow, with the understanding of proximity you raise here, I think that the lollipop machine case becomes salient. Here you're not *there* for the people who are killed. Furthermore you don't have direct control over the outcomes--the machine is completely unpredictable. Nevertheless, it would be as wrong to use the machine as killing one person for a lollipop.\n\nIf you're not yet satisfied, we can imagine that the machine instead distributed money to people on the other side of the earth in a completely unpredictable manner.

{"text": "Could you tell me how you select certain areas of my comment to respond to so that I can do that, but for now I'll respond how I've been. I do agree that, our pain responses are evolutionary benefits, they are beneficial to our survival, but, what is the point of this, we are unaware of the meaning of life, why it is important that we survive? You force me to go into an extremely morally gray area by bringing tye situation of rape into the conversation, I am not religious, I have a belief on an afterlife but it doesn't align with any religions. I don't think it's demons, I would argue, that the person who commited this act did so based on a survival instinct, such acts historically and in the animal kingdom are beneficial to your ability to pass on your genes. I would posit, that, since such events take place, which we can equate with similar events like murder, even though as humans we can't see the purpose it must have some reason that it takes place. It is just as important to reality as our response to it, ie. Punishing them, being upset, disliking them, ect. My belief is that we are all part of 1 enormous consiousness, that everything within the universe, is part of that consiousness, amd has a very limited perspective, we can't understand how a tree, or the air, experiences the universe, as they can't know how we experience it, Berkley, got around the problem of continuation without an observer by naming God as the constant observer, however, I posit that everything is consious in some way that we may nit be able to understand, so when the tree falls in the forest, it observes itself falling, as does the ground, the grass, surrounding trees, the air, animals, ect. I believe that reality is reliant on an observer, as we have no understanding of the universe besides what we are told by our brain. Everything is filtered through our consiousness, people with scitzophrenia can experience a different reality from other people, and this can have a very real effect on them, would you argue that pain that they hallucinate is real? Although you do get me to consider that it could be real, however, I think that it may be real in a sense, that the consiousness that is everywhere observing itself is real. If that makes sense. But at the end of this argument, I argue that thing like you described happen because the universe and reality doesn't function on the same moral framework as humans, not even all humans function on the same moral framework.  \n\nNow for the dream segment, this is not what I believe but I was mainly just defending the other guys argument that people are misunderstanding. I'm not trying ti convince you that you are asleep, but point out that in a dream, you don't know you are dreaming, even with lucid dreaming, you dint know you are dreaming before you become lucid, your example, you would have to check your palm, compare your current circumstances to what you believe to be reality, this pushes inti the idea, that reality where you check your palm and think it's normal, could be similar, but when you look at your palm, since you are unaware of an actual reality to compare it to, you can't check for discrepancies between \"reality\" and and what I'll call \"real reality\". Since we are unaware of what reality is actually like outside of our brains filter, we can't prove whether or not reality is real, every argument is pretty evenly valid and arguable.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Ethics, much like technology, is a means to an end. And ethical reasoning, therefore, helps to determine which ethical viewpoint(s) is a useful and/or efficient means to that end.\n\nNow, to be sure, I think that one can sometimes deduce what ends a person seeks to work towards from their stated ethical intuitions. But what I have tended to find is that people's ethical viewpoints tend to center around themselves and those people who are important to them, and seek to cast those things that harm that group of people and their interests as being, as Thomas Nagel might put it, not just bad *for them*, but bad *period*.\n\nTaking a step back, and understanding the various ethical theories out there helps to make one's ethical decision-making somewhat less self-interested. At least, in my experience of speaking with people.", "label": 0}
{"text": "> Wouldn't then there be no inherent value in anything without a conscious observer?\n\nYes, exactly.  It's the old existentialist vs. essentialist debate and I'm very much an existentialist (and I don't think it's unfair to say you're an essentialist?).  I don't believe there is any inherent beauty or meaning in anything outside of what we create or appreciate.  Sounds can exist, patterns of sounds can exist, but music can *only* exist when an observer impresses intentionality and emotion onto it.\n\n> As an artist myself I think I would agree with him on this. It is a strange phenomenon, I never truly feel like what I make is my own creation, it's a bit hard to explain in words...\n\nSure.  I'm an artists myself; music, audio, and frame animation.  Yet I have the exact opposite position from you.  I feel like *creating* something from nothing is the whole point, rather than feeling like you're tapping into something, or drawing something out, especially when there's a kind of momentum that takes over where a project seems to unravel itself.  Some artists love to feel they're \"discovering\" themselves or the world, rather than simply creating something from their imagination.  And that's cool, but that's not my position.\n\nIt's also interesting that you use the word \"divine\" because that, for me, is the great disqualifier of the conversation.  Not to say your position doesn't have any validity, but rather that it makes exploring the idea impossible.  If you can't separate the intentional from the intentless, how can you assess the nature of beauty?  To see a mountain as only having *inherent* beauty if it was placed there.  And it always requires some sort of ambiguous inexplicable cosmic event (a God, an un/sub-conscious collective, a mysterious phenomenon) to be the placer.\n\nWhich is fine if you believe that.  But it makes exploring an opposing viewpoint impossible when you can't assume the idea of a mountain is no more or less than any entangled physics anywhere else.  You can only explore existentialism if you can start with the idea that a mountain is simply rocks and atoms, or from our view, only colors and shapes.  Because then you can separate the canvas and the paint - the mountain isn't the painting, it's canvas...while our emotion of it is the paint.  Does that make sense?\n\nAnd that becomes the central axiom to both our arguments.  You think there is something placing it there, and I think *we* are placing it there.\n\nThat said, let me be clear - I think you have a wonderful world view.  It's very romantic.  I hope that doesn't sound patronizing because it's not.  I mean it.  I think your view is as valid as mine, as credible as mine, and far be it from me to say you're wrong and I'm right because neither is true.\n\nIt is a very fascinating conversation, and I love that you wrote what you did, but I do object to the idea of me being \"wrong\" because I'm no more wrong nor right than you.  The inexplicable magic behind my world view is the nature of being and the inexplicable magic behind your world view is an inexplicable magician.  Neither of us has a truth, just what we choose to believe.  Don't you think?", "label": 0}
{"text": "> why is it preferable to have an ethic that is not centered on tribal or self-centered concerns?\n\nWhy would *I* prefer to have an ethic centered on *your* tribal or self-interested concerns? Going back to Thomas Nagel, he posited that one should be willing to give others the same consideration that one demanded of them. That, of necessity made ethics broader than just the self and those one cares about.\n\nPeter Singer echoes this, with his idea that our moral circles should include everyone, no matter how far away from us they might be. (And I think that Mr. Singer has a more concrete, if not necessarily more broadly acceptable, method of deciding when to stop.)\n\nOne could make the point that both Mr. Nagel and Mr. Singer built a theory from their initial ethical intuitions, but I don't believe that either of them simply ended there; rather, they followed the threads outward and said that intuitions that ran counter to the broader pattern should be changed.", "label": 0}

But when they held up \"businesses prioritize honesty, fair practices, and respect for consumers,\" as ethical matters, they said nothing about empathy. And one need not be empathic to behave in such a way.\n\nAnd so I would say that I disagree with the idea that trust stems from empathy. There are people whom I trust to do things, that I don't empathize with, and I don't believe empathize with me. But to go back to my original point, I think your discussion with hi5orfistbump was derailed due to a failure to agree on definitions up-front.", "label": 0}

In that case I don't really see the reason for calling it ethics.\n\nFor example, why should I accept the principle that I should give other the consideration I demand of them? If the end of ethics is my own interests then I should just pretend to do that so that you would do the same to me, but then stop doing it whenever I no longer stand to gain from it (of course assuming that you think the end of ethics is self-interest).\n\n\\>but I don't believe that either of them simply ended there; rather, they followed the threads outward and said that intuitions that ran counter to the broader pattern should be changed.\n\nI don't want to suggest that you shouldn't do that. In fact I take myself to be doing that through the entire course of the article! The vast majority of the article is me raising possible relevant differences and showing why they are not relevant. But the reason that they are considered candidates is that they are intuitively plausible.   \n  \nThe best example from the article I can think of here is the point with blame. It is an intuitive principle that two people can't be responsible for the same action. But by drawing out the implications of that principle (that you wouldn't be responsible for giving the murderer a knife), we come to see that the negation of the implications is more intuitive/plausible than the principle itself, thus we reject it. I think that this is broadly the structure of all the arguments I give here, and really the structure of most ethical reasoning.  \n  \nEveryone has many contradictory intuitions. They obviously can't all be correct and I don't want to suggest that we should consider them so.

{"text": "**ABSTRACT**:\n\n> Knowledge, like other things of value, can be faked. According to Hawley (2011), know-how is harder to fake than knowledge-that, given that merely apparent propositional knowledge is in general more resilient to our attempts at successful detection than are corresponding attempts to fake know-how. While Hawley's reasoning for a kind of detection resilience asymmetry between know-how and know-that looks initially plausible, it should ultimately be resisted. In showing why, we outline different ways in which know-how can be faked even when a given performance is successful, and in doing so, we distinguish how know-how can be faked (no less than know-that) via upstream and downstream indicators of its presence, and within each of these categories, we'll distinguish (in connection with detection resilience) both faking symptoms and (various kinds of) criteria. The unappreciated resilience of faked knowledge-how to successful detection highlights a largely overlooked dimension of social-epistemic risk\u2013\u2013risk we face not just in our capacity as recipients of testimony, but in our capacity as both (would-be) apprentices and clients of knowledge-how.", "label": 0}

Our agency is miniscule, and where we have the most of it -- through the work we put into the system to keep it running -- our cooperation is compelled rather than voluntary.\n\nWhen cracks emerge in the system and opportunities to act present themselves, I think it's important to take note of them and try to participate, if one can endure the risk (e.g., there's a chance that there might be a general strike in the United States in 2028).\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that we're basically peasants without any real agency. Only under times of extreme social stress does our agency ever break through.

{"text": "I vehemently reject any biological/neurological theories regarding homosexuality. And you should too. They all fall apart when observing reality. There are butch lesbians that look more masculine than men. And lesbians are attracted to them and never to feminine men. Also there are transgender lesbians out there and gay women are attracted to them as well, even if they still posses certain elements of masculine biology. If homosexuality was merely the product of genes and mutations, then how come it  goes beyond biology and gender conforming aesthetics? I doubt something as rudimentary as epigenetic mutations can create a sexual attraction mechanism that comes equipped with a gender studies degree and Judith Butler's entire academic work during the fetal development stage.  \n\nAlso, if homosexuality had genetical/neurological causes, then how come heterosexual men who transition become lesbian trans women? Did their sexuality change once they transitioned? It didn't. Just the descriptor for their sexuality changed. The sexual attraction , despite not undergoing any actual physical changes, shifted only semantically. From heterosexual to homosexual. Because these words are descriptors of a sexual identity, not descriptors of the biological sexual functions in one's brain. \n\nThe body can \"know\" it experiences sexual arousal for a certain gender. But without a word to conceptualise the sexual identity behind that physical response, the mind cannot be aware of what the body experiences. Studies on heterosexual individuals have shown numerous times that they can experience physical arousal for the same gender. But the words \"bisexual\" or \"gay\" don't apply to them. Because they are descriptors of identity, not biology.   \n\nBiologically, that man's body \"knew\" he wasn't attracted to women. Cognitively, he wasn't able to conceptualise it because he lacked the word for it. And because he lacked the word for \"homosexuality\", he was unable to realise that the physical responses of his body when in the close company of men were actually a result of sexual arousal due to him being sexually attracted to men.  \n\nI don't like to make assumptions regarding ancient Greece either. Frankly to me it seems like their experience of homosexuality was a mirror to today's society, in which it is women who are more open to engaging in sex and affection with other women, despite not being gay themselves. Meanwhile men regressed to very strict heterosexual notions of masculinity. We will never know if homosexuality was a recognised sexual identity in ancient greece or if it was merely the result of cultural openness to experiencing pleasure with the same sex/gender.

{"text": "I disagree. I propose a thought exercise. If an entire isolationist society is obligatory heterosexual, and 95% of its individuals are heterosexual by nature, and a person grows up with no concept of sexual identity, and does not feel sexual attraction to the opposite gender, how would they know what sexual attraction is supposed to feel like? What would his frame of reference be when trying to understand what sexual desire is supposed to feel like? If the man was bisexual, then it would have been easy because he could have compared the experience of being attracted to his wife to the feelings he also got around close male friends. \n\nBut this man was completely gay. Therefore, completely lacking any frame of reference. He literally did not know that homosexuality is possible. He literally could not conceptualise that sex between men is possible or how it would look like. He thought his feelings towards his male best friend were a sign of a deep friendship. Despite his body experiencing physical signs of arousal, he was unable to identify what those physical responses were. His body was functioning correctly, yet his mind lacked the language to conceptualise his experiences.  \n\nOnce he discovered the word \"gay\" and what it means, he instantly understood that he is gay. Accepted it without a problem. So it wasn't repression or internalised homophobia or denial.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Maybe this is my mistaken choice of words, but I am not conflating homosexuality with gay identity. I am using \"homosexuality\" to include everything possible, from a genetic disposition to \"deviancy\" in some abstract sense, to homosexual acts, to a full-on adoption of a gay identity, absent of those genetic factors. I was trying to be careful there, representing multiple possibilities.\n\nBy the way, I don't have much stake in this and am using your example for convenience. I am not promoting a genetics-only account of homosexuality, and I think such accounts are naive and don't track the evidence.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't consider trans individuals in an account of sexuality. Again, identity is self-predicative, and we wouldn't build a second-order concept around it. We'd want to stick to what's measurable, like individual genomes and sexual arousal. Sexuality, regardless of what it is, relates to sex. My position would be that genetics has a non-zero influence on same-sex attraction/arousal. Genetic factors are involved everywhere in human behavior\u2014why would an increased tendency toward homosexuality be magically exempt?\n\nRegarding language-before-thought: neuroscience abandoned this hypothesis many years ago. Non-linguistic thinking is absolutely possible, and we know this from studies on babies and animals. As a thought experiment, your conclusion would mean that pre-linguistic humans were incapable of understanding same-sex acts\u2014not terribly plausible, given they were engaged in complex social behavior and toolmaking.

{"text": "Pre-linguistic humans also probably had no taboos regarding homosexual intercourse because, like so many other animals, they engaged in it freely, for the purpose of pleasure or even raising young (birds are known to sometimes mate with the same sex for life and even adopt abandoned offspring to raise as their own).  \n\nHistorically, orgies were bisexual in nature, and most historical depictions show sexual acts depicted between individuals of the same sex. There is no genetic component to experiencing sexual pleasure and arousal. Two straight men can have sex and feel pleasure with one another. So many older lesbian women were married to men and some say they had no problems having sex with their husbands and feeling pleasure, despite not being sexually attracted to men.   \n\nThere is no such thing as a biological predisposition to homosexuality. Because literally every single human has the capacity to experience pleasure with any gender. Some lesbians watch gay male porn. Some heterosexual women have sex with other women. Men are just the same. But sexual attraction is a matter of gender,  not sex. We are attracted to genders, not biology. If tomorrow all women changed to look like men and adopt a hyper masculine presentation then most heterosexual men would lose their attraction to women. And i know that because I have not met one hetero dude to be attracted to ultra masculine butch lesbians. Because to them, those women might as well be a different gender. Sexual attraction is all about gender, not actual biology. And gender is an identity. Therefore to conceptualise it we need to know the right words first and foremost.  \n\nPsychology and philosophy operated for centuries under the assumption that homosexuality has a biological cause to it because those fields were developed in a patriarchal world founded on heteronormative traditions and morals.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm saying \"pleasure\" and \"happiness\" are synonymous for these purposes because pleasure has always been used broadly in utilitarian philosophy. The example of Mill's Felicific Calculus was showing that this was true even back in the early days. It remains true today. Here's an excerpt from Peter Singer:\n\n> Sidgwick has to concede that common sense shows some aversion to the idea that the sole ultimate end of our actions, and the standard of right and wrong, is **happiness, in the sense of maximizing pleasures**; but he thinks this aversion is due to some misunderstandings. He mentions four of them. First of all, in ordinary usage the word pleasure is often used narrowly, to suggest \u2018the coarser and commoner\u2019 feelings that we desire to have, rather than the more elevated desirable states of consciousness, which would be less likely to produce aversion. Moreover, we know that some pleasures will lead to great pain or the loss of more important pleasures. Since in many cases we have moral or aesthetic instincts warning us against such \u2018impure\u2019 pleasures, we do not want to even think that they could be part of ultimate goodness\u2026.Thus Sidgwick takes himself to have shown that **common sense is not really opposed to the idea that the ultimate good is pleasure**. \n\nUtilitarians never broadened their definition of pleasure. It was broad from the start. It remains broad. As Singer points out, some laypeople like the dude above might be confused by this because they often use the term more narrowly than philosophers do.\n\n> more often right now from modern thinkers is \"well-being\"\n\nI would expect both utilitarians and consequentialists to use the term \"well-being,\" so on its own that term would not clarify whether you're a utilitarian not.

This seems completely disproved by literally all of human history.    He then immediately contradicts himself on the next point, saying agony is universally undesirable because of the intuition of humans, then says we need to dispose of our deepest intuitions in order to reason ourselves to morality.  Then he says if everyone agrees on all the same facts, then they will come to the same conclusion.  He also says most intuitions are fine until a new or complex ethical situation comes up.  All the intuitions he mentions are religiously inspired though, he seems to not realize that the intuitions are not just default for all humans, they are the product of thousands of years of civilizational and religious development specifically in our Western civilization.  Genuinely I have trouble understanding why this guy is treated seriously at all as a \"philosopher\"... he just says things that are clearly not well-thought out.

{"text": "**ABSTRACT**:\n\n> The naturalized metaphysics promoted by Ladyman and Ross, among others, is often described as (neo)-Quinean metaphysics. This association with Quine's naturalism can, however, give a misleading impression of the aims and commitments of this kind of naturalized metaphysics. Contrary to Quine, these naturalized metaphysicians endorse metaphysical realism and offer wholesale arguments in favor of the epistemic standing of science-based metaphysics. Accordingly, this naturalized metaphysics comes closer to Roy Wood Sellars's evolutionary naturalism, especially since the theory of evolution is central to the criticism that naturalized metaphysics levels at nonnaturalized metaphysics. The paper argues that Sellars's naturalism is furthermore helpful (1) for explicating the naturalism of naturalized metaphysics, (2) for theorizing a more general naturalist basis for naturalized metaphysics, and (3) for suggesting where naturalized metaphysics is perhaps not naturalist enough, especially when it comes to considering the implications of the theory of evolution for its positive program.", "label": 0}

{"text": "So... going to co opt this to talk about my experience with moral philosophy. \n\nLong ago, I studied philosophy. I especially liked moral philosophy. Loved learning the rules and rationales of the various ethical systems. I was always trying to merge them, noticing the points of intersections and conflict. Proverbial train switches. An instinctive modernist.\n\nIn any case, I scratched the itch. Lost interest. Moved on. But, I still had the lexis. The skill at finding rough formalizations of people's moral systems, points of confluence and tension. The trained ability to notice certain things in a rich way. \n\nI remain fascinated by human desire to harmonize morality. Harmonize our moral sentiments with each other, but also to harmonize morality to adjacent and intersecting notions. Disharmony is uncomfortable to us and we are highly motivated to avoid it. \n\n***So... fireworks***. The argument here seems to be approximately utilitarian. The pleasure of fireworks for people vs the pain of fireworks for pets. \n\nWithin real people, I think these will rarely be diametrically opposed. People who don't like fireworks are likely more open to considering pets' feelings on the matter. People who love fireworks and pets will be more likely to see pets' discomfort as mild. People who see pets' discomfort as acute... they might stop enjoying fireworks as much. Harmony will be sought somehow. \n\nIf the argument made here succeeds, the way that success happens might look is people enjoying fireworks less. Perhaps they become actively distressing to more people, after becoming more aware of the pets' distress. Perhaps fireworks become less enjoyable for unrelated reasons. A cultural trend that has run its course. At that point, the pet argument may become effective. \n\nHumans are harmony seekers. So are our cultures and idea spaces.", "label": 0}

If your animal gets physically harmed because of fireworks, I'm going to put that on the owners. The fireworks happen at the same time every year. You know whether your animals like it or not.

(.50 * (+1 million ) + .5*(-500,000))\n\n> Now instead of a communist revolution, we can push policy to give kids in school free lunch.

Initially, responses can be harsh, rooted in a limited understanding that favors control or punishment.\n\nYet, as our knowledge expands, society often shifts toward approaches that prioritize acceptance, empathy, and support. For example, where LGBTQ+ people were once marginalized, people with disabilities stigmatized, or addiction treated solely as a crime, today we see increasing acceptance, inclusion, and a focus on treatment and rights. These changes align with a belief I hold: as we understand more about each other and the complexities of the human experience, our responses naturally tend to become more constructive, inclusive, and compassionate.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t claim this is a universal law, it resonates with my own observations. Over time, it seems that our solutions to human problems evolve toward greater harmony, helping us to build a society that better respects and values each person. This shift might be gradual, and it\u2019s not without setbacks, but I believe that progress, guided by deeper knowledge, leans toward unity and understanding.\n\nP.S: I just noticed now the responses because I didn't see any notifications.

{"text": "\u201cExample of a factoid about human nature: \"Humans are naturally lazy and would not have any motivation to work if all their needs would be catered to.\"\u00a0\n\nI think what your sayings is people are naturally motivated because that is the opposite of naturally lazy (correct me if I'm wrong). I presume when you say need you mean all all needs as in , physical, intellectual, physiological ect. If all needs are met they would have no way to keep doing the things they need because they wouldn\u2019t need them any more. Here is an example: A very curious person had a need to know everything and their need was met. They wouldn't be able to learn anything and wouldn\u2019t be curious any more so they would lose motivation not because they're lazy but because their need was met. People are motivated by what they don\u2019t have if you don't have a cake you bake one you bake one if you had an infinitely perfect cake you would have no need to bake one. One of the good things about humans being imperfect is it gives us reason to try.\n\n\u201cBig chain supermarkets throw away more food every year than a country's population can store in their pantry per square meter. The numbers exceed thousands of tons per chain, per country.\u201d\n\n(In America)\u00a0The thing about freedom is it gives people the ability to make stupid or immoral choices. Clearly we aren't free to murder we aren't an anarchy. As an American we agree to curtain things as a citizen like paying taxes and not murdering so we have the freedom to not agree to this but then we wouldn\u2019t be a US citizen.\n\nTo what extent do you think the government should be able to take away our freedoms?\n\n\"Example of a solution that is viable and yet rejected by most governments and opposed by people: \"universal basic income\"\".\n\n\u00a0If absolutely everyone was given a set amount of money, then money wouldn\u2019t be worth as much because everyone has it and the inflation would get worse and worse each time they were given the money. So the money they actually worked for would be worth less. This would be the most harmful to people in poverty who can\u2019t handle an economic crisis.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Thank you for proving my point. So what you are saying is that the solutions are not viable because of the language we built around the principles on which the world functions: \"economy\", \"inflation\", \"poverty\", \"motivation\". Those words are not the reason why we can't have universal basic income. They are used to mask the real culprit: economy. Capitalism. The only way to destroy those is to conceptualise them as incompatible with the future of humanity. \n\nYou just assumed the engine of labour is motivation. And if that is the case then you are correct. But what if we replaced it with self actualisation? If there is nothing else for me to work on or learn, then i will proceed to create new concepts to explore and write about them myself.   \n\nHow? By looking beyond my experience of reality and language. I devised a language based scheme inspired by cognitive theories. I am currently working with an autistic person to basically create artificial schemas that can be used to let them conceptualise their unique experience of reality and create new words to define what they were unable to conceptualise before due to lacking the necessary brain schema.  \n\nWe already invented 2 words for never understood before experiences. One relates to gender and am currently writing a paper on, as it looks to me that it could be the key to finally piecing together quite a lot of gender identity theories that always seemed to have something missing. \n\nThe other word is related to their experience of love. We suspect it could be the reason many autistic people cannot conceptualise their identity and are confused about why they don't feel like they have a self.   \n\nI have tested both for validity and whether these concepts extend to other people with autism. I found proof they extend even further than that, having been confirmed to be part of some neurotypical individual's experiences. And there is academic literature to support my findings. \n\nLanguage is our solution. Because a single word can change our understanding of reality.

{"text": "If the author has a PhD in Philosophy, they must surely be aware that realists don't argue that moral truths are arbitrary and might be anything, in the way a pebble you find on the beach might be any colour. The argument is that moral reality is rooted in objective facts about us and our existence, what those are depending on what flavour and system of realism you take. But you'll certainly see a lot of references to things like well-being, value, dignity, fairness, rationality.\n\nNor does the fact that some past societies justified slavery and racism undermine realism; rather, it shows that societies can be wrong about moral truths. This underscores the realist view that moral truths are not subject to popular opinion or cultural norms and remain stable even if ignored.\n\nIt seems like a very low effort piece, really just attacking caricatures of realism and relativism rather than any substance which has been written about those views over the centuries.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This author of this article confuses several ideas. Moral realism is *not* the opposite of moral relativism. Moral realism is an answer to the question \"are there such things as moral facts?\" Moral relativism is an answer to the question \"what are the truthmakers for moral statements?\" These are two different questions. In fact, moral relativism is a *subtype* of moral realism. Moral relativism is the thesis that the truthmaker of moral statements is something relative to the subject (for example, the speaker's attitudes, or the attitudes prevalent in the speaker's culture). Moral relativism says that the same statement could come out as true or false depending on who is uttering it, the same way that the statement \"my name is Bob\" can come out as true or false depending on who is uttering it. The only way it could even *be* true or false is if there is some fact that makes it true or false (like attitudes). So, moral relativism is a form of moral realism.\n\nThe proper contrast to moral realism is moral *antirealism*. This is also an answer to the question, \"are there such things as moral facts?\" Moral antirealism answers \"no.\" Some antirealists say that all moral statements are false, because there is nothing in the world to make them true. Others say that moral statements don't even express propositions in the first place.\n\nThe proper contrast to moral relativism is moral *objectivism*. This is an answer to the question \"what are the truthmakers for moral statements?\" It answers, \"objective facts that are independent of the speakers attitudes about them.\" So, a moral statement's truth is not dependent on anything about the speaker making it.\n\n\\>Are there objective moral truths?\u2019\u00a0\\[\u2026\\] The question in the case of the \u201cobjectivity of morality\u201d is, \u2018Should we have a moral backbone, standing firm in our strongest moral convictions?\u2019\n\nNo, the question of whether moral truths are objective is not a question about what we \"should\" do. Somebody could be a moral relativist and still say we should \"have a moral backbone.\" So long as their attitude (or their culture's attitude or whatever subjective is being relativized to under the given theory) is \"we should have a moral backbone,\" then it comes out as true when they say \"we should have a moral backbone.\" There's no problem there.", "label": 0}
{"text": "What is bewildering is that she has a Ph.D. in philosophy", "label": 0}
{"text": ">The moral realist claims that whether racism, slavery, and genocide are wrong is determined by an independent moral reality that has nothing to do with what anyone thinks. But here is the question: what if it turns out that this so-called moral reality dictates that slavery, racism, and genocide are morally right? Would they then be right?\n\nBy definition, yes.\n\n>Realists commonly respond by claiming that moral reality\u00a0*cannot*\u00a0turn out to be like that \u2013 that it cannot, for instance, dictate that our true moral obligation is to commit genocide and practice slavery. They engage in all sorts of philosophical gymnastics to assure us that such moral misfortune cannot befall us. But their optimism is baseless. We have no reason to think that an\u00a0*independent*\u00a0moral reality, which has nothing to do with what we consider good and decent, will miraculously turn out to align perfectly with our fundamental values. Therefore, a consistent moral realist must grant that our true moral obligation may turn out to be committing genocide and practicing slavery \u2013 in which case, according to the realist, that is what we ought to do. That is not exactly standing morally firm!\n\nThis is confusing the metaethical questions it raised with a third metaethical question: how can we know moral truths? Moral realism is not a thesis about moral epistemology. It's a thesis about moral ontology. It doesn't state *how* or *whether* we can know any particular moral truths. It just says they exist. Moral skepticism is an answer to the question \"how can we know moral truths?\" It's answer is \"we can't.\" The author just assumes moral skepticism to be true without giving an argument, and then acts like that somehow refutes moral realism, which is an answer to a *different question entirely.*\n\nAlso, to say that it's *possible* that something is the case is not to say that we *can't rule it out*. For example, it's *possible* that I am nine feet tall, in the sense that it is *not false by necessity* that I am nine feet tall. But I still know that I'm not nine feet tall. Something being contingently true doesn't stop it from being knowable.\n\n>That is why all philosophical accounts proposing one thing or the other as the ultimate moral source or authority are misguided. They are all looking for someone or something that could, in theory, just give us all the right answers to moral questions.\n\nNow the author is confusing the metaethical questions with ethical questions. Neither moral relativism nor moral realism are ethical theories that tell you *what* is right or wrong. They just say things about what rightness and wrongness are, and if they even are in the first place. Ethical theories that try to tell us what actions are right and which are wrong are things like, say, deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, etc.\n\nIt seems that this article is arguing that we use reflective equilibrium instead of grand ethical theories like deontology or utilitarianism to find out what the good and bad actions are, but it confuses that with questions about metaethics that have nothing to do with what the good and bad actions are.\n\nI'm surprised this came from a PhD who works in moral philosophy when it lacks a basic grasp of how the concepts in it relate to each other.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Regarding your first paragraph. Not at all, the decriminalization of drugs \u2014 in Portugal \u2014 was a much needed act, such that some other countries decided to follow the same route with some minor or major differences in their law. \n\nPicture this, [before the decriminalization] you're a person that smokes one small joint/spliff per day, each week you buy like 2/3 grams of weed or hash for your own consumption. So, you go and buy it and for some reason the police would stop you and find it with you. Because of those 2/3 grams you'd be getting a crazy amount of jail time, all because you like to smoke a joint or a spliff (this goes for all the other drugs). What this meant was, that each and every drug user, no matter the drug it was, would be getting jail time, the only crime being that you were a drug user. You can see how quickly jails started to get flooded.\n\nTo combat this, each drug was given a personal use limit (to a maximum of 5 or 6 days, depending on the drug), so for example, right now, you can have with yourself up to 10 grams of weed/hash and it counts as personal use, if you're caught with it, the weed/hash is taken from you, and you're sent to a sort of rehabilitation center (this depends on the drug, normally with weed users they're sent to a psychologist paid by the State). And this is the same for cocain, heroin, lsd, mdma, etc., but in the case of those drugs you're actually sent to a rehabilitation center, and of course, the drug is taken from you.\n\nNot to say that, if you're caught with like 13 grams of weed that you'll be sent to jail, if the case is seen as for personal use then you're fine as well. This is really just a way to discern from dealers and users. This way, dealers are given jail time and users receive help for their addiction.\n\nFor the ones that are of no help \u2014 as not everyone is able to be helped \u2014 the State and the Nacional Health Service tries their best to keep such users safe, by giving them the needed materials, for example, heroin addicts receive clean needles, bandages, etc., mdma, lsd, ketamine, etc., addicts are given ways of testing their drugs, etc. This helps with overdoses and intravenous diseases \u2014 which were a really big problem back in the 80s and 90s \u2014, and keeps prisons free of people whose only \"crime\" was being addicted to an illicit substance.\n\nAll this created safer environments for people to talk about drugs, drug consumption and drug addiction, because before that, if you'd say that you use x substance you'd be sent to jail right after. Nowadays, you can even walk to the police and say something like \"I've been using x for awhile and I need help\", they'll ask if you have with you, if yes, it is taken from you, and you're sent to rehabilitation center to be helped. No strings attached, no jail time, nothing.\n\nNow, the drive for experimentation is tricky, everyone will try a drug for a different reason. In my case it wasn't because of a family member or because of friends, it was entirely due to documentaries that I would watch as a kid, which created the curiosity in trying it out. The availability was in itself the actual problem: me being a kid (around 11/12 years old) and being able to reach an adult in the street and buy hash didn't help. (Hell I had to search on youtube \"how to smoke hash\" lol) That lead to, after some years, me trying cocain, then mdma, then lsd, etc., and since I was young it was harder to then fight such an addiction and control myself.\nBut obviously that if a kid grows up around drug usage the probability of such kid trying out the drug(s) is higher (also depending on their life growing up, which is more of a question to psychology) (this whole part of the question is more centered around psychology \u2014 in my view \u2014 so I'll abstain from saying much since that is not my area of study).\n\nI'm not for drug legalization, but I'm 100% for drug decriminalization.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">No, her argument is that moral realists give the wrong answer to the question \"Should we have a moral backbone, standing firm in our strongest moral convictions?\" because they commit themselves to standing for whatever the objective moral values happen to be.\n\nThese are the most charitable ways I can think to reconstruct her argument. Let me know if you can think of better ways, because I don't think these arguments work:\n\n**Erdur's Argument Against \"Moral Realism,\" v1:**\n1. If there are objective moral facts, then we lack justified beliefs about them.\n\n2. If we lack justified beliefs about objective moral facts, then we can't stand by our strongest moral convictions.\n\n3. But we should stand by our strongest moral convictions.\n\n4. Therefore, objective moral facts do not exist (from 2, 3).\n\nThe first premise is suspect. She supports it by simply saying she isn't satisfied with any account of moral knowledge on offer, dismissing them as \"mental gymnastics\" without even saying what they are. It seems that people who believe there are objective moral facts can argue we can stand by our strongest moral convictions by just having any one of the numerous views about how we can know such facts. Erdur doesn't give us reasons to believe that the views are insufficient other than her say-so.\n\n**Erdur's Argument Against \"Moral Realism,\" v2:**\n\n1. If objective moral facts exist, then it is possible that they differ from our strongest moral convictions.\n\n2. If it is possible that objective moral facts differ from our strongest moral convictions, then we should not be confident in our strongest moral convictions.\n\n3. Therefore, if objective moral facts exist, then we should not be confident in our strongest moral convictions (from 1, 2)\n\n4. But we should be confident in our strongest moral convictions.\n\n5. Therefore, objective moral facts do not exist (from 3, 4).\n\nI don't think this argument works. You can't argue from that something is possible to that we can't be confident that it's not the case. It is possible that I am nine feet tall, because it's not self-contradictory to say that I am nine feet tall. But I can still be confident that I am not nine feet tall. If she just wants to say it's epistemically possible that moral facts differ from our strongest convictions, it's not clear that the epistemic possibility is strong enough to undermine reasonable confidence, unless one wants to entertain radical skepticism and say we can only be confident in claims that have no epistemic possibility of being false.\n\n>No, her argument is that moral realists give the wrong answer to the question \"Should we have a moral backbone, standing firm in our strongest moral convictions?\" because they can't be confident in any moral values.\n\nI'm guessing it was your intention to type \"moral relativists\" here, because this part was in response to me talking about her argument against relativism.\n\nAccording to relativists, people can be confident in their moral statements. For a relativist, Speaker S\u2019s statement that \"slavery is wrong\" is true when the Speaker S (or her society or whatever, depending on the view) holds the attitude that slavery is wrong. S can be confident in the truth of her moral statement just by knowing her own (or her society\u2019s) attitudes. The fact that other people or members of other societies may express truly that \u201cslavery is right\u201d does nothing to undermine Speaker S\u2019s entitlement to the claim \u201cslavery is wrong.\u201d It's like how one person can say \u201cit is raining\u201d and another person can say \u201cit is not raining,\u201d and the fact that one is right does not necessarily mean the other is wrong. There may be no disagreement, if those people are standing in two different cities, and so disagreement in this case need not lower anyone's confidence in their belief.\n\nNow you may say, \u201cthe author describes \u2018moral relativism\u2019 as the view that we shouldn't be resolute in our moral convictions, because that has sometimes led to evil. So, statements about \u2018moral relativism\u2019 in the conventional sense do not address the view she has in mind.\u201d Fine, but then the view she describes then seems to be a strawman, anyway. Of course if you take the term \u201cmoral relativism,\u201d which has pretty well-accepted meanings in philosophy, and use it to refer to an obviously self-refuting view made up for the article, you can say you've critiqued relativism.\n\n\n>No it is not. It is a way of giving an affirmative response to the question \"Should we have a moral backbone, standing firm in our strongest moral convictions?\" \n\nBut she doesn't even show how it avoids the problems she says realism and relativism lead to. All she says is _we have to critically think and figure it out._ How? Where are we pulling the normative premises from in order to support the normative conclusions under consideration? How are we any more confident in those premises than if moral facts are objective? The only answer is \"we have to think really hard about the particular facts.\" What facts? Some of those facts will have to be normative. Where do those facts come from? Couldn't we be wrong about them?", "label": 0}

How could it be?\n\nMy question, then:\n\nWhere is the line between loving someone/thing enough to will good for them/want them to be the best version of themselves AND preferring someone/thing turn into an entirely different person/thing 'because' of one's love for them? If they turn into a completely different person/thing, then they aren't the thing we 'love' anymore....right? Yet, of course we want what we love to be the best version of itself I think. \n\nSo when does it stop being love if it even does?\n\n(PS, in this thread because love is a philosophical topic and I am just beginning this line of questioning, so I thought I'd try my luck here)", "label": 0}
{"text": "At this point they're mostly accurate descriptions of foundational beliefs on the American right. Project 2025 is sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, and racist. Stripping women of reproductive rights and basic medical care while openly degrading women who don't have children is misogynistic. Continually making up lies about legal immigrants (or illegal for that matter) is xenophobic. Openly using white supremacist language, going to their conferences, and working closely with self-identified white supremacists is supporting racism. Trying to deprive trans people of medical care, saying that LGBTQ people aren't allowed to acknowledge that they're LGBTQ, continually lying about people forcibly conducting sex changes, and more is homophobic.\n\nYou can pretend they're \"sneer words\". But when people are openly parroting these ideas, openly advocating for stripping away basic rights, and constantly supporting hateful ideologies then those \"sneer words\" just become truth.\n\nThe American right is sexist. It is homophobic. It is racist. It is xenophobic. Their ideologies are hateful and harmful to people.", "label": 0}

{"text": ">No, I can fully understand their values without agreeing or holding their values myself even for a time, or pandering to values I think are immoral a-priori. \n\nNo, you can\u2019t. You have to be able to accept those values at least in the \u201cfor the sake of argument\u201d sort of way.\n\n>I can fully understand them and think they are immoral - that the fact they hold such a value can make them an indecent human being and it does not make me a better person to acquiesce or entertain that in any or all cases! \n\nOf course it does. Moralists are awful people, so being less of a moralist by definition makes you a better person.\n\n>my being able to simulate the argument someone else would make or agree with does not always improve discourse, even in good faith. \n\nIt does. It literally improves *your* discourse, if only by making you better able to refute their points.\n\n>(a self-proclaimed racist holds a genuine axiomatic belief that certain humans are greater or lesser than others \n\nHow many \u201cself-proclaimed\u201d racists do you encounter? In any event, it is an interesting example because you are simply wrong. Such a person *might* believe that racial inequality exists, certainly, but they don\u2019t have to. They might just believe that society works best when people stick to their own kind. They might simply dislike certain other races, period. Or they might think that \u201cracist\u201d is nothing but a sneer word and so adopt the label ironically. And those are just the possibilities that spring instantly to mind. The point is you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t bother to find out.\n\n>there is no reconciling my beliefs with that no matter how well I am able to embody their arguments \n\nSo? No one said that making a point of understanding someone else\u2019s point of view means you have to reconcile it with your own beliefs. This sounds like an implicit admission that you are afraid your own views are weak enough that if you listened to your opponents you would change your mind. Maybe you would! That\u2019s okay. You can\u2019t ever hope to change someone else\u2019s mind unless you are willing to risk having yours changed too.\n\n> the point is that understanding the other position if the other position holds contradictory axioms is irreconcilable, and that\u2019s just true at a basic logic level, and it is naive to think otherwise.\n\nEvery position on a complex political issue contains contradictions, unless you go full monstrous fanatic. The key is identifying them in both your own reasoning and in other\u2019s, and understanding how people resolve them in their own minds.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The worst thing you can say about a statement of fact is that it is wrong. The worst thing you can say about an argument is that it is flawed. Ranting about how something is sexist, xenophobic, etc as you do here is just a verbose way of saying you disagree with it. But since that is not the same as saying its premises are wrong or its arguments flawed, it raises the suspicion that you spew the sneer words because you can\u2019t say that, and know it. The only take away from your post is that you apparently think Project 2025 is justified, and are angry about it. It would be much better and more convincing to actually learn how to argue against it.", "label": 0}
