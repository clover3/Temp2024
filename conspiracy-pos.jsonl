It didn't work.  It has encouraged NATO to invest in anti-missile systems because an 80 percent fail rate makes missile defense feasible again.\n\nIn fact that anti-missile game has an interesting advertising self-feedback loop.  When they protect populated areas their work is organically advertised as civilian or news-captured footage.  A couple of Patriot batteries had some limited success against Iraqi SCUDS in 1991.  The Israelis were already working on their various systems like Iron Dome and decided to stick with it.  NATO asked for and got a ton of Patriots.\n\nNow we see a layered anti-missile defense working over densely populated areas in Israel and everyone is going to want that.  All because someone drank the fuel line cleaner, fed the black market, skipped decades of maintenance, falsified reports, and so on, a systemic layer of bullshit that suggests that the Russians might only have a handful of functional missiles.", "label": 1}

Because greed is a sin in every religion. And the Jews are the greediest of them all. That\u2019s why when H took power he made interest based lending illegal (he also made porn illegal, but that\u2019s because of the sexual agendas Jews were pushing on children at the time but that\u2019s a different story), which instantly boosted Germany\u2019s economy to one of the greatest in the world at the time. He knew that interest based lending kept the middle and lower class under the Jew owned banks thumb. Get educated you Zionist sympathizer. The Jews also fund and support genocide going on in Guatemala, Indonesia, and many other countries around the world. These are all facts. Now go cry somewhere else", "label": 1}

So what do you do? Bring yourself down to their level. Grab a handful of each path, and let God guide you in teaching them better.\n\nI understand this is difficult. This path is virtually walking into the fire, but that's exactly what Jesus did. He sat with Soothsayers, tax collectors, and various other men(and women) of ill repute, and instead of berating them for ignorance, he listened to their problems, showed them what was causing those problems, and hiked up his big boy panties and FIXED those problems if they couldn't do it themselves.\n\nSo many \"Christians\" today are so up in arms about this \"cult\" or that \"new policy\", when they should be getting off their asses and showing us how it's done.\n\nSo your little Idol has some competition now, grow up.

{"text": "A long time ago I listened to someone who was generally accurate. He seemed to imply that he thought that there was the possibility of Israel being navigated into a scenario where direct, open conflict with Iran would happen and that Israel probably would take major damage from Iran, and from the fighting. He implied that it could have been a plan long in the making, and relayed something going back to the Reagan administration, and then to someone's reaction that he personally witnessed during the morning on 9/11.He had an anti-Israel bias, but there was enough 'information' and 'dots' that enough breadcrumbs were there - although I have started to majorly doubt his analysis, for example, he portrayed Hezbollah as being much stronger. His scenario is almost exactly how he said it would start. It starts in fits, and jumps, stops, then continues again until it rolls to a start. However, Iran would APPEAR to be in a much weaker position now, but of course, a cornered animal is potentially much more violent. A dying regime doesn't need any missiles as insurance. It launches them. Best wishes friends, I have been feeling uneasy since that first Iranian missile barrage, because that 'style' of attack seems to be the harbinger for what COULD occur if missiles were launched in magnitude. Air shootdown rates have been impressive, but of course impressively expensive, too, and missile volume and projectile quantity greatly reduces efficacy favoring the aggressor. Think of this post as the 10th Man Doctrine. Someone needs to suggest the possibility of the bizarre, however uncomfortable, so that if it may occur, it can be more effectively countered. In the IDF Command right now, I would be advocating for extreme de-escalation after any Iranian response we get from here, and I would have also advocated against the recent strikes on Iranian soil prior to them being authorized, but in a large part because I personally overestimated Iran's air deterrence capability and Israeli strike capacity based on incorrect information, but again still, in an effort to forestall the result of the aforementioned scenario. If Israel can complete the trifecta, and negate Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, that is very good, but I do not think it is wise to force an inevitable victory too soon, and in a way that could be dangerous, but based on what I've seen, I would absolutely acknowledge that the military decisions made so far starting with the Gaza neutralization operation have been correct, and effective, and I am sure that my own information is inadequate for the full picture. A certain hoax letter that was in the British museum also comes to mind as something odd. Something extremely important to watch for I think is any collateral damage to the Temple Mount and to the Dome of the Rock. In a big missile barrage, debris or even hits might inflame religious opinion in the Arab world or in Israel based on which party takes responsibility or is assigned responsibility for damaging important religious sites of the other nation's religion. For example, let's say the Dome takes some chrome and the Khomeini blames Israel for it. Then, a Mu\u1e25ammad al-Mahd\u012b, (VAJA maybe?) maybe suddenly appears and declares jihad in tandem with the lifting of the Fatwa against nuclear development. Please be aware that exotic situations, while extremely unlikely, are better anticipated, in my opinion, and planned for, because security situations during events of global magnitude can be fluid. Everything we have seen so far has massively been in Israel's favor, and rightfully so. Just please be in a state of heightened awareness, because until this current stage is through, I see shadows of risks of unexpected unknown 'unknowns'. The accuracy of some of the above analysis though is most likely influenced by that source's apparent personal bias, regarding Eschatology, but I also acknowledge that this person I listened to could have been deliberately creating memes for his own purposes. He who thinks, wins.", "label": 1}

The indictment also charges these defendants with aggravated identity theft, false registration of a domain name, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Two defendants, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk and Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, are charged with a separate conspiracy to commit computer crimes, relating to hacking into the computers of U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of 2016 U.S. elections, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.

They fear Donald Trump and/or people part or related to the United States Government may want to hurt them for seeing it and wanting people to know about it. They have more they want to write which I'll write after this. I want to post this ASAP and They said they are afraid for their safety and wish they could come on a podcast like the Joe Rogan and tell their story. I'm going to write what they've said and what they think. They believe this picture is of the eye of providence, the eye of God. The eye of providence is on the dollar bill within a triangle and it says annuit coeptis which means he (God) has favored or favors their undertakings. They believe God has favored this persons goals who took this picture. They said theyve been in dangerous situations after seeing the eye of procidence and has almost died several times and people tried to hit their vehicle on public roads 5-7 times at least within 3-4 hours one morning They said they've seen in a picture a triangle on their forehead, it may have to do with the fact that they said they studied trigonometry which is related to math and measuring angles of triangles; and this person wanted to use their knowledge to help the world. The person says on the right of the joint in the picture of the joint there is half a face with another eye, what appears to be the egyptian key of life the Ankh and they said they saw the numbers 354 on their left hand and on the joint there is a 3 and a 5. The 4 they think could be related to the music artists group 4 pockets full because that was one of their favorite music artists, Lil Baby. They love the song Global by Lil Baby. They said they checked the design of the paper and say that it did not appear because of the design of the paper. They checked several different pieces and tried to see if it could be because of that. They concluded it was not. If Donald Trump suggests killing anyone for any reason. Especially just because of thinking something, then this person believes Donald Trump is going against God's wishes and is trying to make our society like a dystopian one (bad) in some ways. They believe that if Donald Trump does this he could be deemed an enemy of this country; and the constitution or the law gives people the right to defend this country from enemies both foreign and domestic. So if Donald Trump could be considered an enemy of this country, then to defend this country he should be impeached if he becomes president or replaced Like the one in the book 1984. The person believes people should buy guns. The person believes Donald Trump is trying to promote thought crime like in the book 1984. So that he can control, manipulate, and hurt people. He says that there is an issue of people saying that someone sounds like they're thinking about something and then saying it does sound like that even though it can't be proven and it's not against the law to sound some way, and they believes people doing this whether it be people part or related to the government, police, and citizens in the country the United States of America and around the world; they are doing this and using it to abuse and hurt other people. She is afraid if this topic is discussed orally it could lead to people being hurt. So unless people are assured of their safety they urge them to only discuss this through text unless they are 100% assured of their safety. They said the possibility even if it wasn\u2019t true; is too dangerous to ignore. They said they want it spread as much as possible; especially to news deliverers, famous people, podcasters so that the potential for the world to be harmed significantly is reduced as much as possible. The eye of providence is also on the dollar bill, the United States currency so the country obviously regards it enough to include it on one of its most powerful assets", "label": 1}

It is pretty well known Toyota and Lexus are the highest quality cars in terms of reliability and my experience has shown me that. \n\nI\u2019m not a car guy and I\u2019m not an expert on the logistics of car assembly. Do a little research on all the different models made in the last ten years yourself? All I know is the research I did and the serial number show me it was completely assembled/made in Japan. The research I did also showed this particular model was known for being higher quality/more reliable than the slightly different models that weren\u2019t completely assembled in Japan and that my particular model is known for being higher quality and more reliable which was the selling point for me. My friend who\u2019s a car guy affirmed my decision and told me to go for it so I did. My experiences with ford, jeep, and now Toyota have also shown I made the right choice.\n\nWithin a year of owning my ford and jeep the transmissions went out at a mileage they really shouldn\u2019t have gone out on. Ball joints had to be replaced on the jeep, along with multiple other issues with both. The jeep was bought with a rebuilt engine because the engine went out on the original owner far before it should have which is why they were selling it, they were tired of all the issues and I got a good deal. The mustang was my dream car growing up and was a family friends car I bought from them and ik they treated it well, it also had tons of issues. \n\nIn my experience, my Toyota has only ever needed oil changes while my American cars both had many issues far sooner than they should have. I\u2019d be willing to bet a lot of money the transmission on my toy at least twice as long as the transmission on my jeep or ford. If you go ask mechanics what the highest mileage they\u2019ve seen on a car, it will all be Toyota, Jesus, and Honda. \n\nIf you really want proof Toyota is higher quality than ford or jeep, I suggest you go visit some car forums online, read reviews, and ask mechanics.", "label": 1}

They had a dozen or more different schemes going on - most of them leaning on the mail-in ballots.   Gone were the days of busing voters to different polling stations.  COVID gave them camouflage more than anything else.  \n\nIf you deny this, do a quick study into Florida over the last 10 years.   Florida use to be a swing state - THE swing state.   Why was that?   Because, like Philadelphia (and Atlanta lately), Democrats had a massive stronghold in Broward County - run by a corrupt POS Brenda Sipes.    DeSantis,  who is possibly the most popular governor in Florida history, BARELY beat an actual crackhead to win his first election as governor.    One of the first thing he did, as governor, was get rid of Brenda Sipes.    And then - WHAM - Florida is a +10 R state.   Amazing what happens when you evict the cheaters.\n\nSame thing could happen in PA, MI, Georgia.. honestly probably most states.", "label": 1}
