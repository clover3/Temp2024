And Starliner did return safely.\n\nSecond, Starliner issues don't cost NASA anything more. Its a fixed price contract. The sunken cost is with Boeing. And they have to fly or pay back.\n\n\"Also to my point, its doesn't matter unless they make it to space.\"\n\nWho? Starliner made it to space. Are you talking about Blue Origin? They have been in space, but not in orbit. However, they are building an orbital vehicle and do have plans to do drastically more in orbit. Which is where Starliner comes in. If they want to achieve their future goals, they need to be able to get people to orbit. And BO doesn't have a human rated orbital capsule. So they would have to start from scratch, likely taking 5-10 years and costing a few billion dollars.\n\n\"They are not a comparison\"\n\nThere are literally 3 capsules in operation today throughout the ENTIRE PLANET. Starliner has gotten people into orbit safely. If Starliner were built in Russia or China, they would have already been using it to send people back and forth to orbit. Even NASA would have returned crew on Starliner had they not had the option of using Dragon. Blue Origin doesn't need a capsule as good or better than SpaceX's Dragon. They just need something to start with. \n\n\"Anything not reusable will never be viable so anyone\"\n\nStarliner is reusable.", "label": 0}

The Wall Street Journal repeats long-ago debunked claims that Starlink ever turned off service for Ukrainian soldiers. Starlink\u2019s contributions to the Ukrainian defense and the Ukrainian people are indisputable. Starlink has kept Ukrainians online and connected to the world throughout the conflict and Starlink has defended itself against major efforts to disrupt that connection, at great cost to the company.\n \n> Regarding Taiwan, as even the Taiwan government has confirmed, Starlink is not available there because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates. This has nothing to do with Russia or China.", "label": 0}

So every month we're measuring we're counting the sunspots. We also count we are also measuring radio emissions. There's different ways we can determine the solar maximum, but essentially it's the number of sunspots. And we're in that period now when we're seeing the most sunspots. And so the last couple years we were picking up we were in a kind of peak phase. Now it'll be another year or two that will start going down from that peak phase.

{"text": "Attacking a satellite in the GEO belt is much harder as rides to this altitude are much less frequent and more costly and economics usually dictate that any spare launch vehicle capacity goes toward topping off the fuel tanks of the main satellite, so they very rarely have options for rideshares that might be affordable.  So access is very expensive, and rare.  On top of that the greater distance to earth makes the communications to control the spacecraft more difficult and much more regulated due to competition from telecommunications companies.  So it's unlikely anyone is able to easily sneak up  there.  Not impossible though, it just really cuts down on the list of potential groups that could pull this sort of thing off.

There are a lot of old cold war era satellites, and modern Chinese satellites that are defunct or have already been destroyed. As they are in higher orbit, they are not going to automatically burn down like western modern constellations, so eventually they will have to be dealt with. Hopefully with cheap access to space, Starship will be able to deliver vehicles that can clean up those orbits.

{"text": "_Most_ new rocket companies are either going hydrolox or methalox - that is, hydrogen, or methane, and liquid oxygen (\"lox\"). So they don't use any more oil that most outfits. It's the people using \"kerolox\" (kerosene and oxygen) that do that - *eg* SpaceX's Falcon 9. And even SpaceX is trying to move away from kerolox. \n\nBut that said, there's LOTS of new rocket companies, especially when you include Europe and Asia (particularly China - there's TONS of rocket companies in China). Not everyone is avoiding kerolox.\n\nHydrolox and kerolox both burn \"sootless\" - they produce (respectively) water, and a combo of CO2 and water, as exhaust. Which obviously has its own issues and concerns - but dumping oil waste isn't one of them.\n\n---\n\nThe main thing to remember about all of this is that at current levels of launches, rockets are dwarfed by things like the airline industry and shipping, even considering their prodigious exhaust. When you add it all up.\n\nAnd it's generally thought that the rocket market is in the process of \"maturing\" - that is, there's lots of startups because people see a lot of opportunity and are actively inventing new things. This won't last forever - eventually there will be a consolidation in the market, because the market will settle on several styles of transport. And then few players will survive. That's part of the reason for all the players now, they're all hoping they'll become one of the standards.\n\nThe big question everyone has is, what will the overall market look like after things mature? No one really knows. Everyone's got their own theory, and/or a way of looking at it.\n\nThe current problem with the rocket market is that it's _supply-constrained_ - if you want to launch your own comms constellation, you basically have to build your own rocket to do it. Because there's no time on the SpaceX launch schedule for you - they're too busy doing NASA, Space Force, NRO/DOD, and Starlink launches.\n\nSo the question is: what happens when supply is 100% fulfilled? Can it even be fulfilled at the prices companies could reach in 10-20 years? Perhaps the market is not that much bigger than it is now - but then people are betting billions that it is, at the same time.\n\nSo waste, in general, could turn into a major problem, both on Earth and in orbit, if the market goes gangbusters. It's hard to say. It depends how successful all these startups, and SpaceX, turn out to be.", "label": 0}

The transmitted radiation induces currents in the earth, and the waves travel over the earth\u2019s surface, being attenuated according to the energy absorbed by the conducting earth. The reason that horizontal antennas are not effective for ground wave propagation is that the horizontal electric field that they create is short circuited by the earth.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation\n\nHere's a kinda long (30 minute) ham radio presentation on it;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpY5hUxOS8", "label": 0}

{"text": "It depends on popularity. Geosynchronous and Geostationary are at a very specific altitude, so the volume allotted to each satellite is much lower than elsewhere. More importantly, Geostationary is a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of 0 degrees. Until recent times, it was the most popular orbit, and we have been leaving defunct satellites up there for a while. This couples them because any geosynchronous satellite passes through the geostationary belt twice per day; which generates a higher risk; and of course, the deorbit time of geosynchronous orbit is about 100 times longer than the distance between now and the first human civilizations.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Minimizing gravity losses is ultra-important when considering a reusable architecture as the first stage will have to squeeze out as much velocity as possible while also saving enough fuel to RTLS. More thrust means that the booster can do as much work against gravity as possible, vs Saturn V which had to spend much more fuel fighting against gravity. The Raptor sea-level is pretty much optimized for pure thrust when on the ground. If they decided to optimize the first stage for efficiency, there would be trade-offs for thrust and staging velocity, and that defeats the whole purpose of having a reusable booster in the first stage. If hypothetically, Raptor was optimized for efficiency by having a larger nozzle/bell, the larger nozzle itself would add weight.  In addition, the higher staging velocity would result in a longer boostback burn and higher peak heating during RTLS. In this case, thrust is king. It just is not very feasible to have an ultra-efficient first stage on a reusable launch vehicle. F9 and Starship have a TWR of 1.5 for the reasons listed.", "label": 0}
