As you can see, responses to the question \u201chow long did it take you to get HRT\u201d vary from \u201ctwo years\u201d to \u201cfirst appointment\u201d.\n\nHere in Canada, you go to any doctor, not your own doctor who knows you. They ask a battery of questions, but if you say you want to transition, the best practice path is to affirm the identify and start the patient on hormone therapy if that\u2019s what they want. Counselors or doctors who do not affirm the identity are called transphobic and risk censure.

For example, they may require you to have a letter from a psychiatrist or have a certain amount of \u2018lived experience\u2019 in your felt gender before they prescribe hormones. This is not illegal, but you can argue that it is against the ethics, standards, and guidelines of the healthcare provider\u2019s licensing body (such as their college or professional association), and file a complaint against the healthcare provider with that organization\n\nhttps://www.transrightsbc.ca/know-your-rights/healthcare/\n\nNot from my country, but similar is happening here: people who encourage people to explore their gender as opposed to just hanging out prescriptions are leaving the field. \n\nhttps://www.themainewire.com/2023/06/chilling-effect-states-are-cracking-down-on-therapists-who-dont-affirm-kids-trans-identities/", "label": 1}

The opposing situation is also true. Some people thrive this way, for others it may be terrible. Everyone is different. My relationships have never been more stable and enjoyable since I stopped having close female friends, and since I've started dating women who have very few/if any at all close male friends.

Easier said than done though ha haaa...  \n\nMindfulness meditation can really help, but if you find yourself drifting off into your own world instead of sleeping or getting out of bed to start your day. Calmly count down from 5. As in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and at 1 you have to get up and go. No excuses no thinking you just make yourself do it without delay. Automate the process. If you are in a bad place and your body doesn't respond, you just give yourself a few seconds without negative self talk, ideally you are letting your mind go blank, and just count down from 5 again and try to just \"go\" again. Roll off your bed onto the floor if you need to, just move, its easier to get off the floor than out of bed ha haaaa\n\nThis method is good for depression or other states that affect the minds \n\"go/no go\" neurology. If you lack the brain chemistry for motivation/goal orientation you just have to trick it into movement without giving the mind time to subvert it. \n\nSo. Instead of laying in bed with my insomnia for 5 hours, after hour 2 I make myself get up and go for a leisurely walk around the block. No excuses or thinking, I just get dressed and do it. I fall asleep pretty fast when I get home most of the time as it helps clear my cluttered mind that wants to slip back into maladaptive daydreaming.  \n\nIf I am in bed or stuck sitting somewhere when I should get up and go, the count down method is really good.

{"text": "Conducted by a group of researchers across the UK led by the University of Oxford and the University of Leicester, and published in Lancet Psychiatry, the research highlights the persistent and significant nature of these symptoms as well as the emergence of new symptoms years after COVID-19. 19 was first present.\n\nThe research was conducted with 475 participants (as part of the PHOSP-COVID study) who were invited to complete a set of cognitive tests via their computer and to report their symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue and their subjective perception of memory problems. They were also asked whether they had changed their occupation and why.\n\nThe researchers found:\n\nTwo to three years after being infected with COVID-19, participants scored on average significantly lower in cognitive tests (test of attention and memory) than expected. The average deficit was equivalent to 10 IQ points. Additionally, a substantial proportion reported severe symptoms of depression (about 1 in 5 people), anxiety (1 in 8), fatigue (1 in 4), and subjective memory problems (1 in 4), with these symptoms worsening over time. Although in many people these symptoms at 2-3 years were already present 6 months post-infection, some people also experienced new symptoms 2 to 3 years after their infection that they were not experiencing before. New symptoms often emerged in individuals who already exhibited other symptoms at six months post-infection. This suggests that early symptoms can be predictive of later, more severe issues, underscoring the importance of timely management. More than one in four participants reported changing their occupation and many gave poor health as a reason. Occupation change was strongly associated with cognitive deficits and not with depression or anxiety. This suggests that many people who changed occupation in the months and years after COVID-19 did so because they could no longer meet the cognitive demands of their job rather than for lack of energy, interest, or confidence.", "label": 1}

The highest-level character I've ever had in *Skyrim* is a female Breton, for much the same reason that I gravitated towards a gnome in *World of Warcraft*. Neither of these are specifically \"I want to play as a hyper-sexy woman\", but they do militate towards female-coded characters even when I have the option otherwise; I'm currently playing a female elf in *Baldur's Gate 3* more or less because I've gotten so used to female avatars in games.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Saying that there is no known correct level isn't exactly true. We can tell when an increase of a neurotransmitter fixes something, meaning that psychiatric condition's symptom's mechanism at least in part involves that neurotransmitter, specifically a deficit of it if we increase that NT. This in no way means that people aren't unknowingly affected by multiple things which can cause an alteration of neurotransmitter levels to seem ineffective on another person, either. It makes this extremely difficult to figure out, because it's nearly impossible to account for hidden variables when we have to guess in the first place what someone is affected by due to the amount of variables involved with brains, and our lack of understanding of physical causes. So many conditions involve the same symptoms as another.\n\nIn the case of ADHD, a different brain structure causing dopamine to *effectively* be at a \"low level\" in regards to average function(potentially due to reduced effectiveness of the dopamine/norepinephrine itself, or reduced transmission) is still an imbalance in neurotransmitters. Just because the *root cause* of ADHD is likely due to a difference in physical structure, that doesn't mean that the mechanism through which deficits occur isn't an imbalance regarding dopamine/norepinephrine. A negative change in how the affected structure is formed will change how much of those neurotransmitters are required in order to achieve a \"normal\" result of function. It's clear that adjusting this has a positive impact on the vast majority of people with ADHD. \n\nADHD is a rather clear example of a lack of neurotransmitters being the mechanism for a reduction in function within the systems involved.\n\n\nRegarding your other comment about chemical imbalance, pretending that a finding in one area regarding one specific symptom being applicable to anything involving neurotransmitters, is nonsense. Finding out that depression(a symptom of nearly endless psychiatric disorders) isn't only due to a serotonin imbalance means absolutely nothing.\n\nAmphetamines also don't cause a \"dump of reserves\", they increase transmission activity and inhibit reuptake in order to improve effectiveness and keep dopamine in the system longer.\nThis results in measurably higher levels and increased cognitive function.\n\nYou really seem like you read some headlines here and there and then regurgitated them without actually thinking about it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Sociology has made testable predictions in many different experimental and statistical contexts. It's not a \"hard\" science (eg. Physics, chemistry) but it uses scientific methodology. I know scientists often joke about the \"soft\" sciences, but calling sociology pseudoscience is simply incorrect.\n\nI don't think you have any real criticism of the methodology used in sociological publications. I think you just don't like the conclusions that all measurements point towards - that being a critique of hierarchical systems as they repeatedly show that they are harmful to all of their participants, even those in privileged positions. Sociology often makes apparent the contradictions inherent to the way people see themselves and each other, and this study is a great example of that among women who believe (or at least say) that all women should be subservient to men (negative sexism).\n\nThe terminology used is not the result of an ideological or moral framework.

{"text": "For those curious (and yes women can perpetuate it). There's a reason higher religiosity has more of this and explains a large aspect of why they would have voted for Trump. \n\nA woman can participate in hostile sexism by endorsing or expressing negative stereotypes, beliefs, or actions that devalue women and reinforce traditional, patriarchal norms. This can manifest in several ways:\n\n1. Internalized Misogyny: A woman might believe and spread the idea that women are inherently less capable or competent in certain areas, like leadership or complex problem-solving. She might openly criticize or belittle other women who defy traditional gender roles or succeed in male-dominated fields, reinforcing the belief that women should \u201cstay in their place.\u201d\n\n\n2. Policing Other Women\u2019s Behavior: A woman can participate in hostile sexism by shaming or criticizing other women for not adhering to traditional femininity or roles. For instance, she may disparage women who are assertive, ambitious, or sexually liberated, suggesting that they are \u201cunfeminine\u201d or morally lacking.\n\n\n3. Perpetuating Gender Stereotypes: By endorsing and spreading stereotypes that present women as manipulative, overly emotional, or inherently competitive with each other, she may reinforce hostile attitudes. For example, suggesting that women are always \u201cout to get each other\u201d or that they can\u2019t work together productively supports a narrative of distrust and division among women.\n\n\n4. Supporting Policies or Norms that Limit Women: A woman might support social, professional, or political policies that restrict women\u2019s opportunities. For example, she might advocate for traditional family roles that limit women's access to higher education or career advancement, arguing that it\u2019s not \u201cnatural\u201d or appropriate for women to pursue certain roles or ambitions.\n\n\n5. Undermining Feminist Movements: A woman can express hostile sexism by opposing or ridiculing feminist efforts for gender equality, labeling them as unnecessary, overly aggressive, or detrimental. This might involve claiming that sexism doesn\u2019t exist, that \u201cwomen have it easy,\u201d or that feminist activism is inherently \u201canti-male\u201d and should be opposed.", "label": 1}

Or women who don't think that's the way things should be but are in \"the other side\", vote for trump?\n\nFor example, I could absolutely see a conservative woman saying that \"*democrat women* seek to gain power by getting control over men\" while thinking that conservative women manage to gain power as equals to men in their own way without needing to directly control men.\n\nConservative women often think of themselves as women whose fathers taught them how to hunt, change their own engine oil, farm with the tractor, etc. They are in male dominated spaces holding their own and dont subscribe to a victimhood mentality. This may be especially true for latina women.

I found a common nutrients they are all good sources of is magnesium. \n\nFolicular: Then I started to notice the foods I craved at other points in my cycle. Immediately after my period I am craving beetroot and meat. Foods high in iron. \n\nThen around ovulation, my appetite changes and I don't feel overly hungry for food but I obviously still have to eat, so I found i was eating food with high water content: melons, cucumber, tomato, bone broth, eggs, walnuts and sweet potato. I like salty snacks, like Serrano Ham at this time. \n\nThen back to luteal. \n\nWhen I looked into the common nutrients the foods I craved from each week had, and I found common ingredients in all of them: luteal foods were high in magnesium and also aided digestion. Follicular were high in iron and protein. Ovulation was high in vit c and other vitamins, water, but needed salty foods to help with electrolytes, and funnily enough, sweet potato actually can lead to hyperovulation (and potentially for fraternal twins if eaten in high quantities).\n\n\nNow on top of this, I am very onto fitness, so I have a high protein, high fats and the carbs I eat come from fruit/veggies, and I only eat eggs and rarely will have cheese (it's a treat for me).

{"text": "I think you are missing part of the problem. Yes some men are geuninely upset they aren't going to be getting a maid, they shouldn't be paid attention to, however a lot of men have needs that they very reasonably can expect to be met by a partner.  \n\nPart of the problem is social shifts have in many ways emancipated women from their need for men. A shift men never experienced in kind, because our needs tend to be more personal and intimate. Women have effectively found alternative goods, a feat which men can't currently replicate for themselves. So the dynamic has swung wildly in favour of one gender.\n\nYou can even see it in how you phrase the issue \n\n>Some guys have seen the new reality and decided that they need to improve themselves to make themselves more appealing as a partner.\n\nWhich effectively is just saying you have to provide more for a female partner to actually make it worth while for them to be your partner. A man has to create more value than the alternative, which could be another man, or simply not having a man at all. \n\nThe problem for men becomes 2 fold. \n\n1. There is an upper limit to how much a man can \"reasonably\" improve. \n2. The ability to discriminate when selecting a partner does not have to be exercised rationally or with their interests in mind. A woman can select any partner for any reason. Which while it is, and should remain, a fundamental right, doesn't mean its always used fairly or well. \n\nSo men have to work hard to have their reasonable human needs met. In some contexts that is a good thing. More men should participate in shared labour, help with child care, be general respectful etc. However the other side is that unreasonable and unrealistic expectations have become more common. A lot of men will bring up things like 6/6/6 meaning 6 feet, 6 figures, 6 inches, which in my opinion isn't as prevalent as some men would make it out to be. However I do believe other expectations have begun to arise that men are genuinely struggling with. \n\nI'm not saying we can or even should go back to how things were. What I'm saying is there is a middle ground between \"self improvment\" so you deserve a partner and \"all women should be subservient to men\" which most men occupy. I think men can also genuinely be upset about struggling to meet their needs without having to immediately put into one of those camps or being hostile to women in general.", "label": 1}

{"text": "In chemistry \"variant\" really means very little. \n\nI mean it's like being afraid of apple juice because of vodka. Sure they both have alcohol in them but it's massively different. Except even more so, because not only are they different amounts (the amount of meth a general user would take vs the amount in mg of adderall)  but they're straight up different chemicals \"variant\" or not. \n\nYou could say that meth is a variant of dopamine. Ergo dopamine is scary. But that's clearly not true, you need dopamine to live (look at parkinsons). The only reason meth does what it does is because it's a \"variant\" of dopamine - it really doesn't mean anything.\n\nPerhaps a more apt example would be codeine and heroin? But then again, even codeine and heroin are more similar to each other than meth and adderall are! As crazy as it sounds, by the time either of them get to your brain they are the same molecule. However I admit that doesn't make much of a difference.\n\nLike heroin, meth is just a modified version of another drug (morphine for heroin, amphetamine for meth) which passes the blood brain barrier a lot quicker. Codine is metabolised into morphine, which means it crosses the barrier quite slowly in comparison.\n\nSo comparing codeine or morphine to amphetamine in this case is the most apt. Anybody can tell you there is a damning difference between them and their counterparts. Obviously I'm not saying that codeine and amphetamine have the same abuse potential. But I am trying to say these two things:\n\n- The fact that they are 'variants' makes a hell of a lot more difference than you think.\n\n- If you take them properly, it's unlikely to get addicted. Codeine is OTC despite as I said, it being exactly the same as heroin by the time it's in your brain. But anyone could tell you codeine isn't as addictive as morphine isn't as addictive as heroin. And it's all due to those 'variations'.\n\ntl;dr you shouldn't really consider what things are variations of what when you're considering taking them. That's a pharmacologists job. All biological molecules are variations of each other anyway - it's the whole reason they work. They _have_ to be variations of each other in order to fit in your receptors.", "label": 1}

I was stigmatized, made fun of by students, teachers would regularly ask me if I had \"taken my meds\" publicly so I quit taking them because I figured it'd be fine once I got older.\n\nA lot has changed since then. I now know that I have ADHD-C, that I will never grow out of it, that girls CAN get it, plus a plethora of other things.

Maybe half of those people will see a positive diagnosis for ADHD. \n\nI'm all for more understanding when it comes to ADHD. I do want younger generations to be informed and treated properly.

{"text": "But do you actually have ADHD, or are you gifted? Or both?\n\nA couple of years ago I was coached by the foremost researchers into giftedness and therapists for the gifted in Europe. The people who write the books.\n\nOne of the many things they told me (and I assume due to the above they know what they're talking about, I just hope I'm repeating it right) is that an incredible amount of gifted children are misdiagnosed with ADHD and vice versa. There is a large overlap in outward symptoms (with autism as well) and nobody fits any of the boxes precisely as all our brains are different; and to make it more complicated you can have all three. It can be very difficult to diagnose the difference, even though there are signs for each.\n\nA gifted child (non-ADHD), if caught early enough, can often be trained out of their ADHD-like symptoms. The cause for their problems is understimulation in certain aspects of learning in school, so that part of the brain is underdeveloped, and they are constantly bored and restless. They don't \"learn to learn\" in the early age normal school system (because they don't have to) and thus often crash out of education when their brains can't *intuitively* solve the problems anymore in their late teens. Most gifted never finish any more than high school (if even) due to this.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to retrain the adult brain to overcome this (which is also why this group simply doesn't really treat adults beyond basic coaching, their limited resources are better spent on the children), and left untrained the result (though not necessarily the original cause) is very close to ADHD, hence re-diagnosing. This doesn't mean you weren't (or were) a gifted child, though.\n\nSadly, at least in my part of Europe, it's really only been the last 10-15 years that serious time and research has gone into this, programs developed, etc, and the children are looked at more in-depth than the first quick diagnosis just being a slap of a gifted or ADHD label.", "label": 1}

Additionally, given the for-profit nature of healthcare in the US, some doctors may give a diagnosis based on the parents' wishes (or demands) even if the patient otherwise wouldn't quite meet the criteria. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, given that one of the main requirements for a clinical diagnosis is that you have to be impaired, that means that those who either have high raw cognitive ability or have otherwise learned to compensate for the inherent issues coming from their ADHD will not get flagged even if they have all the other hallmark symptoms.\n\nSo, in summary, I'm not exactly sure what your message has to do with anything I said earlier.

It's devastating having this condition and living in this type of family.\u00a0\n\n\nI struggled hard in school.

One of them in particular, you'd think we were twins, it's uncanny and that one was diagnosed with autism. Now imagine how it felt to find out that all the things I once thought were unique about me and made me different were actually just autistic symptoms with a dash of ADD. Just a big walking bag of symptoms. I brought this up to my therapist and she agreed and said she had suspected, but doesn't bring it up to adults - which infuriated me.\u00a0\n\n\nBut getting diagnosed changed my life. I'm no longer feeling like I can't learn while always learning. It changed my perspective and gave me a reason not to be hard on myself when I struggle. It's given me the knowledge to identify my symptoms from myself and think more about how I'm presenting myself to the world. And while I still make plenty of mistakes I have definitely gone from feeling cringe about the interaction to just being like...oh well, try again next time. And the thing that I enjoy doing the most now is something really silly - identifying my superpowers.\u00a0\n\n\nI have a decent sized list of abilities I have that not many other people I've ever met had.

She did very well still academically but had severe depression all through, breakdowns, lots of therapy, we almost lost her.

It's very easy to rationalize, \"Of course I'm more motivated when I'm interested in something.\"\n\nAnd that kind of underscores why clinicians need to _turn to the diagnostic criteria_ rather than rest on assumptions and stereotypes.
