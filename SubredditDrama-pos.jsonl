{"text": "[Some whales here](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/polymarket-trump-odds-election-betting-vibes.html) say yes.\n\nTo sum up: \n\n* Election betting has gained prominence in 2024, with many media outlets using odds from betting markets like Polymarket to gauge election outcomes, treating them alongside traditional polls and election models.\n* Polymarket\u2019s bet volume for the 2024 election has skyrocketed, nearing $2.5 billion, with Trump currently favored at 66%. This figure is notably higher than poll-based models but close to other betting markets. Skepticism surrounds the accuracy of these markets due to the potential biases of bettors on crypto-based platforms and the influence of large bets (\"whales\") with unknown motivations. Concerns also include market distortions from polls and press data. Prediction markets like Polymarket argue that because participants have financial stakes, they strive to consider all available data, acting objectively to increase accuracy, in theory making these markets more reliable than punditry alone.\n* Competitor Kalshi, recently US-regulated, claims betting forces refinement of opinions and sharpens understanding, aligning with economist Robin Hanson\u2019s theories that financially incentivized predictions yield clearer, more informed perspectives. Although prediction markets can often effectively aggregate probabilities, the comment sections on Polymarket reveal a chaotic, emotionally charged environment.\n* Bettors discuss political views, hurl insults, and sometimes engage in crude exchanges, suggesting motivations beyond rational analysis. Commenters on Polymarket\u2019s election-related bets show diverse personas, from intense pro-Trump or pro-Harris supporters to trolls and crypto enthusiasts. Some wield large bets as personal statements rather than data-driven predictions. A distinct lack of civility characterizes many comments, reflecting typical online comment section behavior more than objective or analytical discourse. A vocal few exhibit exaggerated confidence or fanatical support rather than measured data-driven reasoning.\n* Polymarket\u2019s mix of comments indicates that even those with financial stakes are not always rational, often driven by social, emotional, or political biases rather than purely analytical thinking. The prevalence of impulsive, vibe-based reasoning in prediction markets parallels voters\u2019 behavior, suggesting these markets might collectively miss key insights in a different way than polls, yet still shape betting behavior for future elections.\n* Overall, prediction markets might indeed reflect aggregated probabilities, but they also reveal a reliance on sentiment (\"vibes\") that brings a speculative unpredictable element to the process, potentially making them only partially reflective of likely outcomes. For participants, betting offers not only financial rewards but also the satisfaction of publicly proving opponents wrong, providing a distinct form of validation beyond just monetary gain.", "label": 1}

Which isn't surprising, it's just sad. Equally sad when they try and pretend otherwise, despite the fact that we can look into your subreddit and see more mention of Hasan than either harris or threads about voting for her posted there.
