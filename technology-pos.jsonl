{"text": "I had chat gpt try giving me all of the dialogue from the WKUK abraham lincoln sketch and it literally made up the whole thing. I had to call it out on lying. \n\n     The \u201cWhitest Kids U\u2019 Know\u201d Abraham Lincoln skit is a popular comedy sketch that humorously portrays an exaggerated and fictionalized version of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination at Ford\u2019s Theatre. The script includes some aggressive and absurd dialogue, blending historical context with a modern sense of humor. Here\u2019s a rough outline of the dialogue for that particular skit:\n\nSetting: Ford\u2019s Theatre, Lincoln is watching a play, and John Wilkes Booth is preparing to assassinate him. However, in this parody, Lincoln is portrayed as being loud, obnoxious, and confrontational, which leads to a very different assassination scenario.\n\nAbraham Lincoln: (Yelling loudly at the stage, disrupting the play)\n\u201cHey! Hey! What the hell is this? This play sucks! I could write a better play in my sleep!\u201d\n\nTheatergoers: (Shushing him) \u201cShhhhhh!\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: \u201cShut up! I\u2019m the president! I can do whatever I want! You suck!\u201d\n\nMary Todd Lincoln: \u201cAbe, calm down!\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down! This play is garbage!\u201d\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth: (Sneaking up behind him with a gun, whispers to himself) \u201cSic semper tyrannis.\u201d (Approaches Lincoln)\n\nAbraham Lincoln: (Noticing Booth) \u201cOh, great, what do you want?\u201d\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth: \u201cI\u2019m going to assassinate you.\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: (Standing up, confrontational) \u201cOh, you think you\u2019re gonna assassinate me? Why don\u2019t you sit your [bleep] down, John?!\u201d\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth: \u201cI\u2019m not sitting down, Mr. President. I\u2019m here to free the South from tyranny!\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: \u201cTyranny? You wouldn\u2019t know tyranny if it bit you in the [bleep]!\u201d\n\n(They start bickering loudly in a comical, over-the-top fashion.)\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth: (Getting frustrated) \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the good of the country!\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what the country is! You\u2019re an actor! Why don\u2019t you go cry about it in your dressing room?\u201d\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth: (Getting angrier, yelling back) \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t kill time, John! Sit down!\u201d\n\n(The argument escalates as Lincoln taunts Booth more, leading to Lincoln mocking him for several things, with the scene ultimately ending in an exaggerated comedic version of the assassination.)\n\nThe skit is meant to be absurd and a clear parody of history, where Lincoln is intentionally portrayed in an extremely out-of-character, loud, and obnoxious way to create humor. The sketch\u2019s humor comes from the juxtaposition of historical figures in modern-day attitudes and absurd interactions.", "label": 1}

There\u2019s an inherent temperature gradient from hot to cold of any heat source. Extracting energy along that flow does not \u201cuse up\u201d the heat. That would be like saying dams \u201cuse up\u201d the water by having it push a generator down hill. For a dam\u2019s purpose gravitational potential energy is where the energy is being extracted from. For a geothermal source it is the temperature gradient. Extracting energy from the gradient doesn\u2019t make the source cool off faster.\n\nSure, we would be limited in that the maximum we could ever generate is based off the total heat flow. Nothing is ever truly limited, but it wouldn\u2019t cause it to run out of heat. Just like the limit for what we could produce from a river depends on the gravitational potential energy gradient of the water. Essentially k*delta(T) vs m*delta(h) up to the efficiency limits of the methods we can extract with.", "label": 1}

{"text": "In response to your @, idk why you wouldn\u2019t be able to reply either. But you\u2019re really just exemplifying your misunderstanding of thermal energy. Yes the main core will forever cool. It will do that regardless of if we extract the energy in the process. Just like a river will always flow down, us putting in a dam to harvest the energy doesn\u2019t change the fact that it will still eventually flow down and no it isn\u2019t going to flow any faster.\n\nIf the earth were going to take 1,000,000 years to cool (it will take far far more than that) it will still take 1,000,000 years while we\u2019re harvesting energy. Just like the sun is going to radiate solar energy until it burns out, us putting up solar panels isn\u2019t going to drain the sun of its energy faster, we\u2019re just taking advantage of the energy already being emitted. \n\nVery very slowly, as the earth eventually cools down, our generators will be less and less efficient because the temperature gradient gets smaller. Again, this will happen anyways and our interaction physically does not affect this. It\u2019s not about it even being minuscule, that\u2019s just not how physics works here. This process will also take far longer than this planet is even going to be livable.\n\nWe might have a fixed amount we can actually generate from the earth, simply because there\u2019s only so much energy being radiated at a time from earths heat, but that is the only limiting factor. We are not capable of having an effect on this process.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Expanding. Working in senior manufacturing sales, my income is deeply tied to sales commissions. When tariffs increase, so do the costs for the products I sell, which means my commissions take a hit if I have to raise prices because customers order less. Under Trump\u2019s administration, tariffs rose by 25% on basic materials, and Biden didn\u2019t remove them\u2014so these tariffs remain. The truth is, American importers pay these tariffs, not the foreign countries. It affects the cost of materials like rubber, corrugated, bottles, and wood, which has been climbing, and that gets passed on to consumers.\n\nAs an example, we don\u2019t have alternatives here in the U.S. for things like shoes, as there\u2019s no significant manufacturing base for them domestically because of consumer demand for brands like Nike and Adidas.\n\nThis tariff impact isn\u2019t just about rubber or shoes\u2014it\u2019s felt across grocery store shelves, especially in packaging costs. Prices fell slightly in September and October, but that\u2019s largely because annual contracts are renegotiated then, and grocers have been pushing hard for lower prices while maintaining their high markups. The constant pressure on manufacturers to absorb these costs, while prices continue to climb for everyone, is beyond frustrating.\n\nSo, if we want prices to drop, tariffs are a factor we need to address. They\u2019re just another burden on American businesses and consumers that keeps driving up everyday costs.", "label": 1}

That was a major sticking point of the 2000 Camp David Accords. Israel rejected a reduced right of return for Palestinians outright.

It can only pick two. Annexing the territories and their populations makes Israel majority Arab, which means the Jewish nature of the state is lost if they remain democratic.
