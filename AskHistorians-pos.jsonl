The Amazonian terra preta was designed not just to improve soil, but to maintain itself through very heavy rainfall. Mixing in pottery shards and other solid debris in particular seems like an important innovation. I haven't heard of European terra preta lingering thousands of years with no maintenance or the self-regenerating property. Let me know if you find any articles on this though!\n\nI am interested in how provable my answer above is, given the urbanization and industrialization of England, Sweden and Rome since. It's possible they had larger extents of suboptimal farming land made possible with terra preta like techniques, but were subsequently swallowed by the expanding urban cores and so the evidence has been lost. Certainly the idea of fertilizing soil with biowaste and charcoal is not unique to south America. One of the links also notes that some Amazonian terra preta was likely accidental, rather than a planned effect. That said, the specific layering and mixture of most extant Amazonian terra preta is very unlikely to be accidental.\n\nThe simplest explanation is just that Europeans didn't *need* to develop these techniques. Even Sweden and England have plenty of arable land, to say nothing of the breadbasket of Italy. The problems they faced weren't constant downpours washing out nutrients, but seasonality making it impossible to grow food half the year. The same article *also* mentions a similar technique applied in the jungle of western Africa. This suggests it may have been an innovation discovered independently by multiple rainforest-dwelling groups around the world, not just South America. Probably stemming from the universal practice of fertilizing farmland 'accidentally', then refined through careful observation and improvement, driven by sheer necessity.", "label": 1}

That's the most compelling counter-argument to me, and the hardest to rebut. I still disagree, but I have to migrate to 'philosophy of technology' here. What counts as a unique technological invention, versus a tiny change to an existing invention? If two isolated societies both develop spears independently, and one of them exclusively uses spears for big game hunting while the other uses it exclusively for fishing, does the *usage* of spears in different contexts count? If one tribe in the Amazon develops green dyes for camouflaged clothing, and a tribe in Northern Alaska develops white dyes for camouflaged clothing in *their* environment, are those seperate achievements or the same achievement? What if white dyes occur naturally while the green dye requires its own manufacturing chain? \n\nSaying that \"Europeans didn't live in the Amazon\" is obviously true; but to me, we can't just 'handicap' cultures because they were in regions not suited to the technology. What matters is that the technology *was* developed. The Aztec lacked a domesticated animal larger than a dog, so it's 'not fair' that they didn't develop stirrups. But the fact still remains - they *didn't* develop stirrups. They barely invented wheels! Same argument here.

Ancient learning also continued in the Byzantine empire (the EasternRoman Empire) the Muslim world, etc.\n\nLearning declined in the west following economic collapse and \"barbarian\" incursion. It's not actually correct that they had access to the same records  - remember that before printing a book only existed in the hand copied copies. Books were rare, expensive items, and a lot of material simply disappeared. Sophocles wrote many more plays than we have, but in most cases no one copied them at the right point.  This problem isn't peculiar to Europe. In China, despite a  continuous tradition of advanced culture, the crucial ancient philosophical text the Mozi only just survived to modern times in a very few copies, because it was out of fashion and no one happened to feel like putting all that work into copying a book no one seemed to be interested in.\n\nThe western society had lost access to a huge amount of writing.  In some cases the books existed elsewhere, in Byzantium or the Muslim world, in other cases they were lost. It had lost knowledge of Greek for the most part. It only had imperfect amounts of translated material. Plato was represented much more than Aristotle, in particular. Only later did Aristotle reach them, in Arabic translation, from the Muslim world.\n\nThere was further recovery of classical writing at the Renaissance. \n\nTechnology  - in western Europe, most Roman technology was no longer of much use. Why build huge aqueducts to supply cities if the economy doesn't support big cities now? The Byzantine Empire preserved much more. But the west began to start creating new technology that was of use to it, and this actually proved more valuable.  Roman technology is impressive but was partly based in the needs of a large, military state. Improved ploughs which enabled settlement of northern Europe are less exciting but have huge historical impact. The Roman's had beautiful glasswork, but spectacles are a medieval invention. The ancient world apparently did have clockwork but it was very rare, whereas in Europe it became commonplace after its reinvention. The windmill is a medieval invention,  possibly inspired by the earlier Persian windmill which works on a different principle. \n\nThe point is that thinking of there being a simple loss and recovery of technology is too simple.

In the 1930s, an average German family not working in agriculture spent almost 50 percent of their income on food, while only 10 to 15 percent on rent. However, store-bought chicken sandwiches were not a big part of the diet\u2014instead most Germans subsisted on a monotonous diet of cheaper starches such as bread and potatoes with only small amounts of meat, dairy, and alcohol. When rationing was introduced during World War II, many Germans with lower than average incomes (as well as poorer Britons, and eventually poorer Americans) actually saw their diets and nutrition improve as a result of the non-market-based ration system which granted them more nutritious food than they had been able to afford previously.\n\nHowever, in terms of your question spending an hour of income on a meal would seem quite reasonable if you are spending overall 50 percent of your income on food. Also, people in these times did not have as much space as many people do today. Although it wasn't uncommon for American factory workers to be able to afford four bedroom apartments for their family, most Germans were living out of two or less rooms meaning they would not have had much in the way of kitchen, dining, and living space. Even now, for people living in expensive urban areas, it can cost more to rent the space to cook versus eating ready meals or fast food.

{"text": "On a general note, it's important to recognize that technology doesn't exist outside of a cultural context, so technological advancement doesn't necessarily mean \"most shiny moving parts\"; it needs to be couched in a context of effectiveness within a specific suite of technical, economic and social behaviours. For example, a steam locomotive is utterly useless in Kiribati, but you could argue that on a purely material level it's more \"advanced\" than a double-hull canoe. You need the right tool for the right job. To that extent, it's vital to understand how each society defines the job itself. Peter Bleed has a great paper on technological decision making and design theory based on ecologically and culturally informed task parameters: \"The Optimal Design of Hunting Weapons: Maintainability or Reliability\" (1986). Tim Ingold also has a classic about the recursive relationship between technology and culture: \"Culture on the Ground: The World Perceived Through the Feet\" (2004). He discusses how one's familiar technological interface structures one's perspectives of the world, and thus practices, behaviours, and attitudes beyond that specific technologically mediated activity. One of my favourites.\n\n\n\nThat said, on a purely head to head comparative basis, both the canoe (Eastern Woodlands) and the kayak (Inuit) kick the living snot out of any small boat coming out of Europe. A skin on frame kayak is still superior to every fiberglass, plastic, or Kevlar imitator. (\"Then why isn't skin on frame the popular kayak product now?\" Because it can't be mass produced and you have to maintain it properly.)  There are a dozen different ways to make a warm, efficient, smoke-free fire, all of which seem to originate from the Americas. Pithouses (semi-subterrainean sod-roofed homes, common to the Indigenous people of the Intermontane West) are cool in the summer and warm in the winter, without AC.  We see people starting to go back in that direction with rammed earth homes and green roofs.  The three sisters agriculture method uses complementary crops to boost yields while simultaneously replenishing nitrogen in the soil without requiring fallowing.  Culturally prescribed burning maintained healthy and productive forests for millennia (these massive landscape-scale fires we see here in the west now are quite new). Let's just call \"forest management\" its own thing. And if you want to extend your group criteria to include Indigenous people of the South Pacific, their understanding of currents, winds, and ocean navigation make Cook look like a kid splashing in a bathtub.

Which has several levels and rights.\n\nAchieving citizenship you end up a Plebian as to be a Patrician you have to be born into it. \n\nWhat you can achieve is a higher ORDO based on property and wealth.\n\nThe highest you can achieve here is a Class1 (meaning you own property worth 100.000 asserius) Equestrian (armed Horsemen)\n\nThis will give you 98 Votes in the Centurian assembly.\n\nSince its the 2nd century bc you might to marry a Patrician which would give you the opportunity to live an even higher livestyle by using the Clientela system.\n\n However having achived both of these your next goal would be to become part of the senate and going from there gain public offices wich all where connectet to ridiculous wealth.\n\n\n\nFor the Question on the Middle Ages.\n\nThe middle ages are a long time. almost 1000 Years. so lets pick a prominent Timeframe.\n\nYou are a young Trader in the City of Hamburg in 1375.\n\nYou are already far ahead of the feudal Farmers outside the city walls as you have learned a trade, joined a guild, became a citizen of Hamburg and now used your saved up money to open tradehouse in the Kontor (a kind of freetrade zone in the Hanseatic citys.)\n\nAt this point you are a Glorified Storagekeeper. You might be buying Salt and Wine and Beer from Trader coming up the roads who coudnt find captains to sell to directly to later sell them at a higher price once such captains arrived later and buy from such captains at your own risk that the goods you buy might never sell.\n\nBut your luck is good and keeps up. You end up gaining enough wealth to trade in spices and buy your own ships. posibly even send those ships to the mediterainian to buy the Spices from the markets there. Especially pepper wich the royals outside the city use to spice there wine.\n\nYou are now called a Peppersack (pfeffersack) at least in Hamburg. You are a Fabulously wealthy Trader who, being a citizen of the city already has a number of rights.\n\nThere are now two paths in politics you can take.\n\nBecome a City council member. Or become an Alderman of Your Kontor with the aim of influencing the Hanse trade as a whole. Both are elected positions.\n\n\n\nSo to answer you first question:\n\nSuccess in Rome was measured in landownership and political power.\n\nSuccess in the late middle ages as a merchant was measured in the rarety of your goods, your wealth in currency, prestige and political power.\n\n  \nSecond question: \n\nWhile both situations had rather rigid class systems with little opportunities of social climbing in the given two example there where at least some.\n\n  \nThird Question:\n\nRags to riches stories always exist. Often even fictional ones as these stories and myths always show up together with opportunity.\n\nFor the Hanse there are definitely real ones.\n\nFor rome i am unsure if there ever was someone who made it from non-citizen to Senator in a livetime.", "label": 1}

I'll leave the specifics of research methodology, ethics, citation, etc., to other more experienced heads in the AH community, but some of tips include:\n\n- Conduct interviews with diverse and representative voices. Try to find people from different backgrounds, staff positions, social groups, etc., Document information about them where appropriate and relevant to your research.\n- Ask questions on a wide range of topics. Allow your subjects to speak. \n- Ensure each participant is asked the same questions so you can compare responses, especially if you're looking for information about a specific period or event.\n- Verify the orial accounts of your subjects against written/verifiable secondary sources wherever possible.\n- Cite your sources where appropriate and necessary so your readers can include their own assessment of the source material.\n- Ask your interviewees for access to more primary written material \n- Make sure you are conducting your research in an ethical manner. I believe the AH FAQ has sources on the topic, if not hopefully somebody else can help you out in more detail.\n- Ensure you have a thorough, neat and stylistically consistent bibliography. Create, maintain and publish a detailed list of your sources by type in alphabetical order. For this specific topic you may want to include the attendee years of former students and staff.\n\nOkay, hopefully this gets you started.

{"text": "One of the main reasons Hernando de Soto\u2019s expedition was difficult for Native Americans to defeat was the advanced military technology and tactics employed by the Spaniards. I mean, first and foremost, just think about it: De Soto\u2019s men were equipped with steel weapons, armor, and firearms, which were far superior to the wooden or stone weapons used by most Native American tribes at that time. Add on to that the  psychological impact of gunpowder weapons, such as arquebuses and cannons, surely also played a significant role in intimidating indigenous forces. The combination of these technological advantages allowed De Soto\u2019s troops to engage effectively in battles against numerically superior foes.\n\nThe soldiers accompanying De Soto were often seasoned veterans from previous conquests in Central America. Their combat experience gave them an edge in battle strategies and formations that were not familiar to many Native American warriors. This military discipline allowed them to maintain cohesion during engagements, making it harder for indigenous forces to exploit their numerical superiority.\n\nAnother critical factor was the introduction of European diseases, such as smallpox, influenza, and measles, which decimated Native American populations long before they could mount effective resistance against European incursions. It can\u2019t be underestimated how dangerous these were.  These diseases spread rapidly among indigenous communities who had no prior exposure or immunity, leading to significant population declines that weakened their ability to organize large-scale resistance against De Soto\u2019s expedition.\n\nNow what every armchair war historian must mention:  strategy and logistics. De Soto\u2019s expedition was characterized by its mobility; they traveled extensively through what is now the southeastern United States (including parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana). This mobility allowed them to evade larger groups of hostile natives while also conducting raids on villages for supplies. The Spanish were able to move quickly between locations due to their horses\u2014another advantage over many Native American tribes who primarily relied on foot travel.\n\nOn top of that, De Soto demonstrated bleak  brutality\u2014through acts such as enslavement and violence\u2014he instilled total fear among local populations. Many tribes might have chosen not to confront De Soto directly due to fear of retribution or because they believed that resisting would lead to severe consequences for their communities.\n\nThere was also a lack of unified resistance among the tribes. Unlike other expeditions led by Cort\u00e9s or Pizarro that benefited from alliances with certain indigenous groups against others (such as the Aztecs or Incas), De Soto faced a fragmented landscape of tribes that often did not unite against him despite shared animosity towards his actions. The lack of a coordinated response made it easier for De Soto\u2019s smaller force to manage conflicts individually rather than facing a united front.\n\nFinally, supply lines or lack thereof required De Soto\u2019s expedition to be adept at resource acquisition through raiding and pillaging local villages for food and supplies when necessary. This turned out to be a very fruitful strategy that not only sustained his men but also further alienated local tribes who might have otherwise been neutral or even supportive if treated differently.", "label": 1}

It can\u2019t be underestimated how dangerous these were. These diseases spread rapidly among indigenous communities who had no prior exposure or immunity, leading to significant population declines that weakened their ability to organize large-scale resistance against De Soto\u2019s expedition.\n\nThis does not reflect the current scholarly consensus on disease spread after contact in the U.S. Southeast. Kelton found no evidence of massive depopulation either prior to the de Soto *entrada*, nor a change in mortuary practices or site abandonment coinciding with the *entrada*.

Sometimes they attribute these things to a secret (white) human civilisation, sometimes to aliens, either way the ideological effect is the same. In more recent work Jason explores the overlap between these theories/followers and Qanon and other branches of racist conspiracy thinking.\n\nManifestations of the same ideological ploy can be seen even before the current obsession with Aliens: for example, the early French explorers and colonisers of SE Asia claimed that Angkor Wat must have been constructed by a lost Roman colony; Mormon beliefs in an ancient white civilisation in North America; the lengths Rhodesia went to to deny that Great Zimbabwe was constructed by its subject peoples; Australian beliefs that so-called \u201cBradshaw\u201d art was not painted by Aboriginal people; the British Israelite claim that the British were the real lost tribes of Israel and hence Gods chosen people; etc. It\u2019s notable that these theorists never attribute prehistoric European artefacts, like Stonehenge, to ancient astronauts.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I suspect there are two long-running natratives that contribute to the popularity of this theory.  Hyperborean Atlantis, and the granddaddy of all modern conspiracy theories - the Bavarian Illuminati.\n\nTo start with the Illuminati. In 1776, a professor founded a secret society to promote his views of Enlightenment rationalism, republicanism, and eventually atheism. However, since this was extremely illegal in the kingdom of Bavaria, he set it up like a mystery cult, with only a very close circle aware of their true aims. The claim they made while recruiting was to be a 1000 year old, global order of mystics with leaders far above the professor who founded them. Everyone else recruited was inducted through mystic rites, led through fake alchemy, basically made to feel like wizards. This allowed the group to gather funds from unaware members to try and pursue their goals. Eventually, they were undone, and a large number of their papers and letters were entered into evidence against them. From these we get much of our knowledge of the group's workings, along with an account written by a disillusioned former senior member about his role in writing the mythology presented to the majority of Illuminati members. Papers at the time published a mixed mess of the mythology and the group's true aims based on what was most sensational - for instance, they mention the Illuminati's plans to overthrow all world governments, which was technically true since they were secretly republicans, alongside the magic stuff.\n\nHyperborean Atlantis was the result of a belief in the 1800s that all humanity descended from one source, that all myths contained secrets about that source society, and that all technological development was just rediscovering secrets from that lost society.\n\"Paradise Found: the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole\" by W. Warren was published in 1885, and located this mythical society at the North Pole (it's on Public Domain Review to read if you want a sense of the kinds of thinking involved). Pt.6 Chapter IV is particularly illuminating, if you can get around his incredibly flowery prose - he opposed the theory of evolution, and instead claimed man had \"devolved\".\n\nBoth the Illuminati's mythology and the interpretations of the Atlantis myth in the 19th century resonated strongly. There is, for whatever reason, something compelling about the idea of ancient knowledge, the truth of which is now lost to us. Warren implied the scientists of his day were hiding it though ignorance rather than deliberate action, while the Bavarian Illuminati stated they had been hiding themselves for a 1000 years to further their goals. These ideas seem to get picked up on repeatedly in art and literature. Indeed, they're likely linked to our tendency to romanticise history - such as our first written Arthurian myths, which projects an idealised version of Medieval chivalry back into a period that didn't share such ideals.\n\nThis isn't a complete answer, but some pieces I have picked up while looking at this issue and how compellingly popular it is. The \"conspiracy to conceal the truth\" seems newer (I don't recall it being present when such views were presented 20 years ago, although someone please comment if they have specifics!) and so is likely a reaction to criticisms of these enduringly popular narratives. It seems like a means of avoiding cognitive dissonance around believing in evidence/rationalism and also finding these stories deeply compelling for ultimately irrational reasons.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First a couple of disclaimers: I am no expert in medicinal history, I just have a little bit of knowledge when it comes to lobotomy, and more specifically lobotomy in Norway. Also, my time is somewhat limited, as I'm currently watching my 1 year old very very active son. Mods, feel free to ask for more sources or just remove this post if it's not up to this subs excellent standards.\n\n\nThe reason I know a little about lobotomy is that Norway lobotomized their fair share of patients. In fact when compared to its population, Norway lobotomized second most patients, only beaten by Denmark. When studying for my degree, I wrote a rather terrible paper on \"Lier Sykehus\" where a lot of the surgeries happened in Norway.\n\nSo first off, when talking about lobotomy as a method of treating mental illness, we really can't use modern times and modern treatment as a context. Mentally ill people did not get the same treatment, obviously, as they do in many modern countries. In many cases the mentally ill were treated as animals, chained up in a barn with little to no care. At least in Norway, the worst cases of mentally ill people were often put in \n\"colonies\" to work, or given to poor farmers as a mean of income. Needless to say, the farmers did not really know much or anything really about caring for mentally ill people. \n\nLobotomy itself was \"invented\" by an american physiologist named John Farquhar Fulton. He performed a frontal loboectomy on primates, and reported a change in their behaviour, making them less aggressive (which in apes and primates is quite remarkable). He is often quoted with: \"It was as though they had joined a happiness cult\". \n\nThe portuguese neurologist Antonio Muniz used Fultons findings and developed the prefrontal leucotomy, for which he got the nobel prize in physiology in 1949. He operated mainly on schizophrenic patients, and reported mostly positive results. \n\nIn the US, Freeman and Watts developed a much used standard for prefrontal lobotomy, and performed this surgery on thousands of different patients, including the famous case of Rosemary Kennedy. They reported back a success rate of over 60%, but also had a staggering mortality rate of just under 15%. Its worth noting that it was mainly used as a last resort. If a patient had exhausted all other options, lobotomy was an option. Sadly one of the reasons it got so popular was because Freeman himself talked very highly of the positives the surgery could bring, and did not focus on the negative sides. This caught on in the media, and in Scandinavia at least, lobotomy was seen as a breakthrough in mental illness on par with antibiotics in medicine. \n\n\nSo to briefly again answer your main questions:\n> Why did it stick around for so long when it (at least stereo-typically) turns people into vegetables? \n\nLack of other treatments and because Watts and Freeman was dishonest.\n\n> Were there any documented \"good lobotomies\", where the patient genuinely got better, even in isolated instances?\n\nWhile I would not go far as to call any surgeries \"good lobotomies\", there were certainly instances where very aggressive and severely mentally ill patients got less aggressive. The procedure reduced anxiety and aggression, but replaced it with apathy.\n\nsources:\n\nFreeman and Watts: Psychosurgery --- Which if read in this context is truly fascinating!\nOgren: Portrayals of lobotomy in American and scandinavian media.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Somewhat. But it is a hugely multifaceted question.\n\nThe (Western) European geopolitical structure following the collapse of the (Western) Roman Empire was peculiar in many ways, and increasingly so into the late middle ages and beyond. This was a geopolitical scene of regionalized states that outside of perhaps Iberia did not have drastically porous borders, remained under relatively stable states that did not predicate themselves on the survival of individual dynasties (See the transition from Carolingian rulers to local ones following the second and final breakup of the Carolingian Empire, in which at least West and East Frankia were largely preserved under their new dynasties), and thus for centuries remained politically seperate, independent entities which for much of the medieval period (and in the case of the HRE, beyond it) remained internally fractured and therefore even internally competitive.\n\nWhy does this matter? It sets PART OF (not all!) the stage for later early modern technological and even institutional developments within Europe that was not seen elsewhere. But it can at least explain the development of high to late medieval European military innovation: namely the advancement of fortifications (culminating in early bastion/star forts), the advancement of armor (culminating in bulletproofed, mass-produced munitions armor), and the development of firearms (culminating in arquebuses) by the 16th century can all be attributed to this fragmented state of affairs that was characterized by decentralized feudal societies above all, then their development into centralized states which coopted these advancements.\nBut notice that these are all explicitly of a martial nature, and that these were *not* the tools of imperialism that drove later European expansion. Certainly they were useful: but largely in relation to the early ventures of the Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nAnd even with these achievements, 'the West' was only just beginning to have any notable developmental advantage over 'the Rest' during the sixteenth century (but the dating for this is very arguable!).\nThis is then a question of the Great Divergence: describing, when, why, and how the West overtook the rest of the world developmentally. The answer to this question ranges anywhere from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries.\n\nBack to the geopolitical situation of Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe feudal states which had once been, by this point now largely coalesced into relatively strictly defined (not so much by modern standards, but nonetheless) states with far more centralized authorities than had been the case up to that point. The genesis and strongest example of this was France.\nThe geopolitical dichotomy had now coalesced into defined states, and this would come to define the European state of affairs for the remainder of history. Much like in the middle ages, few regions changed hands as much as those of the Near East, Central Asia, and South Asia. Yet the states themselves were now internally stable, although still beset by regular upheavals (Wars of Religion being a clear case). Nonetheless what this produced was a patchwork of large and centralized states that were in constant competition with one another: and it remained this way. It was not the (usually) deeply stable Chinese dynaties which could remain without true competition for centuries, nor was it constantly changing hands between gunpowder empires like West and South Asia. In a sense it was a perfect storm that was very particular to Europe.\nThis then set the stage for what Peer Vries in *State, Economy, and the Great Divergence* describes as the fiscal-military state: particularly in relation to Great Britain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but it can nonetheless be applied to at least the Atlantic powers of Europe. This was the predication of state revenue towards military ventures, and the predication of military ventures towards state revenue. This of course, involved colonialism.\n\nColonialism cannot be removed from the understanding of the Great Divergence. It was the driving factor of Western dominance from beginning to end, and while the long list of aforementioned conditions in Europe were also certainly quite important to its rise, colonialism and the wealth it generated was what 'supercharged' it, so-to-speak. This in turn began international mercantilism: something that would begin to have very big consequences within time.\n\nWar for resources by European powers became increasingly far-flung as the value of colonial gold was realized: this is seen even prior to the Thirty Years War, with the Spanish military being one heavily reliant on wealth acquired (stolen) from the New World. Such colonial wars escalated further and further into history and you eventually arrive at the decisive Seven Years War and the beginning of the nineteenth century.\nEuropean powers had by this point been under strenuous competition over centuries: they had stretched their respective tax capabilities to the maximum, had fought for their mercantile interests abroad, and relentlessly so. European wars against non-European powers abroad were not wholly unheard of, but even by this point were still decidedly difficult to actually win (as showcased by numerous difficulties in India), especially in the Old World. But this is the point where the balance of power is generally agreed to have begun to really shift in their favor.\n\nEurope did not necessarily fight the most wars. It was geopolitically deeply competitive yet not disastrously so, and the long-present drive for foreign luxuries drove that geopolitical situation to a world-spanning scale. This in turn vastly increased the flow of capital to said European states, thus improving the capability for war, thus improving the capability to acquire more capital...\n\nThe statement is somewhat correct in a sense, but on its own is rather false. War played an enormous role: but war alone is not the whole picture.", "label": 1}

{"text": "OP - I would offer that reframing your question might help get a more direct answer. Alternatively, if you consider the framework of your question, you might find out that you have a lot more questions that you had before! Here are some ways you might consider how the framework of your question might show how your question can provoke a variety of answers.\n\n1) do you think about European rapid advancement as something that occurs after the rush to colonize Africa, Asia, and the Americas? If that is your framework, then I would offer that it certainly helps that Europe was in an advantageous position, compared to global rivals, given that colonization extracts resources from a locality at the expense of local people to the benefit of the foreign power.\n\n2) which technologies and industries are you considering? Coke was widely used as fuel and necessary to the industries of the West that powered their rapid rise (look no further than the industrial cities settled along the Great Lakes in North America) - that was invented in China well before it found its way to European steelworks.\n\n3) your question reads to me that you considering Europe as having stayed at its own domestic interests within Europe. This is a point to challenge - neither war nor trade are local phenomena. The Eastern world was sending goods from the far east to far west of the greater continent, seeing a rise of many many powers. Consider that the Ottomans controlled a large part of this trade network, and they were in conflict with Europe and developed alongside them. Do the ottomans and later Turkey fit within your consideration of European technical dominance? Consider that there have been discoveries of treasures from the east (including a jade Buddha!) in viking graves. I bring that up because your question evokes images of the West developing tanks and planes. But let us consider the greatest military advancement in weaponry since the popularization of steel - gunpowder. An invention from the far east in China, later used by the Mongols, and in the thirteenth century it spreads through Asia, Europe and Africa, where gunpowder weapons are all advanced (and I daresay, some interesting weapons were invented in and out of Europe that you could consider to be rival technologies). If you look at gunpowder and weapons using it, I would say that it's advancement is a global phenomena that evolved using engineering talent from east, to west, to north and south.\n\nAll that to say, you may find that you have a very specific idea in mind, and may wish to ask a more specific question.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I would argue that while gains in some technologies did materialise in war setting, it was a fleeting advantage and not one that could have been projected over thousands of miles. China was likely ahead in terms of gunpowder units in the era of early European oversea expansion but the notable comparison is Japan. They had known gunpowder for years but when the Portuguese arrived with matchlock weaponry they quickly copied and likely outproduced and outperformed the Europeans in the technology in a period of decades, a very short time period. This make sense, if you can work with metal and have access to the raw materials gunpowder isn't complicated. The sort of fortifications that responded to gunpowder- lower, bigger- were also developed in Japan at the time. \n\nUltimately the tech that gave Europe, and particularly the western European states the edge in the relevant time period is shipping. Portuguese, Dutch, English and Brittany were all small states on the fringe of Europe in the 14/15th century. They had nowhere to go but the deep sea and were being heavily pressured by growing and fast dynastic entities forming into powerful blocs and centralised states. Hapsburgs were squeezing out their competition and increasingly could draw on state financing that their opponents simply couldn't. It's not a coincidence that all of this states found themselves in conflict with those states and either successfully held them off in the case of England, broke away in the case of the Dutch and Portuguese or were subsumed in the case of Brittany. The massive centralising states also gained from the oversea trading- the discovery of the new world was funded by Castile and Aragon, just over a decade after they were united but within a generation the grandson of the monarchs who funded Columbus ruled all of Iberia, the Netherlands, half of Italy, bohemia, Hungary, Austria as well as being the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe technology and knowledge (maps and charts were vital) needed to operate these ship based system grew over a large amount of time and became incredibly valuable. It was funded by and developed for trading purposes so there was a positive feedback loop. You buy a 1000 guns you either use them in a war or they rust but they don't provide a return on investment outside of that. Trading vessels generate income to produce the next generation of trading vessels and the knowledge and demand to improve on the designs. What was also very hard to copy was the training, the culture, required to maintain ocean-going ships for this time period. The death rate was atrocious, scurvy and malnutrition was rampant. The chances of failure were very high and very costly. \n\nAll of this could have been acquired by other powers with enough focus and investment- the barriers were just a lot higher, which is why you didn't see the quick technological transfers you saw with mass produced technology like gunpowder. So with a positive feedback loop those who made huge amounts of money from trading ships and the advantages they gave pumped than money back into trading ships and the advantage grew and the barrier to entry kept getting worse as the gap widened. This added to the material gains from the exploitation of the new world allowed the Europeans to project force more and more- from establishing fortified factories, to conquering small islands to establishing plantations for sugar islands, to taking over tax collection, to the end product of this widening gap in resources- the establishment of direct rule empires over parts of the world which had been technologically similar centuries before.\n\n\n\nA modern comparison would be companies like Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Google and the wider context of silicon valley. It had marginal advantages when it started, ones that theoretically could have been overcome but the advantages accrue and accrue and you can point at small incidences where theoretically a different direction could have been taken but mostly its just a matter of growth compounding. A guy in Silicon Valley can borrow money to start up a tech company easier and can find all the staff he needs to operate it, then when that companies successful and employs loads of tech staff it adds a little bit more weight to the equation for Silicon Valley vs elsewhere.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Mainly, there were no other alternatives for treating patients. Lobotomy was primarily used on individuals suffering from schizophrenia, epilepsy, and even depression. Its history is frustrating, as anyone experiencing depression, paranoia, or anxiety was subjected to lobotomy. The result was often that patients smiled and giggled excessively, like children, which was perceived as an improvement over their previous conditions.\n\nYes, there was another alternative, which was even worse. Because there were no therapeutic measures available at the time for quieting chronically agitated, delusional, or self-destructive patients, individuals in psychiatric wards were often subjected to physical violence, which was considered worse than a \"miracle\" prefrontal lobotomy.\n\nAlthough the use of lobotomy faced resistance and criticism in America, it gained attention due to American neurologists Freeman and Watts promoting and modifying the procedure from lobotomy to prefrontal lobotomy in 1936 through public media, labeling it as the miracle procedure for the hopeless. In 1945, Freeman further modified this procedure, naming it a transorbital lobotomy. This involved using a pick-like instrument forced through the back of the eye sockets to pierce the thin bone that separates the eye sockets from the frontal lobes.\n\nBecause this operation could be completed in a maximum of 10 minutes, it was used on many patients with relatively minor mental disorders that Freeman believed did not warrant traditional lobotomy surgery, which involved opening the skull. A large proportion of these lobotomized patients exhibited reduced tension or agitation. Because the procedure seemed to achieve widespread success, Moniz (the creator) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1949. However, its use declined in the 1950s and 60s with the advent of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and shock therapy.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The original purpose of lobotomies was not necessarily to restore a state of sanity, but rather to induce a state of calmness that made psychotic or difficult patients easier to deal with in the context of at home care or institutionalization. \n\nSome early research in how removing parts of the brain could affect behavior was done by German physiologist Friedrich Goltz, who experimented on dogs in 1881, demonstrating that motor function could be maintained without the parts of the cerebral cortex. \n\n\nOne of the earliest attempts at conducting a lobotomy on humans was preformed by Swiss Physician Gottlieb Burkhardt in the late 1880s. Of the six patients he operated on only one died directly due to the procedure. (Another patient committed suicide several years later.) The remaining 5 patients were notably calmer and more easily managed than before, thus this early experimentation was seen at the time as highly successful. \n\nLobotomies remained however relatively rare for human treatment in the following decades. Further research focused again on animals and behavioral effects. Carlyle F. Jacobsen and John Fulton  showed in 1935 how aggressive responses in aggressive chimpanzees could be eliminated through frontal lobe ablation. Conversely, previously docile chimpanzees were made more aggressive. However, the main point is that scientists were not researching how to make chimpanzees sane, they were researching effects in behavior. \n\nAt the same time, Portuguese neurophysician Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz and Pedro Almeida Lima were developing tools and techniques to be used in humans to sever the fibers connecting the prefrontal cortex and thalamus. In 1937, they had operated on around 40 patients, with mixed results. However, many cases were viewed as successful as they were able to eliminate negative behaviors such as aggression and outbursts. They did not make people sane, but that was not the goal. Despite the cases where negative behavior worsened, the procedures interested the medical community due to the lack of alternative treatments. \n\nWe can imagine the hopelessness many patients and families felt when faced with severe mental illness. We also have to realize that reporting of symptoms and analysis of medical data to determine long term effects was much less rigorous in the 1940-1960s. \n\nThis led to the trend, spurred on by the American neurologists Walter Freeman and James Watts, to increasingly use their version of the ice pick lobotomy, which was considered less invasive due to the skull not being opened, for increasingly minor ailments. Around this time in the 1940s, lobotomies were being framed as restoring sanity rather than just changing behavior, which in turn led many families and institutions to peruse this treatment.\n\nThat being said, there was always criticism and resistance to lobotomies by other medical professionals. The negative effects were known and reported on when they occurred, but many long term effects by their nature only appeared years later. The era of performing lobotomies on a large amount of patients was actually rather short, lasting only from the 1940s to the mid 1950s. For example, between 1949 and 1952, over ~50,000 lobotomies were preformed in the US making up a majority of theorized ~60,000 lobotomies preformed at all in the US.\n\nMoniz was awarded the Nobel Prize because the Academy found the research interesting and noteworthy. After all, it is simply a private organization that decide who wins the prize. A Nobel Prize is prestigious, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a small group of people giving out a prize. Many people that have been criticized to be warmongers have also won the peace prize. \n\nSources for further reading: \n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/lobotomy\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/stories-55854145\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/story/how-many-people-actually-got-lobotomized\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy#purpose", "label": 1}

In my youth, most fathers were granted a lot more freedom to not participate in their children's lives. This wasn't true for all fathers, obviously, but my father and many other dads did not show much interest in the kids activities. \n\nI'm not even saying that these men were cold, I'm saying they were not expected to do a lot of things that fathers are expected to do now.  \n (Certainly, I never heard of any man being in the delivery room and it's almost expected of men nowadays!)\n\n My dad never attended my brother's baseball games or attended any of my music recitals, for instance. And it wasn't expected of him or the other fathers! Mom did all of that stuff. \n\n They were let off the hook because they were, supposedly, the breadwinners and were too tired. They were treated as the kings of the castle. Given priority. \n\nAffection is born from familiarity and actually wanting to interact with your children might fall quite short if they weren't home a lot either.   I don't remember my dad giving hugs or much of that kind of affection. He didn't ignore me either, so I knew he loved me. He did enjoy making dad jokes and took me out grocery shopping with him every week, but otherwise, us kids were just other people that lived in his house (who he let watch TV with him. Oh yes, he allowed us to get up and change the channel since the remote had not been invented yet!)\n\nAs a non-historian (who loves to read about history anyway), my guess is that, in the past, this varied from family to family, but in general, I think men were allowed to leave the home and pursue other worldly things (like jobs,  politics or any outdoor activity) and didn't consider affection to their children to be of the highest importance. It might depend on how religious they were, or how present their own fathers were, as well and they also might have the Victorian attitude of \"spare the rod and spoil the child\". People had to grow up quickly and there was little patience for \"spoiled\" children.\n\n I'm sure many fathers were affectionate to some degree, but their job was to provide a house and possibly support for their acquiring a skill or education-  if they were a boy. And feeling pressure to get them married off if they were girls. In fact, I imagine most men considered girls a burden. You still see that in many parts of the world, after all!", "label": 1}

Which checks out considering it was one of the countries where a disproportionally large portion of the population were involved. The statistics eventually normaled out, but only after the WW2 generations started dying out.\n\nIn summary, I'd say that yes there were addiction issues, but they didn't necessarily involve the same substances. People with PTSD tend to look for things to deal with the day-to-day of that.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The short answer is because, before psych meds, these very ill patients would be violent towards the staff and other patients. They would be restrained in straitjackets in generally fairly poor conditions (who wants to try to clean someone who will claw your eyes out?). Sometimes staff would use physical beatings to subdue the patient. Lobotomy was not ineffective at curing them of the violent tendencies and making them more passive, aka they could leave the asylum/would not need institutionalization where they would be treated miserably. But people started using it for milder cases, against the advice of several psychiatrists and neurosurgeons.\n\nThe long answer:\n\nIn 1888, Gottlieb Burckhardt, a Swiss neuropsychiatrist, was the supervisor of an insane asylum. He performed localized cerebral cortical excisions on six chronic schizophrenic patients. One patient died after the surgery, and several developed aphasia (inability to speak) or seizures. However several patients did become easier to manage. The experiment shocked many in the medical community and no further experimentation in psychosurgery for several decades. Then, in 1935, Carlyle Jacobsen and John Fulton performed frontal lobe ablations in chimpanzees. Also in 1935, Antonio Moniz and Pedro Lima drilled 2 holes into a patient's head and poured ethanol into the prefrontal cortex. The operations were considered limited successes; there was a reduction in the symptoms of severe paranoia and anxiety in the patient, and in the chimpanzees there was a reduction in agitation in one chimp. \n\nMoniz and Lima continued to perform the operations on approximately 40 patients by 1937. Some patients improved, but some did not. Some, after improvement, had relapses. Moniz later received the Nobel Prize in 1949 for his work. Walter Freeman and James Watt, two American neurologists, made modifications to this procedure to use a surgical tool instead of alcohol to perform the procedure; they named the procedure a lobotomy. The practice was widely adopted because there were few other treatments. Some American neurosurgeons heavily criticized this practice, but the media had taken this idea and popularized it, leading to demand for the procedure. It was performed more widely in Europe than in America, but in both locations there were many patients who underwent lobotomies. In 1945, Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, through the eye socket (orbit), which would not be scarring.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, the point of lobotomies was to reduce agitation and anxiety, in the hopes that they could be released from the institution. Some patients did have reductions in their outbursts and symptoms. Others didn't. Others became apathetic and unable to concentrate. Some became catatonic, and a few died after the procedure. By the 1950s, the side effects of lobotomies became widely known and opinion shifted against them. In particular, Dr Freeman performed a lobotomy on Rosemary Kennedy, John F Kennedy's sister, and left her permanently incapacitated. The first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, was invented in 1951, and FDA approved in 1954. It worked to tranquilize patients. It had severe side effects, so the next antipsychotic, clozapine, was developed in 1959. The combination of development of antipsychotics and the awareness of severe side effects led to lobotomies becoming a procedure of the past.\n\n https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy#history-and-background\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446267/\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/lobotomy\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2655089/", "label": 1}

{"text": "For one thing, Malaysia's legal system has two separate systems: one code of conduct for Muslim Malays and a different code for Malays of other religions/nonreligious. So they don't have to abide by each other's laws and can choose their own lifestyles. In general though, they also have had more political stability, less armed conflict, and no dictators compared many Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Those three issues are what destabilized alot of existing democartic systems in the MENA region (and around the world.) \n\n  \nFor example, Syria was technically a democracy and has religious freedom written into their constitution. But with the rise of the Al-Assad dictatorships, the political repression, the protests, the Civil War, the rise of Islamist groups- it fell apart and became oppressive. Another example is Lebanon's government system where of their president and prime minister, one is a Christian and one is a Muslim at all times. They've managed to preserve pluralism and democracy through that but still deal with issues of corruption and armed conflict. Another example is Palestine, who has had similarly had Muslim, Christian, etc. mayors/governors for cities that had more of that certain population. Many of its most popular political parties like the PFLP were also democratic and secular.   \nYet, a variety of factors like competition for resources among different ethnic groups, internal corruption, war, terrorism, and religious extremism have totally destabilized the systems those countries had. And in that vacuum, with majority of the population being Muslim, it led to support for Islamist groups. But I think one example that stands away from that example is Saudi Arabia. They've been a monarchy with parliament bodies since they were founded (so not a democracy), and they've only ever had an Islamic-based legal system.

Let's start with the internal reasons;\n\nPeople in east germany could easily see how \"socialism\" struggled, as they'd have to wait years for a car, that wasn't up to modern standards at all, couldn't get building materials, replacement parts etc.. The only way to get certain things was either western currency or \"Vitamin B\" (B stood for Beziehungen - connections), you needed to know the right people for getting what you needed. In addition to that it was public knowledge, that leadership had a very different standard of living, complete with western wares, high(er) end cars, no shortages etc..  \nIn addition to that it was fairly obvious, that many industries were worn down and/or outdated. The rivers were filthy and poisonous, many cities reeked of chemical waste, two stroke exhaust and outdated coal stoves. (My mom told the story, that in her hometown it reeked of catpee, due to the wind sometimes blowing the exhaust of the sodium carbonate factory)  \nThe constant fear of being spyed on by your neighbors, coworkers, friends and even family also didn't help morale.\n\nHere the external factors come into play. If the population believed those issues to be common and normal this would've probably caused less discontent, but \"Westpakete\" (care-packages from western germany) and \"Westfernsehen\" (west german TV) provided a (limited) window into the west german quality of life. The people weren't supposed to, but could see how much better and more accessible many goods were in the west, especially as many of them were produced in east-germany and then shipped into west-germany.\n\nIn short the discrepancy between life in the \"better german state\" and the supposed enemy, combined with the out-of-touch-ness of east-german leadership contradicted state propaganda so drastically, that it sometimes couldn't be taken seriously.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First of all I want to point out that I am biased, I am German (Swabian to be precise) and can only answer from a German perspective.\n\nLooking at this from a historical perspective the answer is a clear yes. For the longest time Austria and most other German countries where part of the Holy Roman Empire. Since nationalism was not really a thing a German identity liek today did not exist, however a broader German cultural and linguistic group of people could be identified. The Holy Rman Empire included other ethnicities so there was no emphasis on German nationhood. The standard to identify who is German historically was always who speaks German as amother tongue. During the era of nationalism before Germany existed this was identified as the \"true Fatherland\" of the Germans, all the land where German is spoken. \n\nDuring the struggle for Unification Austria was mostly part of the convesation. However the two most powerfull German countries Prussia and Austria disagreed on a lot of things. Austria was in favor of a multiethnic central European empire while Prussia disliked the idea because they wanted mostly Germans or Germanized peoples in their empire, and they also did not want to concede politcal power to the Austrians by virtue of them having non German subjects in their southeastern territories. So Austria was excluded from the formation of the German empire. \n\nAfter German unification of 1871 Austrians were still considered German and they considered themselves Germans and where officially listed as Germans in official documents. Despite Prussian-Austrian Rivalry the prussian led German empire and the Austro-Hungarian empire were still closely allied. Then World War I happened and both the German Empire and Austria were dissolved as a result of that. \n\nIn the aftermath of WWI most Austrians favored a unification with the Germany, however the treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye prohibited such unification and the \"Republic of German-Austria\" was formally renamed to the Republic of Austria. \n\nWhen a couple decades later a certain Austrian with a funny mustache became chancellor of Germany and blatantly violated the treaty of versailles by building an army, stop paying reparations and reconquering annexed and occupied land. Both countries decided to ditch their commidment to never unite and did exactly that at what is known as the Aschluss. From all historical accounts I am aware of the Anschluss, literally connection, was widely popular in Austria and faced very little political resistance. This is controversial because after WWII a lot of Austrians created a myth about being the first victims of world war II, in my opinion this is absurd and revisionist, but I will leave it to an Austrian to explain this tale. \n\nWhatever the case, after World War II Austrians started to actively distance themselves from their German heritage. While Germany entered a critical reexamination of their crimes the Austrian strategy to cope with the Nazi history was do dissociate. \"The evil Nazis were Germans so we can't be that\" is the gist of it. As a result of this politically motivated dissociation most Austrians today will not identify as Germans.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf your standard for identifying an ethnicity is what people identify themselves, Austrians used to be Germans but are not anymore since the 50s. \n\nIf you base this definition by language and culture, you have two choices. Either there is no German ethnicity and the people you call Germans are ethnically Bavarian, Swabian, Hessian, Saxon, Thuringian ect. or Austriasn are Germans.", "label": 1}

So, to cure this plague, various Popes organized \"religious\" excursions to the Levant and such areas in order to clear Europe's countryside of these militant bands.   In this single example, I believe religious leaders utilize their influence to solve economic or cultural problems and certainly have used warfare to do so.

Ethnicity unfortunately is also used to justify racist politics, for example the common ethno-nationalism of many right wing parties in Europe. It seems that ethnicity is often used in place of race, but in the end, it results in similar divisions between people. So I think I'd rather go with culture than ethnicity since really, is there anything besides culture that actually matters in this? Even ethnicities in pre-history and history are recognized mostly by cultural signs, such as artefacts and language, rather than only genetics, which does not seem to add much beyond seeing that populations defined by some genetic markers exclusivel are very rare and probably not a result of conscious policy, rather than isolation or similar issues.

Rise of Totalitarian Ideologies\n\n* Both communist and fascist regimes emerged with unprecedented control over populations\n* Modern bureaucracy and record-keeping enabled systematic persecution\n* Mass media and propaganda allowed for effective population control\n* Ideologies that dehumanized certain groups became widespread\n\n1. Scale of Population and Organization\n\n* Larger global population meant more potential victims\n* Modern state structures enabled coordinated actions across vast territories\n* Improved organization meant more efficient implementation of policies, including deadly ones\n\n1. Notable Examples:\n\n* World War I: \\~20 million deaths\n* World War II: \\~70-85 million deaths\n* Holocaust: \\~6 million Jews and 5 million others\n* Stalin's regime: \\~20-30 million deaths\n* Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution: \\~30-45 million deaths\n* Cambodian Genocide: \\~1.5-2 million deaths\n\nThe medieval period, while violent, didn't have the organizational capacity or technology to carry out killing on such a massive scale. Medieval violence was more localized and limited by technological and logistical constraints.\n\nThe 20th century combined several deadly elements:\n\n* Modern technology\n* Totalitarian ideologies\n* Efficient bureaucracy\n* Mass communication\n* Large populations\n* Industrial methods\n\nThis created a perfect storm for mass violence on an unprecedented scale.

There are a few reasons Doc might know Reagan, however.\n\nReagan made 30 films between 1937 and 1942, but most of these were B movies. He had many leading roles, however, and a few very well known supporting ones, including on \u201cKings Road\u201d and \u201cKnute Rockney, All American\u201d (Reagan\u2019s later nickname \u201cthe Gipper\u201d comes from his character in the latter film). \n\nGallup named him one of the top 100 stars of 1941-42. Does top 100 make him a household name? Probably not. But it makes him a certified star.\n\nReagan was also part of a power couple: He married Jane Wyman in 1940, who became an Academy award winner for Best Actress and whose career took off more quickly than his (which led in part to their divorce). So his famous wife is another reason that he would be known.\n\nFinally, in 1954 Reagan began hosting General Electric Theater, a television anthology show. While it\u2019s not much remembered today, it would have been one of only a (relative) handful of TV programs on in 1955. So many people, probably including Doc Brown, would know Reagan from TV if not his movies. \n\nBut do we really think Doc Brown watches bad TV and B films? No, not really. \n\nThe real reason that Doc Brown knows Reagan is because Reagan was the president of the Screen Actors Guild and testified as a \u201cfriendly witness\u201d at the House on Un-American Activities hearing in 1947. Yes, Reagan was an FBI informant. While that particular piece of information wouldn\u2019t come out until later, I believe that Doc Brown is the kind of guy who would have bristled at Joseph McCarthy.

{"text": "I\u2019d have to read through some of the literature again, but the first identifiable statements to that effect - mostly diary entries and private letters - are from late August of 1941. By that point, the Wehrmacht had been engaging the Red Army for two months, and while the Germans were still advancing, they were also *still* facing fresh troops. They knew the numbers, because they recorded them; they knew how many aircraft and tanks they\u2019d destroyed, how many men they had taken prisoner, had at least a general idea of how many they\u2019d killed. And all of these numbers were staggering - as one German general quipped, \u201ewe have now counted 200 Soviet divisions destroyed, despite military intelligence assuring us they had no more than 160\u201c. \n\nAnd yet, despite all this carnage, the Soviets kept fighting. And likewise, the Germans knew their own casualties and the toll the gigantic Eastern Front was taking on logistics. Most, if not all, German generals were very familiar with Napoleon\u2019s advance into Russia (which had started on the same date as Operation Barbarossa, a symbolism that was not lost on Germans). They had convinced themselves that the premise of Barbarossa - the Red Army would collapse at the first heavy blow and take the Bolshevik state with it - was realistic, and after two months of fighting they realized that this was not going to happen. Well, some of them did, at least. This was not a mainstream position: the Wehrmacht\u2019s press office announced the campaign in the East to be effectively over on October 10, 1941. It had ended, of course, with a German victory. \n\nIn reality, meanwhile, by the end of 1941 anyone who didn\u2019t have his brains addled completely by Nazism knew the war was lost. Albert Speer was probably the highest-ranking Nazi who later claimed to have known then (how true that is is another matter), but \u201eDecember 1941\u201c seems to be a bit of a standard answer to the question \u201ewhen did you realize we were going to lose the war?\u201c And for good reason, in light of the defeat before Moscow and the declaration of war on the United States.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Stolen from Quora:\n\nYes, RR was an Actor and was in Hollywood for almost three full decades from 1937 to 1965. He was a leading man at Warner Bros., and at his peak as an actor, he was receiving more fan mail than anyone else at Warner Bros., except Errol Flynn. In 1941, he signed the 1st million dollar contract given to an actor. In addition, during WW II, he was a Lieutenant and then a Captain in the Army Air Force Corps. but due to horrendous eyesight, he was assigned to make training and propaganda films as an Actor and so his face was the most recognizable during the war, in terms of the movie going public.\n\nIt is true that he was of limited range as an actor (although critics reviews were generally good on his work for what was required) but he was a favorite of directors because he was always on time, knew his lines cold, often requiring only one take for his scenes and helped other actors on the set to make the movie as good as possible. In fairness, his true talent was for romantic comedies and some of these, such as \u201cThe Voice of The Turtle\u201d did very well at the box office. If you actually do research on his acting career, you will discover that he was in a number of prestigious films early on in his career in Hollywood, as \u201cDark Victory\u201d and \u201cKings Row\u201d (his best dramatic performance as a co-lead) were both nominated for the Oscar for \u201cBest Picture\u201d. He was also cast as the lead romantic interest in \u201cThis is the Army\u201d, which at the time, was the biggest grossing musical ever, with music by Irving Berlin that won an Oscar. He also was featured in two major films \u201cSanta Fe Trail\u201d and \u201cDesperate Journey\u201d with Errol Flynn, receiving co-equal top billing in the latter.\n\nAfter WWII, he film career began a slow side and while he was still making movies throughout the fifties, his roles were in less memorable films. An exception was \u201cThe Hasty Heart\u201d in which he co-starred with Patricia Neal and Richard Todd, with Todd getting an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He also started to make westerns in the 50\u2019s and \u201cTennessee\u2019s Partner\u201d with John Payne and himself was a good one.\n\nHis career in Hollywood received a boost in the 1950\u2019s when he transitioned to the new medium of Television and acted as host of \u201cGeneral Electric Theatre\u201d This show ran for eight years and Reagan also starred as an actor in many of the episodes, along with a host of other film actors who rarely did television. It was a top ten show and it was on this show\u2019s basis that he received a Hollywood Star on The Walk of Fame in 1960, years prior to a \u201cSecond act\u201d as Governor of California. In all, he made over fifty motion pictures (not counting the hundreds of film shorts he did during WWII) and scores of TV credits. He also performed as an actor and a host later in the 60\u2019s on the popular syndicated and long-running series \u201cDeath Valley Days\u201d\n\nRR had a very solid, if not spectacular career in Hollywood as an actor and you do not get to hang around for nearly thirty years and amass all the credits he did without some real talent. His reliability, looks, voice and ability to project off the screen to the audience in terms of his very likeable personality were his stock in trade.", "label": 1}

After the war he partcipated in around 50 more movies and TV episodes, but his acting career never took off so that Robert Mann desribes the 1954-Reagan as \"a washed-up Hollywood actor with few prospects for reviving a film career that had never delivered the stardom he desired\" (Becoming Ronald Reagan, Introduction).\n\nDuring his army time he mainly contributed in creating training films, among others [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3sOM8Q1is).", "label": 1}

The [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/revolution_n?tab=etymology) dates the political sense of revolution to 1615, but gives no further detail. We can get this detail, however, from French dictionaries (as \"revolution\" is mainly a loanword from French). The [*Tr\u00e9sor de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise informatis\u00e9*](https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/r%C3%A9volution), probably the best French dictionary, concurs with the 1615 date and attributes it to the work *Remonstrances tr\u00e8s humbles au Roy*, specifically the phrase \"*certaines revolutions des Estats, pendant lesquelles toutes choses viennent en vigueur; et elles finies, tombent en ruyne*\" [certain revolutions of states, during which all things come into vigor, and they end by falling into ruin]. This is derived from an earlier meaning of \"abrupt change,\" which the TLFi dates to 1559. The TLFi dates the meaning of \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" to 1636, from a certain Monet, who wrote: \"*Revolution d'etat: Publicae rei commutatio, conversio*\" in what looks like some kind of French\u2014Latin dictionary.\n\nThe *Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise* corroborates this. [Its 1694 first edition gives two meanings:](https://www.dictionnaire-academie.fr/article/A1R0169-03) 1) the circular movement of heavenly bodies or of the four humors, and 2) an abrupt change. The political use is given as an example of definition two. The 2nd\u20144th editions from 1718\u20141762 revise this second definition to \"change in public affairs or the state of the world, while editions from 1798 explicitly mention the violent overthrow of a government as a definition, listing historical revolutions predating 1789, but conspicuously *not* mentioning the one that had just happened in France.\n\nSo in summary, the word originally meant \"circular movement,\" then \"abrupt change\" in general, then \"change in public affairs,\" then \"dramatic, possibly violent transformation\" was solidified by the 1789 French Revolution.

The German war economy was already failing to provide what was needed. Things aren't looking great.\n\nThis is in November 1941. Lend lease essentially begins giving the soviets materiel in Oct 1941. So they've been getting free stuff for a month or so? Has any of it even reached the front yet? Previous to this the soviets had been purchasing weaponry using their gold reserves abroad, rather than any lend lease. Even including what they began purchasing, the total amount of materiel shipped in 1941 was 360k tons, 2% of the total lend lease that would be sent over. A paltry amount considering the utter scale of a conflict involving millions of troops. \n\nNow at this point the war was not by any means won, but we can see Germany begin to falter, and it wouldn't be long after this that they never make another significant advance. I'm also aware that stopping an attack and then spending 3 years counter attacking all the way to Berlin are two very different things. But considering how dire a situation we paint for Germany in Nov 41, and the small effect lend lease has had at this stage, do we not feel the above overstates the impact of lend lease on stopping Germany?

In making those (usually historically inaccurate) movies about D-Day, Americans tend to believe that they were the only country involved (which irritates Brits and Canadians to no end), and that most of WW2 was fought in France because that's where D-Day was.   \n2. When it comes to China specifically, WW2 happens in the middle of their Civil War/Communist Revolution. To put in an American context, it'd be like if someone invaded America half-way through the Civil War and then there was this really weird chapter of the Yankees and Rebels fighting on the same side... and then that war ended and they went back to their Civil War.

While the civil war was \"put on hold\" during WW2 to resist Japanese intervention, skirmishes between nationalist and communist forces continued.

{"text": "This was such a great question!  \n\nFor nearly two thousand years, China held onto one of the world\u2019s most successful monopolies: tea. They had the right natural conditions, of course, but they also knew how to keep their methods and secrets under lock and key. The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) thrived in Yunnan\u2019s misty, mountainous climate, with its high humidity, acidic soil, and moderate elevation that made it almost impossible to grow anywhere else. Other countries tried to copy it, but without that unique combination of conditions, it was hopeless. And it wasn\u2019t just about growing tea. China took things up a notch by turning tea-making into an art form, with each region specializing in different kinds, like Fujian\u2019s rock and white teas, Zhejiang\u2019s Longjing green tea, Yunnan\u2019s pu\u2019erh, and Anhui\u2019s Keemun black tea. Each of these became almost legendary because of the specific local conditions and centuries of specialized techniques (Gardella, 2014).\n\nThe tea-making process was incredibly intricate. You couldn\u2019t just pick the leaves and dry them; there was a whole system of careful leaf selection, withering, rolling, firing, and storing that required precise timing and skill. This wasn\u2019t information you could find in a book. Families and guilds protected these techniques fiercely, only passing them down orally or recording them in code. The whole process was divided up so that no single worker could piece everything together. So, when foreign nations tried to break into the tea market, they hit a wall. The Dutch, Portuguese, and French all tried to smuggle seeds or plants out of China between the 1720s and the 1760s, but the plants died, the seeds were sabotaged, or they simply couldn\u2019t figure out the secret steps to tea production (Van Dyke, 2005).\n\nIt actually sounds a lot like what Venice did with Murano glass ! Venetian glassmakers were masters of their craft, producing clear and beautifully colored glass that no one else could match. To keep the knowledge from leaking, Venice moved all the glassmakers to the island of Murano and forbade them from leaving. If a glassmaker tried to leave or share secrets with foreigners, he faced imprisonment\u2014or worse. This allowed Venice to keep its luxury glass monopoly for centuries, just like China with tea.\n\nAnd then there was the Canton System in China\u2014a whole setup just to control foreign trade. Foreign merchants who wanted to trade with China could only do so in one place: the city of Guangzhou (Canton). They were restricted to specific quarters known as the Thirteen Factories and could only work through licensed Chinese merchants (the Cohong), who managed all interactions. Everything was monitored, from trade volumes to pricing and currency exchanges, with government supervisors on-site to keep a close eye on foreign movements. This kept foreign influence in check while China raked in massive profits and protected its monopoly (Chan, 2013).\n\nThe first big crack in China\u2019s monopoly came in the 1840s when British botanist Robert Fortune managed to smuggle tea plants and processing knowledge out of China. He disguised himself as a Chinese merchant, went into the heart of tea-growing regions, observed how tea was made, and even recruited Chinese tea workers. His success was partly a matter of timing: the Opium Wars had weakened China\u2019s control over trade, and British influence was on the rise. Fortune\u2019s mission led to British-controlled tea plantations in India and changed the tea market forever (Rose, 2010).\n\nEurope had similar stories with other luxury goods too. For instance, the Portuguese once had a monopoly on cinnamon from Sri Lanka. They carefully guarded the trade routes and methods of harvesting to keep prices high, just as China did with tea. And another classic example is Dutch control of nutmeg and cloves in the 1600s, where they used brutal measures to keep production and trade restricted to their own colonies. So, the whole game of protecting prized commodities wasn\u2019t unique to China, but they did it for an impressively long time and with one of the most beloved products in history.\n\n\n\nChan, K. S.

{"text": "I have read pretty extensively about American troops in WW2 and I have not come across any examples of known Nazi sympathizers in the ranks. Now, that doesn't mean that they didn't exist but just that they were likely few enough in numbers to not really be known or for some other reason for not mentioned as a problem.\n\nWith that being said, there were some attitudes that might have changed over the course of the war. For one, many American troops questioned why they were fighting Germany in the first place since they were attacked by Japan. They did not understand the intricacies of the politics that led them to North Africa and Europe. As Rick Atkinson put it - they had to learn to hate. I believe any sympathy for Nazis in the ranks would have been pushed out by the necessity to deal with the reality that those Nazis were trying to kill them. Furthermore, once they came across the concentration camps there was even more hatred for the Nazis. \n\nThere is the additional issue of desertions. Particularly after the liberation of Paris desertion in the ranks was a problem with as many as 30,000 GIs AWOL in and around Paris in the fall of 1944. It is possible that sympathizers may have taken the opportunity to disappear and not fight. This is pure conjecture on my part but everyone who deserted would have a reason and I can assume that 100% of them weren't simply because of fear of combat. \n\nI will add one final point, the American Nazi Party had incredibly limited membership and while they may have hosted a significant rally in 1939 it seems that the war changed the attitudes of many people about Nazis, especially after the revelations of the Holocaust.", "label": 1}

The only way to defeat the Soviet Union from the West is with a quick knockout blow. We know today that the Soviet Army, despite its woefully under prepared state, had the manpower reserves to absorb the German onslaught. They had a larger manpower reserve than Germany expected because they did not have to worry about Japan attacking from the East. Japan decided not to attack the East because of how severely Zhukov bloodied their nose at Khalkin Gol. \n\nPeople like to hem and haw about the possibilities of the axis winning world war II- literally the only manner in which I could see that happening would have been if Japan had left the US alone in order to simultaneously attack Russia with Germany. Russia would have had a two front war, and the US might not have found a legitimate reason to intervene with direct military force. But in order for that to happen Japan would have had to have adopted the complete opposite military approach than what they historically did, hence why Germany winning the war was never realistic in the first place", "label": 1}

{"text": "First off, you're under a misconception, Plan Dalet wasn't a Zionist battle plan for conquering all of Palestine. It had very specific aims and was produced in March 1948 due to the course of the Civil War.\n\nYou see, the previous December, the local Palestinians started putting together a ragtag militia of volunteers called the *Holy War Army*, led by the most revered Palestinian at the time, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni.\n\nThis group of irregulars wasn't very effective until February, when Abd al-Qadir realised that the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem included some Palestinian villages at very strategic points. By placing a couple of snipers at these point, relief convoys from Tel Aviv could be halted, thereby putting West Jerusalem, which had a population of 100,000 Jews, under siege. Jerusalem falling was not something the Zionists were willing to accept.\n\nTherefore, a plan had to be created to eliminate the Palestinian irregulars in the Jaffa-Jerusalem corridor: a military offensive that would involve the capture of all Arab villages on either side of that road, as well as some other important locations. By doing this, West Jerusalem could be relieved.\n\nThe plan, of course, resulted in 300,000 Palestinians either fleeing or being forcibly expelled. But this was not the primary objective, though it's possible that it was a secondary one. The main goal was placing that corridor under Yishuv control. The West Bank was not important in this phase.\n\nAs for why the West Bank was outlined, that's because the Jewish Agency had a few dealings with King Abdullah of Transjordan. Basically, in exchange for Abdullah not dedicating an invasion into the Jewish territory, the Yishuv would not interfere if he tried to conquer the Arab parts of Palestine.\n\nThis deal fell through right before Transjordan intervened, but Abdullah still saw it as an unofficial understanding. Therefore, Transjordan was the first country to announce that they would be intervening to halt the Civil War. Its real objective was always a land grab, while ignoring the Jews for the most part. Hence, Transjordan and Israel were called \"the best of enemies\". This is actually a big reason why the other Arab countries invaded as well, as they wanted to contain Abdullah's dream of ruling Greater Syria.\n\nThe understanding somewhat went wrong as both sides hadn't actually clarified the issue on Jerusalem, so when the IDF advanced, so did the Arab Legion, and the two fought bitterly. But the Legion never made any other attempts to invade the territory held by the Jews.\n\nMost of the Yishuv's leadership didn't really care about the West Bank in the short term (except for Begin and his ilk)  as the territory had too many Arabs, so Israel wouldn't be able to maintain its Jewish character, unless it expelled another few hundred thousand people, which would mean that Transjordan, and potentially Britain might dedicate themselves to a full military victory.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I think the idea that the wars between Catholics and Protestants are due to Christianity \"having no doctrinal basis for religious toleration\" is faulty at best.\nReligious wars in Europe did indeed involve religious factors but more often than not we're based on complex political and social issues much deeper than some people holding different religious beliefs. You had nobles and magnates choosing which denomination to follow based on power jockeying concerns, you had Catholic France allying itself with Protestants states against Catholic Habsburgs, you had the German peasant wars where the religious motifs were prisms through which social issues were projected...all that is lost if we simply see it as a \"Christianity leads you to a black or white paradigm, hence the war\".\n\nIn the same sense the \"religious toleration\" of Islam was possible because it was a latecomer to the Abrahamic scene of religions, emerging in a context where Judaism and Christianity were already present and thus developing a way to deal with them and their followers.\nIn practice it meant the subjugation of religious minorities (a situation that sometimes seemed preferable to revolt to them, nonetheless). The interesting thing is that the model was happily adopted by Christian leaders after contact with Islam. The different Castillian and Aragonese kings very frequently adopted pacts with the Muslim inhabitants of kingdoms they conquered which meant that, in practice, they became the second class citizens that Christians had been before them.\nOne must also remember that the religious toleration in Islam was no obstacle for several civil wars between different sects (the four fitnas), the revolts by the sect of Kharajites, Sunni Shia conflicts or the persecution of minority islamic denominations (a good example of this being the alevis in the Ottoman Empire).

{"text": "Your question lies on an asssumption, that the concept of secularisation can be imposed on islamic societies the same way we use it in the context of christian societies, but i do not blame you. I'll explain the problem with this:\n\n  \nAt worst this assumption is a reductionist view of islamic tradition as static and monolithic, and ignores the historical and geographical diversity of islam. I highly recommend Shabab Ahmed's very comprehensive and paradigmatic book \"What is Islam?\", where he offers a new conceptualisation of the human and historical phenomenon of islam, focusing on the post-classical period. In summary, Ahmed challenges our tendency to equate islam with its more literal and legalistic interpretations and labelling other, particurlarly various forms of sufism and philosphy, as gradually less \"islamic\" based on their distance to this centre. As a response to this Ahmed conceptualises various strands of islamic tradition as different ways of making sense of the core texts of religion, all of which have competing truth claims. Islam should be seen as a hermeneutical engagement with the revelation of God, open to interpretations and re-interpretations rather than only fixed doctrinal lines.\n\n  \nI believe this perspective can help us rethink or move away from the secularisation concept in the context of islam. Modernity and secularisation emerged specifically in response to Europe's own sociopolitical contexts. Historically, islamic societies have accommodated multiple, sometimes contradictory understandings of the relationship between religion, law, ethics etc. without strictly dividing religious from non-religious life. Societies based on islamic tradition might follow alternative pathways to modernity, and this modernity does not universally require secularism as we know it. Thus, the ongoing transformation of islamic societies should not be seen as \"islamisation\" or \"secularisation\", but simply as the transformation of the broader discursive tradition that is islam. This approach acknowledge the distinctive intelletual, social and cultural dynamics of islamic societies, recognising their transformations as rooted in their own interpretative frameworks rather than in a need to emulate the west.\n\n  \n(1) Ahmed, Shabab, \"What is Islam?

{"text": "The groups you picked out were singing in a doo-wop style. Doo-wop is a genre of American pop music that was big in the 1950s and was just losing popularity around the time of the recordings that caught your interest. To compress a really interesting bit of music history into a paragraph, doo-wop began when young people (especially urban black teenage boys) in the late 1940s wanted to emulate the sound of pop music but didn't have access to instruments, let alone a whole orchestra. They did, however, have a strong grounding in vocal music thanks to church choirs and school music lessons, as well as exposure to gospel and r&b music which allowed a different take on the swing music they were hearing. So they improvised by forming vocal groups which as existing techniques such as harmonization and call & response but also at times during the song repeated nonsense syllables that simulated or otherwise took the place of instrumental accompaniment. Even when the genre moved from street corners and community dance parties into professional studios with session musicians, the \"doo-wop\" (as the nonsense syllables came to be known) remained a part of the style, serving more as a vocal hook than as a replacement for instruments, which is what you are hearing in those songs which are arguably \"neo doo-wop\" or \"post doo-wop.\"", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm not a historian but this is what I know based off what I have read about each administration. \n\n**JFK** \n\nKennedy's decision to expand relations with Israel was motivated by several factors taking place at once\n\n* The Cold War in the Middle East where the Soviets were engaged in arm sales to Egypt and Syria. This is important because in the subsequent Six Day War and Yom Kippur war both nations played crucial roles in each. \n* JFK desired a series of concessions from both members of Congress as well as the Israeli political leadership. And they centered around Palestinian refugees from 48, Israel's nuclear program, and funding for UNRWA(which ironically is in the news now). Kennedy hoped that give he lifted the arms embargo on Israel that in exchange the Congress would continue to fund UNRWA(which at the time was threat with a cut in aid) and Israel would compromise on allowing the right of return for Palestinian refugees as well as access to its nuclear facilities. JFK was able to get one of these 3 attempted compromises(UNRWA) but not the other two. \n* The November Mid Term elections also played a role where the Kennedy Administration wanted to bolster their support among Jewish Americans\n\n**LBJ** \n\n* Johnson was already a strong advocate for Israel from before he came into office. During the Suez Canal Crisis he opposed Eisenhower's policy of putting pressure on Israel to withdraw when he was Majority leader in the Senate. \n* The Johnson administration agreed to arms sales to Israel as part of a wider joint arms deal with Jordan as well. In other words in order to get Israel concessions on the sale of arms to Jordan, the Johnson Administration was also willing to engage in the sale of arms to Israel. \n* Johnson was president during the 6 day war which had a significant impact on U.S Israel relations in terms of support for offensive weapons to Israel at the time.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This isn't a question about the USSR I think- the term you are looking for is perverse incentives. Incentive structures that create undesirable results- they wanted cheap food for their populations and ended up feeding bread to cows, they wanted to subsidise their industries with cheap fuel and ended up with people wasting it because keeping water heated 24/7 was cheaper than other solutions. These might well have occurred if they used a different system anyway- price signals don't matter fi you are ignoring them. The issue wasn't that they weren't aware that they had driven certain goods prices below self-sustaining levels and raised the costs above the open market rate. It's that they were choosing too- to either subsidise and grow an internal industries (cotton is a major part of economies in the steppe land ex-soviet states) or to subsidies the population. The pricing systems are just signals- they don't achieve anything if they're ignored. \n\nWhy they persisted with this in the USSR even after it was clear the negative consequences outweighed the benefits is that no individual was empowered to act and people were disincentivised to try- ultimately they had a political system where individual incentives of decision makers were structured to oppose collective incentives. You could frame the same question about Britain's corn laws, which fixed the price of certain goods up to protect British farmers from competition from foreign sellers. Political decision making and central control creating system with perverse incentives are very common. \n\nIn Northern Ireland a decade ago the government spent \u00a3500m on a renewable energy scheme that allowed people to make a profit from burning wood pellets, so people burned a huge amount of wood pellets unnecessarily. They were responding logically to the market conditions, even if the end result is a lot of money wasted to achieve the exact opposite of what they were hoping to achieve. The issues with the scheme were apparent immediately but it took time for it too be dealt with because it was politically embarrassing and there were allegations of individuals within the party governing the scheme profited from it. \n\n  \n*\"What stopped them from using more sophisticated accounting or the benefit of a free market profit incentive to normalize their internal economy and simply expropriate the profits?\"*\n\nIt's not a simple process to identify and expropriate the profits (ie tax) of free enterprise in the free-market economies when you are only taking a portion, with heavy incentive on the individual to cooperate rather than step outside of law- if you are taking the whole of the profits that logic collapses. So this scheme wouldn't create the profit incentive, would still create the perverse incentives you discuss and would give less oversight to the state. That would still empower the same level of bureaucracy that caused the issues for the USSR, just give them different job titles. If the profits are all paper profits then false reporting and black marketing is still endemic and the individual financial reward incentive is still to act against the interest of the whole.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I know this sub likes detailed answers but this is a question which is really easy to answer. The answer is that portion was ceded to the UK by the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, Convention of 1818. \n\nArticle II set the boundary between British North America and the United States along \"a line drawn from the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods, \\[due south, then\\] along the 49th parallel of north latitude...\" to the \"Stony Mountains\" (now known as the Rocky Mountains). Britain ceded all territory south of this new boundary, including portions of the Red River Colony and Rupert's Land (comprising parts of the present states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota). The United States ceded the portion of the Louisiana Purchase lying north of the 49th parallel (the northernmost portion of the Mississippi River watershed, including those parts of the Milk River, Poplar River, and Big Muddy Creek watersheds in modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan). The article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War. The earlier treaty had placed the boundary between the United States and British North America along a line extending westward from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River. The parties did not realize that the river did not extend that far north and so such a line would never meet the river. In fixing the problem, the 1818 treaty created a pene-enclave of the United States, the Northwest Angle, the small section of the present state of Minnesota.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The USSR avoided using real prices because its leaders believed central planning could achieve a more \u201cfair\u201d and controlled economy than one driven by market forces. They aimed to create a society where everyone had what they needed, where resources were allocated based on societal goals rather than profit motives. But the reality proved quite different. The lack of real prices in a centrally planned economy like the USSR created fundamental economic issues that contributed to its eventual collapse. Let\u2019s break down how each of these problems emerged, with concrete examples.\n\n**1. Chronic Shortages and Surpluses:**\n\nWithout real prices to guide production and distribution, the USSR\u2019s economy constantly faced shortages of essential goods. For example, bread and meat, staples in any society, were frequently in short supply. Long lines became a common sight as people waited hours for basic items. This shortage of food wasn\u2019t because the USSR didn\u2019t have resources; it was because the planners failed to allocate them properly. \n\nMeanwhile, certain products piled up in excess. A famous example is the massive surplus of heavy machinery and industrial goods produced during the 1970s and 1980s. The government prioritized production quotas in sectors like steel and machinery, which it deemed crucial for industrial progress. The result was warehouses full of machinery that was often unused, while everyday people struggled to get essentials like fresh produce or toiletries.\n\n**2. Misallocation of Resources:**\n\nCentral planning meant that economic decisions were made based on quotas and targets set by bureaucrats rather than by actual consumer demand. One of the clearest examples of misallocation is the Soviet emphasis on military and space industries. The USSR poured vast amounts of resources into building its military and competing in the space race, diverting funds and resources away from consumer needs. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union had one of the largest standing armies and an impressive space program, yet its citizens lacked access to quality housing and consumer goods like clothing and appliances.\n\nAnother example can be seen in agriculture. Soviet planners often dictated which crops to grow, regardless of the suitability of the land or the preferences of the local population. In Ukraine, known as the breadbasket of Europe, the forced collectivization of farms led to disastrous famines. Because central planners disregarded local knowledge and demand, agricultural output plummeted, resulting in the 1932\u201333 famine that caused millions of deaths. \n\n**3. Poor Quality Products and Lack of Consumer Focus:**\n\nThe planned economy led to low-quality products because factories were rewarded based on meeting production quotas rather than on quality or consumer satisfaction. Soviet car manufacturing is a classic example. The USSR\u2019s main car, the Lada, was known for its reliability issues and outdated design. With no competition or consumer feedback driving improvements, the Lada remained largely unchanged for decades while Western cars became more advanced and appealing.\n\nConsumer goods in general were of low quality. Many people had to buy whatever was available, often settling for goods that quickly broke or didn\u2019t meet basic standards. Even in the 1980s, Soviet citizens were struggling to buy durable household items, like washing machines or refrigerators. In contrast, capitalist systems tend to produce higher-quality goods because companies must compete for customers, leading to constant innovation and improvement.\n\n**4. Stifling of Innovation:**\n\nWithout real prices and a market-driven environment, the USSR\u2019s economy had no room for entrepreneurial innovation. In capitalist economies, real prices signal demand, creating opportunities for businesses to develop new products and meet emerging needs. In the USSR, innovation was almost entirely limited to state-approved sectors. For instance, the USSR excelled in military and space technologies but lagged significantly in consumer technology. Personal computers, for example, were rare in Soviet homes, and the technology was largely outdated compared to Western standards.\n\nThe Soviet scientific community did make strides in fields deemed strategically important, but these innovations rarely translated to improvements in the lives of ordinary citizens. Entrepreneurs had little opportunity to take risks or develop new products. The lack of a profit incentive and market signals meant that consumer tech, like televisions, household electronics, or even fashionable clothing, was often years behind what was available in Western countries.\n\n**5. Economic Stagnation and Eventual Collapse:**\n\nThe USSR\u2019s economic system became increasingly inefficient as time went on, which led to stagnation. By the 1980s, the Soviet economy was unable to sustain growth. Without real prices and market mechanisms, the economy couldn\u2019t respond flexibly to new challenges or adapt to changing circumstances. The 1970s oil crisis, for instance, put additional strain on an economy that was already struggling due to the flaws of central planning. Unlike market economies, which adjusted by shifting production and investments, the USSR\u2019s rigid system couldn\u2019t adapt effectively.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the inefficiencies were so deep that reforms couldn\u2019t reverse the decline. Mikhail Gorbachev introduced policies like *perestroika* (restructuring) and *glasnost* (openness) in a desperate attempt to salvage the economy. However, decades of inefficiency and lack of innovation had already weakened the Soviet system, and it was too late to compete with the dynamic economies of the West. In 1991, the USSR officially dissolved, with economic failure being a primary cause.\n\nThe USSR\u2019s decision to avoid real prices was based on an ideological belief in central planning over market forces. However, the real-world outcomes were chronic shortages, misallocated resources, poor-quality goods, and stifled innovation, all of which ultimately contributed to the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. This experience illustrates how communism, though appealing in theory, often fails in practice because it doesn\u2019t align with the complexities of a real, adaptive economy.", "label": 1}

Coming out of the 60s an overtly 'white Canada' policy wasn't exactly politically tenable any more. That, and as European migration slowed down, it meant it wasn't economically viable any more either because we no longer had a steady source of cheap (white) immigrant labour.

{"text": "I am not a professional historian, but this does relate to my expertise. During the 1950's Soviet mathematician Leonid Kantorovich pioneered the field of linear programming. To put it reductively, linear programming is a way of determining optimal solutions to set problems by making the best use of limited resources. He saw the lack of real prices as a serious shortcoming of the Soviet system, and to get around this he devised the idea of \"shadow prices\", that is, prices for goods which are not exchanged in the marketplace. Now obviously, these shadow prices are built on a lot of assumptions, as commodities are not having their prices \"realized\" in the marketplace. Kantorovich lobbied hard to integrate linear programming and shadow prices into the Soviet planning process, primarily through Premier Alexei Kosygin. Institutional resistance to any form of pricing was intense however, and Kosygin's 1965 economic reforms ultimately dropped his methods due to pushback from within the party.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nSmolinski, Leon (1973). \"Karl Marx and Mathematical Economics\".\n\nAllen, Robert\u00a0C.

{"text": "The Soviet leadership didn't want to just let \"prices float freely\" and \"redistribute profits\" because that is simply not socialism. Of course we can debate whether the Soviet system was socialist or not (socialists themselves have debated it for a long time, between those who defend it was, albeit with flaws and limitations, to those saying it was a form of \"state capitalism\", with in-between positions).\nBut the crux of the issue is that if you keep the profits and productive unit you are keeping the essential feature of the capitalist mode of production. Social democracy is based on what you propose: you let the market operate freely, and capitalists get rich. But then the State comes and takes a bit of those profits and gives them to workers so that everyone benefits from those profits being generated in the first place. This is also, conveniently, in tune with Rawlsian notions of Kantian ethics: inequality is admissible insofar only as we are all at least better off compared to how we would be had the mechanisms that produce said inequality not been in place. That is: capitalism is admissible even with the inequality it generates, because it at least is a rising tide that elevates all boats.\n\nThe Soviet leadership wanted both everyone being better off and abolishing the exploitation of human by human. So they wanted to abolish the profit incentive, which of course is easier said than done and leads to many other issues. If you're interested in the topic, Paul Cockshott and All-in Cottrell are two economists that have written in depth about the limitations of the Soviet system and how better ways to integrate, manage and redistribute information (in part thanks to modern technological innovations) have made it possible to overcome such limitations.

{"text": "The economy of the Soviet Union was heavily influenced by the need for total mobilization for military production during WWII. State set prices for goods were useful for this economic model, which was in use for most of the Soviet Union's existence, and the dismantling of this system was a contributing factor in the Union's collapse.\n\nA key element of this system was the separation between consumer cash and the money used for large transactions between state-owned enterprises. In essence, the Soviet Union had two fully separate economies. \n\n**Beznal,** or \"cashless\" economy was used for transactions between industries or organizations. Importantly, until Gorbachev, this money could not be used for anything other than transfer between industries, it could not be used for payroll and thus would not find its way into the hands of everyday consumers. For example, a mine and a foundry would use beznal transactions between each other to balance the books as goods were transferred between industries. The state-set prices for goods were useful because they ensured this system was stable, and since there was not a way to access this money otherwise, it could function independent of inflation or deflation. Prices could be changed on the industry level to curb inflation and to ensure that Soviet Citizens weren't able to hoard cash. \n\nPart of why this system worked and was stable for so long was because every aspect was controlled by the communist party, so changes could be made vertically. As you stated, the plan system and its strict nature could lead to issues in goods production and quality, although this could theoretically be avoided by economic planning at the highest levels.\n\nThe Nal, or Cash economy, was cash in the hands of consumers and prices for cash could fluctuate within the Soviet Union, and in the 1980s as industries gained increasing independence in terms of what they could produce this indeed did happen.\n\n  \nIn essence, the Soviet state-mandated system was used because it was very stable and gave the communist party many levers to manipulate the economy; when this worked well it could be used to curb inflation and also had benefits to easing the development of the defense industries. \n\nMy source is Chapter 1 of Vladislav Zubok's book \"Collapse: the Fall of the Soviet Union\" which looks at the end of the Soviet Union from an economic lens, in Chapter 1 he overviews the economy as it existed before Gorbachev's reforms.

{"text": "I can give you some answers, however, when it comes to the specifics of each place colonised, there is often specific things that play a major role into Japan's initial success in occupation/colonisation of these countries.\n\nStrong military/Navy:  \nJapan's Navy was very strong, they both had incredible ships they themselves built, such as the Yamato, but also had bought ships from other countries, like Britain for example, and they even had a ship from Argentina. Military expansion was a big part of Japan's policies at the time, and they did it in a variety of ways. Japan sold a bunch of bonds, which they are still heavily indebted to today. A lot of financial policy reforms also influenced the strengthening of the military, I will leave a source [here](https://www.jacar.go.jp/english/glossary_en/tochikiko-henten/column/column1.html) if you want to learn more in depth about this.  \n  \nGaining resources from occupation: While Japan may have been limited in regards to some resources, as their conquests went on, those resources greatly expanded. [Countries like Brunei and Malaysia were abundant in oil which was a major factor in the Japanese occupation of them.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170921082244/http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2015/08/22/sarawak-and-the-japanese-occupation/) Additionally, Japan was rich in iron. However, due to the extent of their imperial goals, they did need to expand. One way they did so was taking resources from the Japanese public, as an example [\\~90% of bells from Buddhist temples were given for the war effort](https://kousin242.sakura.ne.jp/wordpress027/index.php/history/kingendai/000-2-2/). In Japan, if you go to a Buddhist temple, it is not unlikely that you'll see two holes drilled into it. To test the quality of its metal.\n\nWeakening of European powers/help from local groups: Because of World War 2, Europe's resources and focus were away from Asia. This led to a large gap in the security of the colonies. However, it should also be noted, the European powers were never as strong as one may think. They didn't conquer these countries through power, yet, manipulating politics and finding allies inside of these countries. In India, many were fed up with the oppression of the Mughals. So, many powerful figures actually worked with the British. Then, slowly gaining favour from powerful people in India, led them to stretch their control very far. They also did a lot to try and stop violence from erupting in colonised countries. The Sepoy Mutiny was very near to success, and it was what changed the policies of the British towards British Raj to try and not step on culture or anger the locals too much (of course, this still happened a lot, like with the relations between the Sinhalese and Tamils), as well as weakening their power. On top of that, many militias inside of these colonies initially sided with Japan. After oppression from the Western powers, Japan's goal of freeing eastern and southeast Asia from colonial powers seemed very appealing, when nobody really knew what it entailed. One famous example would be Azad Hind. A government formed by Indians in Singapore, led by Subhas Chandra Bose. Initially, Bose sought out the help of Nazi Germany, but they had no concern for him or the Indian independence movement, although Hitler did give it a bit of praise. So, Bose sought out Japan for help, and Japan gladly helped and they formed Azad Hind in Japanese occupied Singapore. They advanced into Bengal from Burma, but this never went that far. Nearing the end of the war, the combination of resources running out, the U.S.'s involvement, the weakening and end of Nazi Germany, and one can else not forget, the now growing resentment of the people under control of Japan, ultimately all combined to led to the downfall of Japan's Imperial Empire and their inevitable defeat.", "label": 1}

I will also be purposely trying to avoid my own arguments against their works for the sake of time and focus on the philosophy of citing heterodox works.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not as picky about degrees\u2014as you said, no one would be able to argue much at all without pushing a but into inter-discipline territory\u2014but if a strong consensus of people with degrees within a field finds an argument or author not agreeable I will be more likely to trust the phds than the one source.  I see all academic disciplines as a series of methodologies and communities and not much else.\n\n> An economic historian might not be an \u201ceconomist\u201d if you define it (correct me if you don\u2019t) as someone with a degree in economics. \n\nEconomic historians are considered economists but the hard shift economics has done towards the quantitative side has taken has left economics history in a weird position.  Regardless they are very published within mainstream econ journals.  \n\n> Wouldn\u2019t he be able to speak about the history of some country\u2019s economy? Conversely, an economist would be barred from speaking about the same topic for not having a degree in history? \n\nMy problem is not that he lacks a degree, but that the common consensus is that he lacks the understanding, sourcing, and knowledge to be an authoritative source.\n\n> Maybe you don\u2019t hold Cockshott in high esteem, but the other author I mentioned, who you left out, Allin Cottrell (who holds a PhD in economics), apparently does so to the degree of having coauthored many books with him on issues related to economics. \n\nAllin Cottrell is an economist but as a marxist is very much within the heterodox sphere.  Neither (marxist or heterodox) is not inherently a bad thing but should be considered when you are citing something in a field.  I\u2019ll get to this in a moment.\n\n\n> Cockshott\u2019s expertise is also relevant to the field as his computer science theory is useful regarding the use of computers in the processing and flowing of information in economies.\n\nCompletely agree, having more specialists to pitch in ideas is an infinitely useful thing but if most other authors do not believe he actually countered any points.  Isn\u2019t that just strawmanning?\n\n> PS: what\u2019s wrong with heterodox authors? Can\u2019t we cite Steve Keen or Randall Wray in economics? Mises, whom you cite, is an Austrian school Economist, and thus not orthodox (ie. Neoclassical) at all!\n\nThere\u2019s different contexts for citing authors (I cited an early work that has loosely inspired modern ideas, tho do just read modern works), my point was simply to alert others that these sources were not respected in the discipline.  For the same reason I will alert others outside history about the works of David Irving, Graham Hancock, or Jared Diamond.  I do not personally believe the fact that they are outside consensus is inherently wrong\u2014actually it should be cherished\u2014but is something to note for outsiders.  I maintain a consensus view on academia because I do not know everything.  I cannot tell you why Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s quantum physics book is BS, just that most quantum physicists have not nice things to say about it.  I personally can\u2019t confidently speak much outside of my subfield on international economics.  There are many obvious and not so obvious flaws to such a philosophy but it is the standard I hold myself too.  Hence why I alerted everyone that Cockshott and Cottrell should be carefully sourced in this context and why I offered reputable ones.", "label": 1}

Sidenote: as much as I love behavioral economics it suffers the replication crisis worse than any other subfield.  Side-side note: Austrian economics and most heterodox fields exist because of their reluctance to be interdisciplinary and work with other fields or subfields (for the same reason cranks exist in every discipline; I\u2019m not saying these two mentioned are cranks but ya get what I mean), it is also part of why they are disliked by the mainstream.\n\nThis is for u/Limp-Ad-5345 as well.  Milton Friedman is a very respected figure within the discipline of economics for pioneering quantitative methodologies that most social sciences use now\u2014I feel there is a humanities & social science clash going in here, whatever that means\u2014so I would argue he was simply doing what every other field in the social sciences were doing.

{"text": "It's not uncommon. \n\nThroughout Mexican history, there have been several instances where soldiers in the Mexican army deserted or quit their service due to various factors such as poor conditions, lack of pay, low morale, or political instability. Some notable instances include:\n\n1. Mexican-American War (1846\u20131848)\n\nDuring the Mexican-American War, desertion rates were high on both sides, but especially within the Mexican army. The Mexican army faced harsh conditions, a lack of supplies, and inconsistent leadership, which led to many soldiers deserting or returning home.\n\nSoldiers were poorly equipped and paid, and many were conscripted against their will. When faced with overwhelming U.S. forces and seeing little chance of success, many simply abandoned their posts.\n\n\n2. Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920)\n\nDuring the Mexican Revolution, many soldiers deserted the federal army, especially as revolutionary forces gained strength. The political instability and changing allegiances led to high desertion rates.\n\nSoldiers were often forced to fight under local warlords or military commanders with unclear loyalties. As the revolution progressed, large numbers of soldiers defected to join revolutionary armies such as those of Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa or Emiliano Zapata, while others quit the military entirely and returned to their homes.\n\n\n3. Pastry War (1838\u20131839)\n\nIn the so-called Pastry War between Mexico and France, Mexican soldiers faced difficult conditions, including a lack of food, ammunition, and support. This, along with political instability, led to desertions as soldiers abandoned their posts and returned home.\n\nThe conflict itself was relatively brief, but the Mexican army's poor state of preparedness and low morale were key factors in why many soldiers decided to quit.\n\n\n4. French Intervention in Mexico (1861\u20131867)\n\nDuring the French Intervention and the imposition of Emperor Maximilian I, many Mexican soldiers deserted, especially those fighting for the imperial forces. The lack of pay and poor conditions, along with growing opposition to foreign rule, led to desertion, particularly in the later years of the conflict.\n\nMany soldiers switched sides to support Benito Ju\u00e1rez's republican forces or simply returned home to avoid further fighting as French and imperialist forces lost ground.\n\n\n5. Texas Revolution (1835\u20131836)\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution, many Mexican soldiers deserted after the defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna\u2019s army, which had been forced to march long distances with limited supplies, faced extreme fatigue and low morale. Following the Texan victory, some Mexican soldiers either deserted or were left stranded as the Mexican government struggled to regroup.\n\n\nThese desertions were often driven by poor conditions, lack of leadership, and a sense of futility in continuing the fight. Many soldiers during these periods were conscripts, meaning they were forced into service, which contributed to their willingness to leave the military when conditions worsened.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Yep, mass desertion was not very uncommon even in recent history, one of the most stark examples being an estimated 17% of the entire Ottoman military force deserting their posts in WWI \u2014 mostly due to absolutely horrible conditions on the front, the deteriorating Ottoman political apparatus, and disillusion with the cause of the war. \n\nThis is was in the context of a new, unstable government installed by the Young Turks in 1908, followed immediately by the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, which gutted and demoralized the Ottoman military. So, by the start of WWI, there was strife in the government, minority uprisings across the empire, and a military force without cohesion or impetus. Even the Ottoman entrance to the war was partially due to hope that a strong alliance with Germany and mobilization for war would aid the restrengthening movement.\n\nBy the time the fighting actually started, and throughout the war, soldiers were getting paid late or not at all, military positions were terribly undersupplied, and there was no expectation that the state would have any way to punish desertion. So, troops fled.\n\nMore directly to your post, to my understanding, most mass desertion in history has been because of troops belief that they could leave the hellish battlefield conditions with little punishment, rather than a deep moral objection to their leader\u2019s reasons for declaring war. \n\nBy the time the fighting actually started,", "label": 1}

I'm not completely familiar with a lot of Mary Shelley's work but my assumption is that her opinions were highly based on the romanticization and anti-savagery views of native Americans while a lot of other Europeans at the time had polar opposite views and almost romanticized the destruction of the native Americans as they were seen as savages and subhuman. Essentially colonizing their land was for the greater good.\n\nThings get murky. You had people like Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher who openly wrote about how the native Americans were being killed and how unfair and unjust it was but at the same time held viewpoints that native Americans were essentially a weak subspecies or sub-race that wasn't even capable of having a culture... So again the European viewpoint on North American natives was very skewed based on their source information. My opinion is that most of the people that lived in European regions were not well educated on different cultures that existed in the world at the time (realistically how could they be?)... You only knew what you were told and levels of diversity even in Europe where a completely different culture of people may exist 80 mi away from you, was very low.\n\nSo while many Europeans had empathy for Native Americans they justified that genocide with a belief system based on colonization and things like the spread of their religion.

When Pyrrhus of Epirus was an up-and-comer and contending for the throne with Demetrius Poliorcetes, one of the things Pyrrhus supposedly did was duel the commander of Demetrius's secondary army and defeat him. Pyrrhus very much sought to emulate Alexander and, reaching farther back, Achilles; after he defeated Demetrius's general Pantauchus in one-on-one combat and put his army to rout, those surviving soldiers probably passed that legend along their ranks. Later, when Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia and Demetrius confronted him personally, Pyrrhus's reputation as a born warrior and Demetrius's suffering reputation as a reprobate caused his men to desert to Pyrrhus en masse. It's one of the reasons that Demetrius eventually rolled the dice by invading Anatolia before he was hemmed in and captured by Seleucus. (Plutarch, Lives of Pyrrhus and Demetrius; W.W. Tarn, Antigonos Gonatas)\n\nFor other examples from this period, see Eurydice who went to fight Alexander the Great's mother Olympias, but her soldiers refused to contend with the aura of Alexander's mother and deserted before the battle.

{"text": "First, I want to quickly point out that those fictional soldiers had been mercaneries, that morale was low and we have remarks of desertion already happening. And, if memory serves right, Stannis argued prior against hiring mercenaries for their lack of loyalty to a cause, but was convinced and forced to do so because of the circumstances. One of those many well done details of the show!\n\nThen, as others already have pointed out, there are many incidents in history of similar things are happening. Here are a few examples, not only referring to kings but their leaders.\n\n\\- Alexander the Greats conquests came to an abrupt halt on the Ganges river in todays India. His men, exhausted after years of campaign and in the face of a strong opposing army, refused to cross the river and forced Alexander to return home. It is speculated, that he took the desert route back as a revenge on his people for this betrayel (see i.e. Heckel 2002, 68). Plutarch describes the mutiny as the following:\n\n>\\[...\\] they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. \\[...\\] \\[3\\] At first, then, Alexander shut himself up in his tent from displeasure and wrath and lay there, feeling no gratitude for what he had already achieved unless he should cross the Ganges, nay, counting a retreat a confession of defeat. ([Plut. Alex. 62, translated by Perrin, 1919](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0007,047:62))\n\n(- Only indirectly applying to your question, but during a quick research I stumbled about an episode worth mentioning of mass desertion in World War II. The neutral Ireland recruited in 1940 40,000 men at arms, fearing an invasion. After this did not happen, a year later desertion rates peaked; at the same time there have been around 10,000 Irish soldiers voluntaring for the Britsh forces. \"it is possible that as many as 15 per cent of all southern Irish male recruits attested by British recruiting staff in this duration were deserters from Irish defence forces.\" (Quinn, 2021, 833). The total amount of deserteurs is unknown, but estimated around 7,000, which is a remarkably high percentage of the total man at arms. Joseph Quinn paper on it is quite interesting (DOI: 10.1177/0968344520932960).\n\n\\- Also worth mentioning is the very brief refusal to fight during the so called Christmas truce in 1914, a series of events of opposing soldiers left their trenches end celebrated Christmas in no-mans land.", "label": 1}

There is a great contrast between the ability to read millions -- indeed billions of years into the past -- in terms of geology, and tens of thousands of years into the past as regards human DNA and genetics.  With languages, in contrast, the ability to reconstruct the \"genetic\" affinities between languages, via tracing sound changes, does not go back farther than around 10,000 years.  That, in itself, can be impressive; for example, we do know that Ancient Egyptian and Hebrew, or Arabic, are distantly related and are part of the same family.  Or that Latin and  Icelandic are.  Further back than that, the \"forensic traces\" of common origins have seemingly been lost to time and are non-recoverable. It's as if the thumbprint has become too smudged, or has been washed away entirely.\n\nWere it to suddenly become transparent, however, it likely would lead to some shocking revelations.  We might be able to identify affinities between would-be language isolates, such as Basque and Sumerian, with other families. Unexpected affinities also could have revealed themselves as regards, say, a Native American language such as Quechua, and some of the languages of Central Asia (such as the Turkic).  While hypotheses have been made for the existence of much broader language families -- the \"Altaic\" hypothesis; the \"Nostratic\"-- the alleged evidence is spread thin, and these not widely accepted by linguists.  What we do know, nonetheless, is that human language likely goes back far more than 10,000 years -- the cave paintings at Altamira go back \\*36,000\\* -- and that it's unlikely that, when human communities split from each other via migration, they recreated language from scratch.

{"text": "I can answer this. Lived it.\n\nThe original \"skinhead\" subculture came to prominence in the late 1960s. It was not a racist subculture that you associate with the word \"skinhead\".  The year 1969 was the year of the traditional (non-racist) Skinhead cult.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead\n\nFast forward a few years, and punk rock was gaining popularity.  Many of the young people who were embracing punk rock were skinheads.  1977 is the year of Punk.\n\nSome of those early punk bands garnered significant skinhead followings, and were often involved with hooliganism and violence, giving skinheads a reputation as being tough and rowdy.  Far right organizations in the UK noticed this (primarily National Front), and began recruiting amongst punks and skinheads.  One of those early 1977 punk bands was called *Skrewdriver*, and they released their first album, a generic non-racist punk album. More on them later...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(UK)\n\n1982 saw the *second wave* of punk rock.  Along with this second wave came new subgenres of punk as the genre developed, one of which was called Oi!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi!\n\nOi! is a working class variant of punk rock, and is primarily associated with skinheads and the skinheads subsculture.   During this time (early 80s) some of these skinheads were recruited to the far-right.  Culturally, racism was a problem. Like, a real problem. A few years earlier, there was an anti-racist movement called Rock Against Racism that organized rallies and concerts, mostly in response to racist attacks, and sparked by racist remarks made by David Bowie and Eric Clapton. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Against_Racism\n\nSome of the far-right oi! bands began to call their music \"Rock Against Communism\". \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Against_Communism\n\nThis genre of music is the birth of the far-right rock music scene.  It was spearheaded by the band Skrewdriver, who's singer Ian Stuart Donaldson reformed the band with new members after converting from a punk to a skinhead.  Skrewdriver, amongst others, would play neo-nazi music with the most extreme National Socialist ideology.  At the core of this new music movement was the organization Blood & Honour.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_%26_Honour\n\nBy the late 80s, nazi skinheads had come to dominate the skinhead scene, which had originally been multiracial and based on a love for Jamaican music and fashion.  At the same time, the metal music scene was flourishing.  In the extreme metal world, extreme ideologies are common. \n\nAs hardcore punk became heavier and faster in the 80s, many of the skinheads (both racist and non-racist) who were a part of those scenes were beginning to \"crossover\" from the hardcore to the metal scene. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_thrash\n\nA lot of the early crossover bands were hardcore punk bands that started playing metal, and many of those hardcore punk bands were skinheads.  Not necessarily racists, but they were there too.  The racist ideology also crossed over with them, and far-right metal came along. \n\nIn the early 90s, Black Metal came to prominence and one of the common themes of black metal is Norse paganism and other non-Christian, anti-Abraham religions. Nazis had the same obsession with paganism. \n\nInsert: National Socialist Black Metal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_black_metal\n\nNazism, occultism, extremism... it all blends together into NSBM.\n\nThe neo-nazi record label Resistance Records started releasing NSBM recordings in the 90s, and that was how nazi metal was spread throughout the world.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_Records\n\nThe vast majority of skinheads ***hate*** racists, racism, fascism, and associated ideologies.

{"text": "> Could this also explain why a particular Indian dialect Sylheti and a lesser extent Manipuri when spoken sounds exactly like classic Welsh? Even containing the same vowel structures?\n\nI'm assuming by \"this\" you mean the fact that Sylheti and Welsh are both Indo-European languages, Welsh in the Celtic family of the European branch and Sylheti in the Eastern Indo-Aryan family of the Indo-Iranian branch. \n\n---\n\n\nYes... but also no. Yes in the sense that they've both descended from the same common source, so there's a way in which they've both at one point had the same sound material to work with... but this is the same as any other pair of languages in the Indo-European family, from Icelandic to Greek to Farsi to Bengali. \n\nThere is actually a meaningful way in which all Indo-European languages do actually have an above average overlap with each other, in grammar and in pronunciation! This is because that 'common source' can only be changed incrementally from one generation to the next, so you've got a lot of inertia in language change which means the daughter languages share a lot of features with each other and with their parents, and so on into the granddaughter languages etc. It's really unlikely to find an Indo-European language with a tone system like Chinese, because Proto-Indo-European (PIE) didn't have one, and so all of its daughter languages, and their daughters, and so on, are all biased against having a complex tone system like Chinese because it's really hard to come up with out of nowhere, and has a lot of steps involved in getting there. Similarly, PIE didn't have click consonants, and so (so far as I'm aware!) none of its daughter languages use click consonants to distinguish different words. In English we have them for *para*-linguistic uses, stuff like tutting, miming a kiss, or commanding a horse, but this is not a *linguistic* use so we exclude it from this discussion. \n\nAnd so we come to the *no* part of the answer which is that both Welsh and (presumably; I'm not a Bengali expert) Sylheti have gone through thousands of years of development since that shared root, and an important rule of thumb in languages is that they are *never* static. So, more important than their common stock 5,000 years ago on the shores of the Black Sea is the fact that they've independently gone through a myriad of different sound changes and have coincidentally ended up looking fairly similar on a *surface* level. This \"surface level\" distinction is crucial, because comparing the wikipedia articles where it lists the vowel inventories, and saying, \"look, these are the same!\" hides the fact that the *correspondence* between those vowels will be very dubious at best. \n\nFor example, the Welsh word for \"goat\" is *gafr*, pronounced /gavr/, and this is descended from a Proto-Celtic word **gabros*; the Sylheti word is *shagol* (I don't have a keyboard for the script, sorry!), which corresponds to a Bengali word \u099b\u09be\u0997\u09b2 *chagol*, /t\u0283\u02b0agol/, in turn from the Sanskrit word \u091b\u0917\u0932 *chagala* /t\u0283\u02b0\u0250g\u0250l\u0250/. Trace it back all the way to their shared root and the Welsh word comes from a PIE word **k\u00e1pros* and the Sanskrit word we actually aren't sure about, but possibly from a PIE word **(s)k\u00e9gos*, which would link it with the English word *sheep*. \n\nSo you see, even if a Welsh speaker would be able to pronounce a Sylheti word pretty well, and vice versa for the Sylheti speaker pronouncing the Welsh word, the words look totally different, and when you start going back even a little ways into history, both of them start changing a LOT. And given that Welsh and Bengali people 1000 years ago were hardly writing each other letters to plan out the next thousand years of sound change in their languages, the fact that they've ended up with such similar inventories now is quite the marvellous coincidence! They were biased to stay in roughly the same corner of possible sound systems by their family heritage, but even within that, there is massive amounts of variation, and languages like to wander.", "label": 1}

Large urban centres with artifacts dating to the 19th century BC have been discovered around the Yellow River where the Xia were supposed to have been. Key to this was the discovery of several dings at Erlitou, large bronze cauldrons that have long been a symbol of Chinese legitimacy, pointing to an unbroken cultural lineage from that period. However, no writing was discovered that is able to link the site to any defined polity and so we still can\u2019t say for sure that this was Xia, though many historians are pretty convinced.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm going to be answering this from the perspective of an undergraduate honour's student who's gotten a lot of advice from my supervisor/other academics in my department. I'm writing my thesis on modern Russian history.\n\nDifferent areas of history have different language requirements; American colonial history will be very different to Medieval Japanese studies. However, researchers will be expected to have a very good functional grasp of the language, good enough to both read it and to translate it into their native language. This is completely different from learning to speak (and to some extent, verbally understand) their working language. Also, they generally only gain mastery of the language in certain subject areas they focus on.\n\nTo get to this level, researchers have to go through specialised training in their undergraduate and graduate programs. This generally involves taking graded courses and passing certification exams, though this depends on the program. Personally, I completed the Russian course sequence at my university and on exchange; this satisfied my department. There are tonnes of academic resources out there to learn ancient or otherwise historically useful languages.", "label": 1}
{"text": "It depends on ones specialization and department requirements on whether it is required and if so the number of languages. Americanists are usually, in my experience, less likely to have that requirement than other regional specializations. I'm a modern Europeanist and so I have a requirement needing to show competency in two other languages outside English. In my case that was Spanish and German. Of those two, German is the one I use pretty much daily. \n\nI proved Spanish competency after sitting through a class and passing a timed translation (with dictionary). Throwing me in an area with no English I'd be in trouble but I broadly know the grammar structure and vocab and with enough time I could bash out a decent approximation of a document. My primary is German and my University sent me to a language learning immersion course in Germany (Goethe) to improve my German. My certificate of completion was enough to prove competency. It's important to note that when we're learning a language in many cases it's not about attaining peak oral fluency akin to a native. It's the ability to do a down and dirty translation. Over time we continue working on the languages we need (reading, writing, and thinking) to improve those skill sets. As a consequence, my German is much better than my Spanish because I haven't had cause to interact with Spanish in a few years.", "label": 1}

Some idiots are still using the \"fake heirs\" insult today. \n\nIt's funny really because the Romans used to have no issues adopting their heirs. \n\nBut it would be an incredibly difficult thing for a medieval king to \"fake\" an heir. The Queen (or Princess) would have to \"pretend\" to be pregnant for several months before going into confinement and that's not an easy thing to do when as Queen you're surrounded by people, your medical progress is being reported on etc. you would have to have a ridiculous amount in on such a story. \n\nSo it's really impossible to be \"faking\" heirs and medieval kings aren't going to want a random child on the throne and a new blood line, given the whole claim to the throne comes via blood..\n\nIf you're a king and can't have an heir, well you might go down the Henry VIII route and look for a divorce or annulment. Your wife may have an unfortunate \"accident\". \n\nBut you'll probably just have to find your closest male relative and accept that they are your heir.

Chinese education about WWII doesn\u2019t cover the full picture. Key facts are often downplayed or even omitted, possibly by design. It\u2019s hard to remember events if they\u2019re treated as just another dry paragraph in history class, especially when they don\u2019t appear on exams. I vaguely remember Chennault being mentioned in my history classes, though I could be mistaken. Chiang Kai-shek, meanwhile, was often depicted as an ineffective diplomat always seeking U.S. aid, while his military role was overshadowed by a focus on CCP activities during the war. This is odd since, although the CCP was active, the KMT bore most of the heavy lifting in fighting the war itself. I only learned the true scale of the Battle of Shanghai from a literature magazine, which was surprising to me. I imagine that Taiwan\u2019s history education might provide students with a broader perspective on the conflict.\n\t\u2022\tThe phrase \u201cChina is often forgotten\u201d might be true because China\u2019s role in WWII was largely defensive. China was mainly trying to hold off Japan within its own borders, meaning it wasn\u2019t often seen as a contributor to the larger Allied strategy. Despite the help it received, poor logistics limited China\u2019s strategic impact on the overall war. China sacrificed millions fighting and suffering, but Japan wasn\u2019t perceived as a direct threat by the West until Pearl Harbor. When a country is more of a liability than an asset, it\u2019s hard for others to take its contributions seriously.\n\nWWII, along with the preceding decades, was one of the darkest times for Chinese people.

{"text": "English teacher here. There are a lot of issues with this question - the first being what a run-on sentence actually is. A run-on sentence is a sentence with multiple clauses connected without proper joining mechanics such as commas, semicolons, or conjunctions. What you describe is actually the opposite of a run-on sentence. \n\nAdditionally, there is no problem with long sentences full of commas and semicolons as long as they are used correctly. The problem tends to be that students write with comma splices instead - an issue where they use commas to separate independent clauses but leave out proper conjunctions. An example would be \u201cI went to the store, I bought bread.\u201d This sentence needs to either use a semicolon instead of a comma, or it needs a conjunction like \u201cand.\u201d The writer could also use a dependent clause: \u201cI went to the store in order to buy bread.\u201d\n\nFinally, students tend to meander - they lose steam halfway through the sentence and it becomes less effective. Readers, too, struggle to follow long sentences due to a lack of exposure to them. \n\nIn summation: these long sentences are only a problem because students (and adults) struggle to write them effectively. If you can write a long sentence correctly, feel free to do so. \n\n(By the way, your final semicolon should be a comma. The part after the semicolon is a phrase that provides more context rather than being an independent clauses connected without.)", "label": 1}

{"text": "Okay, I'm not a historian, but I have worked as a high school English teacher and as an English professor. I have an MA in literature and an MFA in writing. \n\nThere are actually two questions here, because of an ambiguity in the meaning of a \"run-on sentence.\"\n\nQuestion 1: Why do English teachers teach students to avoid run on sentences when many classic writers used very long sentences? \n\nBecause **\"run-on sentence\" does not mean \"long sentence.\"** When the term is used by grammarians, a run-on sentence is a sentence with two or more independent clauses that aren't joined by a semi-colon or coordinating conjunction. They are, to put it in layman's terms, two sentences jammed together without the proper punctuation. \n\nA run on sentence in this sense can be quite short. e.g. \"I yelled at him, he ran away.\" is a run on sentence. \n\nQuestion 2 (implied): Why have long, complex sentences become less popular in literature and writing instruction? \n\nThis is a more difficult question to answer with absolute certainty, because there are many factors at play and its always difficult to pin-point why artistic fads and fashions change. \n\nI can tell you roughly when it happened and point to some of the more influential literary figures driving that change. \n\nThe long, wordy sentences of the 19th century was at least somewhat the result of economic factors: many writers, such as Dickens and Wilkie Collins, serialized their novels in magazines (which literally paid by the word) and sold them in multiple volumes (the more volumes the more money). But it would be a gross oversimplification to say this was the only reason. The arts are always subject to trends and fashions. \n\nThe fashion started to change during and after World War One. \n\nThe term \"muscular prose\" is used to describe the type of simple, direct, and declarative style that we're talking about here. It arose in the early 20th century as part of the modernism movement and gained popularity, especially among American male authors, throughout the century. \n\nErnest Hemingway is a big pioneer here. His distinctive prose style set the standard for muscular prose for decades. He is famous for his \"iceberg\" theory of writing in which most of the meaning is below the surface, and for his very \"muscular\" prose style.   \nSome scholars point to much earlier writers such as Mark Twain, and Hemingway himself was open about his admiration for Sherwood Anderson, but it was the shadow cast by Hemingway, that set the wheels in motion for this to become the dominant prose style in American literary fiction of the 20th century. \n\nOther important figures include the two most famous editors of that century: Maxwell Perkins (credited with \"discovering\" Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, and others) and Gordon Lish.   \n  \n(Editors in the 20th century were a lot more willing to mentor authors and influence their style than editors today.)  \n  \nGordon Lish worked in the 2nd half to the 20th century, and had a strong predilection for minimalist prose. In a now famous interview in the Paris Review, he discussed how much he did to trim the prose of his authors, most significantly the renowned short story writer Raymond Carver. \n\nRaymond Carver was a hugely influential writer in his time, frequently taught and studied in writing and English classes. Carver studied under John Gardner in undergrad and later attended the Iowa Writer's Workshop (the first, most prestigious, and most influential MFA program), and his earlier work was more verbose and florid than the extremely minimalist writing he later became famous for. \n\nGordon Lish takes a lot of credit for that extreme minimalism, and there's evidence that this is the case. We happen to have access to a story that was published in a version edited by Gordon Lish (\"The Bath\") and without Lish's editing (\"A Small Good Thing.\") I recommend you read them side by side to see how much influence an editor can have, and the different effects achieved by these two prose styles. \n\nSince the mid-20th century, high-brow literature has had something of an incestuous relationship with academia. The rise of MFA programs meant that writers and professors were more often the exact same people, and often the type of writing that was admired in the university writing programs was later taught in literature programs. So the influence a writer like Carver (filtered through Lish) can have over how writing was taught became fairly strong.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Monogamy did not really \"become a Christian value\". It was already a Jewish value before the advent of Christianity. The Old Testament from the very beggining was supportive of monogamy: \"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and\u00a0be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh\" (Genesis 2:24). That said, it is certainly the case that Judaism became explictly anti-polygamy later than Christianity. It was not until Gershom ben Judah, in the 11th century, that Western Jews were explictly forbidden from polygamous relationships. Nevertheless, monogamy was certainly the cultural norm long before that. \n\nChristians, from the very beginning, were in favour of monogamy but it is a misconception to attribute this to Roman influence. It was very much influenced by Judeo-Christian scriptural teachings rather than Roman cultural teachings. For instance, Tertullian, writing in 2nd century,  made no reference to Roman conceptions of monogamy in his writings on the issue. Rather, he advocated that Christians should have only one spouse because Christ had only one spouse (the Church), further arguing that this was the model for marriage established by Adam and Eve. If Christ followed the model established in Genesis, Christians had no room to argue that OT polygamy was prescriptive - it was merely descriptive.\n\n[In fact, Tertullian, almost 2000 years ago, responded to the very same question you're asking](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0406.htm#:~:text=You%20see%2C%20therefore%2C%20after%20what,equally%20ought%20to%20have%20been). He plainly stated that the NT models of marriage, such as Joseph and Christ, were \"better\" than those OT prophets, such as David and Soloman, who had numerous wives. \n\nThe TL;DR is that the Church Fathers simply argued that OT polygamy was a description of what was happening rather than a prescription, by God, for what should happen. Just as David's murder was not a promotion of murder, his polygamy was not a promotion of polygamy.", "label": 1}

Polygamy was, evidently, a cultural norm but that doesn't mean it was the theological ideal. \n\n>God made Abraham the father of the Jewish people (Genesis 15).

Abraham had a wife and two concubines including Hagar.\n\n>David is celebrated as a man after God's own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). This exemplar of faith is only admonished for a single romance-related activity: murdering his loyal soldier Uriah in order to bed his attractive wife Bathsheba. His admonishment doesn't say anything about the sin of polygamy; it says alot about the sin of abusing a position of power and privilege (2 Samuel 12). David had 8 wives named in scripture, an unknown number of unnamed wives and an unnamed number of concubines.\n\n>Solomon is the wisest man in history, past and present (1 Kings 3). Solomon was only admonished for one romantic activity: marrying women who didn't share his faith (1 Kings 11). In his wisdom, Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.\n\nTertullian responded directly to all of these characters.

{"text": "If you take almost any of those examples in the context of their narratives, you'll find their polygamy either unwise or openly disobedient to God. The Biblical narratives rarely include explicit condemnations by God for all the foibles of their characters - it isn't just a list of rules, or even a morality play. It's stories, featuring many imperfect people. \n\n* Abraham's polygamy is directly related to his and Sarai's doubt in God's promise that he would have an heir through Sarai. Sarai believes God will not grant her children, although she's been promised this. So her doubt leads her to have Abraham sleep with his slave. And immediately, we see that decision causing friction and bitterness. And when Sarah asks the Lord to judge the situation, we get a narrative of the Lord seeing and protecting Hagar. Neither Sarai nor Abraham are depicted as making a wise, God-honoring decision with Hagar. \n\n* David is caught up in sin several times, though a prophet doesn't always provide specific admonishment. Again, that's a fairly rare occurrence in the Biblical narrative. David's disobedience to God is marriage is fairly obvious to the reader familiar with the Law - who sees David disobeying God in taking wives from the nations around him. And what is the result?

{"text": "There are really two questions here, the first being \u201cwhy did God allow polygamy before the coming of Christ?\u201d And the second being \u201chow did monogamy become a Christian value?\u201d I\u2019m going to answer the second. I\u2019m unsure if the Bible itself is considered an acceptable source in this subreddit, but the answers are laid out very plainly in the Christian Greek scriptures. \n\nFirstly, Jesus himself spoke of monogamy being God\u2019s original intent for the marital arrangement. When the religious leaders of his day tried to find fault with Jesus\u2019 teachings by asking a question about divorce, Jesus answered by quoting God\u2019s words at Genesis 2:24: \n\n\u201cHave you not read that their Creator made them male and female from the first and said \u2018On this account a man shall leave his father and mother and form a connection with his wife, and the two shall become one flesh\u2019?  so that they are no longer two but one flesh. So let not a man part what God has joined.\u201d(Matthew 19:4-6, Byington) \n\nFollowing the death of Christ and the founding of the Christian congregation, Saint Paul provided instruction on how to appoint more overseers and responsible men inside the congregation. Such overseers would need to set the example for other Christians, their faith and lifestyle worthy of imitation. Saint Paul specifically listed \u201chusband of one wife\u201d in three different places as a requirement for Christian men.\n\n\u201cIt is needful then for the overseer to be irreproachable, a husband of one wife, sober of sound mind, orderly, hospitable, apt in teaching,\u201d (1 Timothy 3:2, Rotherham) \n\n\u201cLet ministers be husbands of one wife, Over children presiding well and over their own houses;\u201d (1 Timothy 3:12, Rotherham)\n\n\u201cI left you in Crete for this purpose, to have you straighten out what remained to be seen to and appoint elders in the different cities as I directed you\u2014  anyone who is of blameless reputation, husband of one wife, having believing children not under accusations of debauchery nor insubordinate.\u201d (Titus 1: 5,6, Byington) \n\nIn conclusion, monogamy is a Christian value because Jesus instructed his followers to live that way. Saint Paul confirmed this after Jesus\u2019 death. Although many modern-day Christian beliefs are taken from the belief systems/cultures of throughout history rather than the teachings of Jesus (that\u2019s a whole rabbit hole on its own), monogamy is not one of them.", "label": 1}

Christianity spread first among the poor, and only later to the elites, so those men could barely afford just one wife.

{"text": "*sweats to see if comment gets deleted*\n\nI\u2019m not a historian, but a former seminary student, and can provide only the theological explanation from the general Protestant denominations of Christianity. \n\nGod never intended for there to be polygamy. He allowed it, but did not condone it. \n\nJust like the ancient Israelite monarchy was never intended by God, but was the Israelites desiring to be similar to the surrounding cultures. He allowed it because they were so stubborn.\n\nOr even divorce, Jesus states in Matthew that divorce was permitted by God (during the leadership of Moses) because the people\u2019s hearts were stubborn. \n\nHave you noticed all the passages about slavery in the Bible? In the old and new testaments. A casual reader might assume God also condones slavery. \n\nBut in Genesis 1:27 \u201cGod created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\u201d  \n\nMeaning that men and women, and all ethnicities on earth were created equally in value and in His image. God does not always explicitly state His views, but by context you can see how slavery is directly opposed to Christianity.\n\nNow to your question, monogamy vs polygamy. \nIn Genesis 2:22-24,\n\n\u201cAnd the Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. Then the man said,\n\n\u201cAt last this is bone of my bones,\nAnd flesh of my flesh;\nShe shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019\nBecause she was taken out of man.\n\nFor this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.\u201d\n\nImplying God\u2019s intention for one man and one woman to constitute a marriage. \n\nAlso you can find these additional passages that either discourage or imply that it\u2019s not intended by God. \n\nDeuteronomy 17:17\n\u201cAnd he (the king) shall not acquire many wives for himself, so that his heart does not turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.\u201c\n\nAnd in Deuteronomy 21: 15-17\n\n\u201cIf a man has two wives, the one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons, and the firstborn son belongs to the unloved\u2026\u201d (just verse 15 for brevities sake).\n\nIn which the famous Christian biblical commentator Matthew Henry states,\n\n \u201cIt shows the great mischief of having more wives than one, which the law of Moses did not restrain, probably in hopes that men\u2019s own experience of the great inconvenience of it in families would at last put an end to it and make them a law to themselves. Observe the supposition here: If a man have two wives, it is a thousand to one but one of them is beloved and the other hated (that is, manifestly loved less) as Leah was by Jacob, and the effect of this cannot but be strifes and jealousies, envy, confusion, and every evil work, which could not but create a constant uneasiness and vexation to the husband, and involve him both in sin and trouble. Those do much better consult their own ease and satisfaction who adhere to God\u2019s law than those who indulge their own lusts.\u201d\n\nAnd in 1 Corinthians 7: 2-5 the apostle Paul states one husband and one wife as well.\n\n\u201cBut because of sexual immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband.\u201c\n\nEven Jesus Christ in Matthew 19 speaking of infidelity and divorce states that a man who divorces his wife, and there has been no adultery, may not remarry. And the spouse who remarries (or has sexual relations, dates, etc) with anyone else has committed adultery. So while forgivable by God, this verse also implies a one man, one wife relationship. \n\nSo while the Bible does not explicitly condemn polygamy, and there\u2019s plenty of examples of God allowing (not encouraging or condoning) it, by these (and more passages) we can deduce that God does not approve of polygamy. \n\nThat and all the qualities that are commanded and encouraged in scripture also would not willingly mesh with a polygamous marriage.", "label": 1}

Papa Doc in Haiti ( President of Haiti from 1957 to 1971) was widely considered to have magic powers associated with Voodoo, a belief he actively encouraged, his own secret police the Tonton Macoute being named after the Haitian equivalent of the bogeyman.

To cut a long story short in a world or context where sorcery is believed in it would be naive to assume nobody attempted to practice it. In many nations women or men may use \u201cmagic\u201d to make someone fall in love with them, to wish ill on a rival or good fortune for themselves. This does not mean those accused of being witches are evil just that for whatever reason society\u2019s opinion and the wider context of the era meant that certain practices which in other contexts may be seen as normal or acceptable (fortune telling or potions to create certain results) in situations of stress can suddenly be perceived to be unacceptable or part of malevolent machinations. Of course if you are a bitter social outcast you may in fact cast spells to get back at your rivals and they aware of your bitterness against them may associate any ill fortune to yourself.

This biblical focus, though not an outright ban on polygamy, encouraged Christians to adopt monogamy as an ideal.\n\nTheologically, monogamy was symbolic for early Christians, representing an exclusive relationship with God, as the Church was seen as the \u201cBride of Christ.\u201d Practical reasons also supported this shift; early Christian writers argued that monogamy promoted family stability and reduced rivalry, which aligned with the faith\u2019s values of peace and unity. By the medieval period, monogamy was solidified as the Christian standard, setting it apart from other cultures that permitted polygamy.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Another added layer here is that most writing instruction today has very little to do with creative writing or mimicking the language of novelists. The bulk of school-taught English writing courses are designed for improving students' critical thinking and written communication skills - the version of those skills used in everday activities in the classroom, at home, and in their eventual professional lives. This kind of practical writing serves its audience best through simplicity and concision. While novelists (especially, but not limited to, a handful of modernist writing in stream of consciousness) may write unendingly complex sentences, they do so to complicate the work... to play with expectations and make the readers work for the meaning. Shorter sentences make for clearer communication. Clearer communication is ideal, 95% of the time.\n\nAlso - side note - run on sentences are not just overly long sentences of several clauses strung together. Many of tjose are still entirely correct grammatically. A run-on is a particular kind of sentence fragment that links those clauses together without commas or conjunctions to signal the breaks between syntactic ideas.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I am no expert but would like to lay the following against the above:\n\n**Matthew 19:7-12** suggests Jesus thought being celibate was better than marriage: \n\n>They said to him, \"Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?\" He said to them, \"It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery.\" His disciples said to him, \"If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\" But he said to them, \"Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\"\n\nIn **1 Corinthians 7:1-9** Paul begrudgingly recommends marriage over sexual immorality:\n\n>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: \"It is well for a man not to touch\na woman.\" But because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.\n\n**7:25-40** But recommends you avoid it if possible:\n\nNow concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that, in view of the impending' crisis, it is well for you to\nremain as you are. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But if you many, you do not sin, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin. Yet those who many will experience distress in this life, and I would spare you that. I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no possessions, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away. I want you to be free from anxieties. The un- married man\nis anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the Lord, so that they may be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please her husband. I say this for your own benefit, not to put any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord. If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee, if his passions are strong, and so it has to be, let him marry as he wishes; it is no sin. Let them marry. But if someone stands firm in his resolve, being under no necessity but having his own desire under control, and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee he will do well. So then, he who marries his fiancee does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better. A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord. But in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.\n\nFrom the non-canonical Acts of the Apostles genre, in **Acts of Thomas, CH12-15**, Jesus persuades a newly-wed couple not to consummate their marriage with each other:\n\n>**12**\n>\u201cRemember, my children, what \nmy brother said to you, and to\nwhom he commended you; and know that\nif you refrain from this filthy intercourse\nyou become temples holy and pure, being\nreleased from afflictions and troubles,\nknown and unknown, and you will not\nbe involved in the cares of life and of\nchildren, whose end is destruction. But if\nyou get many children, for their sakes\nyou become grasping and avaricious,\nplundering orphans and deceiving wid\u00ad\nows, and by doing this you subject your\u00ad\nselves to most grievous punishments. For\nmost children become unprofitable, being\npossessed by demons, some openly and\nsome secretly. For they become either\nlunatics or half-withered or crippled or\ndeaf or dumb or paralytics or idiots. And\nthough they be healthy, they will be again\ngood-for-nothing, doing unprofitable and\nabominable works. For they will be de\u00ad\ntected either in adultery or in murder or\nin theft or in unchastity, and by all these\nyou will be afflicted. But if you obey and\npreserve your souls pure to God, there\nwill be born to you living children, un\u00ad\ntouched by these hurtful things, and you\nwill be without care, spending an untrou\u00ad\nbled life, free from grief and care, look\u00ad\ning forward to receive that incorruptible\nand true marriage, and you will enter as\ngroomsmen into that bridal chamber full\nof immortality and light.\u201d\n\n>13\n>And when the young people\nheard this, they believed the\nLord and gave themselves over to him\nand refrained from filthy lust, and re\u00ad\nmained thus spending the night in the\nplace. And the Lord went away from\nthem saying, \u201cThe grace of the Lord be\nwith you!\u201d And when dawn came the\nking arrived, and having furnished the\ntable brought it in before the bridegroom\nand the bride. And he found them sit\u00ad\nting opposite each other, and he found\nthe face of the bride uncovered, and the\nbridegroom was very cheerful. And the\nmother came in and said to the bride,\n\u201cWhy do you sit thus, child, and are not\nashamed, but act as if you had lived for\na long time with your own husband?\u201d\nAnd her father said, \u201cIs it because of your\ngreat love to your husband that you are\nunveiled?\u201d\n\n>**14**\n>The bride answered and said,\n\u201cTruly, father, I am in great\nlove, and I pray to my Lord that the love\nwhich I have experienced this night may\nremain, and that I obtain that man whom\nI have experienced today. That I do not\nveil myself is because the mirror of\nshame has been taken away from me; I\nam no longer ashamed or abashed, since\nthe work of shame and bashfulness has\nbeen removed far from me. And that I\nam not frightened is because alarm did\nnot abide in me. And that I am cheerful\nand glad is because the day of joy has\nnot been disturbed. And that I have set at\nnaught this husband and these nuptials\nwhich have passed away from before my\neyes is because I have been joined in a\ndifferent marriage. And that I had no\nconjugal intercourse with a temporary\nhusband, whose end is repentance and\nbitterness of soul, is because I have been\nunited to the true husband.\u201d\n\n>**15**\n>And when the bride was saying\n even more, the bridegroom an\u00ad\nswered and said, \u201cI thank you, Lord, who\nhave been proclaimed by the stranger and\nfound in us; who have put corruption far\nfrom me, and have sown life in me, who\nhave delivered me from this disease, hard\nto heal, hard to cure and abiding for ever,\nand established in me sound health; who\nhave shown yourself to me, and have\nrevealed to me my condition, in which I\nam; who have redeemed me from falling,\nand have led me to something better, and\nwho have released me from things tem\u00ad\nporary, but have deemed me worthy of\nthings immortal and everlasting; who\nhave humbled yourself to me and my\nweakness, to place me beside your great\u00ad\nness and to unite with you; who have not\nkept your compassion from me, who was\nlost, but have shown me how to seek\nmyself, and to know who I was and who\nand how I now am, that I may become\nagain what I was; whom I did not know,\nbut you have sought me out; of whom I\ndid not know; but you stood by me;\nwhom I have experienced and am not\nable to forget; whose love is fervent in\nme and of whom I cannot speak as I\nought. But what I have to say about him\nis short and very little, and is not in\nproportion to his glory; but he does not\nfind fault with me if I dare to tell him\neven what I know not; for it is out of love\nto him I say this.\u201d", "label": 1}

It doesn't need to be wars between the larger polities (by larger I mean France, England). Feuds between local lords were common too. Medieval Europe. The Holy Roman Empire for example had hundreds of polities, many of which had their own feuds with each other before feuds were outlawed in the Empire by Maximilian I. There are also succession conflicts, which occurred all over the place. For example, the War of the Limburg Succession, or the 100 Years War. These conflicts emerged when a ruler died without an heir and their were multiple claimants for a throne. There were also religious conflicts (like the crusades, and its related conflicts, and the Investiture Wars between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperor).

{"text": "The decline of Buddhism in India was a complex process, marked by shifts in political power, religious transformations, and cultural integration over several centuries. This process began as early as the post-Mauryan period (around 185 BCE), following the fall of the Maurya Empire, which had been a major patron of Buddhism under Emperor Ashoka. The newly established Shunga Dynasty, led by King Pushyamitra Shunga, is often cited as an early antagonist to Buddhism. Historical records and legends suggest that Pushyamitra initiated significant persecution, destroying stupas, burning monasteries, and killing monks. His campaigns reportedly extended as far as Sakala (modern-day Sialkot in Pakistan), where he is said to have offered rewards for the heads of Shramanas (Buddhist monks).\n\nWhile this period marked a turning point, the decline of Buddhism continued over centuries, as successive dynasties, such as the Gupta Dynasty, supported Brahmanical (Hindu) revivalism. In many cases, Buddhist sites and structures were either abandoned or repurposed for Shaivite and Jain worship. For instance, at Ahmedpur, archaeological findings show that a Hindu temple was built atop a stupa base during the fifth century CE. Similarly, Vidisha and other significant Buddhist sites in central India saw Buddhist shrines converted into Hindu or Jain temples by the eighth century, often with Buddhist iconography replaced by deities from these faiths.\n\nThe cultural and religious integration efforts also played a role. As Hinduism incorporated Buddhist ideas and practices, such as compassion and non-violence, Buddhism\u2019s distinct identity gradually diminished. The establishment of monastic communities in remote areas left urban populations with limited Buddhist presence, and when further medieval invasions occurred, these isolated Buddhist monasteries were particularly vulnerable, leading to further decline.\n\nIn summary, the decline of Buddhism in India was not a result of a single factor or event but a confluence of political, religious, and socio-cultural shifts over centuries. Buddhism\u2019s disappearance from its birthplace was gradual, shaped by complex historical dynamics and inter-religious transformations.", "label": 1}

From Andrew Nicholson's unifying Hinduism\n\n> In order to defeat the demons (daityas) who had succeeded in obtaining great powers through religious austerities, Visnu came down to earth disguised as an ascetic and began teaching doctrines contrary to the Vedas. First, disguising himself as the founder of the Jaina school, he taught the doctrine of anek\u0101ntav\u0101da (perspectivism or \u201cnon-one-sidedness\u201d) to the group of demons. **Then, moving on to another group, he changed his outfit and, appearing as the Buddha, taught that animal sacrifices are immoral and so forth. By this means, the demons lost all of the powers they had attained, and were summarily massacred by the gods. This story is remarkable because it accomplishes two goals simultaneously. First, it manages to subsume Buddhism and Jainism under orthodox Brahmanism, by demonstrating that both Mah\u0101v\u012bra (if that is indeed who is portrayed\u2014he is nameless in the Visnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a) and the Buddha were incarnations of Visnu. Second, it completely discredits the actual content of the doctrines of these two sects, by suggesting that the teachings of Buddhism and Jainism are intentionally false and nonsensical.** The dupes are the Buddhists and Jainas, who do not understand that the source of all of the teachings they defend so vehemently is a divine trick.30\n\nAnd as I understand Advaita Vedanta itself wasn't that accepted by other vedanta schools either, as the same trick is used by Vijnanabhikahu to try and try and discredit Advaita as well\n\n> According to the passage from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a that Vij\u00f1\u0101nabhik\u1e63u cites, these t\u0101masa \u015b\u0101stras comprise the following: The \u015aaiva teachings\u2014for example, the P\u0101\u015bupata teachings and the like, taught by \u015aiva himself. The \u201cgreat\u201d (mahat) Vai\u015be\u1e63ika teachings of Kan\u0101da. The Ny\u0101ya of Gautama. The S\u0101\u1e43khya of Kapila. The P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 of the twice-born Jaimini, which deals with the Veda. The despised C\u0101rv\u0101ka system, taught by Dhisana. The false doctrine of Buddhism, taught by Visnu in the form of the Buddha in order to destroy the demons; Buddhism consists of those who are naked and those clad in blue.32 The false doctrine of Illusionism (m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da), which is Buddhism in disguise; \u015aiva taught this in the kali yuga disguised as a Brahmin. This doctrine incorrectly interprets the Vedas. It teaches that ritual activity should be abandoned. \u015aiva has taught the unity of the highest self and the individual self, and that Brahman in its highest form is free from qualities. \u015aiva taught the non-Vedic doctrine of Illusionism in the kali yuga in order to destroy the entire world, while purporting to be teaching the meanings of the Veda.33....While some of the first systems mentioned are described in value-neutral language (or even positively, as when the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is called \u201cgreat\u201d), by the time the reader arrives at the end of the list, it is clear who the whipping-boy of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a is.

Initially very popular (as high as 68 percent approval in May of 81 against a 21 percent disapproval rating), his favorability gradually dropped to as low as 35 percent with a 56 percent unfavorable in January of 83. It stuck around the lower 60s approval until the Iran Contra Affair, where it dropped back into the 40s. His disapproval ratings also rose; basically holding steady around the high 30s and low 40s (other than his final months as a lame duck president where his approval rose to 63 percent and his disapproval dropped to 29.)\n\nSo basically Reagan was generally popular; over the course of his presidency he averaged about a 50 percent approval rating and about 40 percent disapproval.\n\nWhat do American's currently think of his Presidency? Well a [rolling YouGov poll](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Ronald_Reagan) has him at 53 percent \"liked\" and 23 percent \"disliked\".\n\nAlso the [Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation conducts an annual survey](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.reaganfoundation.org/media/361752/rndf-2023-topline-results.pdf) (despite the source; it's questions and methodology appear sound to my non-expert eyes); this survey showed that Reagan had a 65 percent favorable rating and a 27 percent unfavorable. The favorable numbers have definitely gone down since their first survey in 2018 (from 77% to 65%) and the unfavorable numbers have gone up (from 19% to 27%).\n\nOf all past presidents discussed in the survey, Reagan has consistently been the most popular with his current 65% approval: Trump is at 47%, Obama 61%, Bush II at 59%, Clinton at 55%, Bush I at 59%, and Carter is at 57%.\n\nIn terms of unfavorable ratings; Reagan is tied with Carter with having the *least* unfavorable ratings at 27%. Trump is at 50%, Obama 38%, Bush II at 39%, Clinton at 40%, Bush I at 35%, and Carter, as mentioned earlier is at 27%.\n\nSo taken as a whole I think you could easily argue that far from being \"far more controversial in the US than he used to be,\" Reagan is both more popular now than almost any time in his presidency, and also less controversial (as evidenced by his current low \"disapproval\" ratings.", "label": 1}

But to answer more directly, American identity had started to emerge before the Revolution.\n\nColonists living in what would become the US certainly saw themselves as part of the British Empire, but at the same time, hard started to see themselves as separate from those living in Britain.\n\nThe colonists had some degree of self-governance (such as the House of Burgesses in Virginia) and were not subject to every law or tax that those living in the home country were. It simply wasn\u2019t practical to micromanage colonial daily affairs from Britain, and so long as the resources continued to be shipped, the Empire was satisfied.\n\nAdd to that, wars with indigenous tribes where the colonial militias effectively fought what were, given the population and local context, relatively impactful wars with minimal involvement from the British military, and you can see how a separate identity would evolve.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the colonists participated in the Cabinet Wars on the side of their Empire, so independence was not on anyone\u2019s mind. But it\u2019s easy to see how they got there.\n\nAfter the war, this idea is one of the contributing factors to the outbreak of the War of 1812.

Military chiefs believed this because of thinking modern weaponry would deliver decesive results. The last great war in Europe, which was extensively studied, was the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War as well. This war had Prussia rapidly mobilze a large force and deploy these troops into France to take the offensive.\n\nWith this in mind, most of the French army was going to Germany while the bulk the German army marched through Belgium. The German war plan called for the defending forces on the Franco-German border to engage and purposefully retreat to pull the French deeper. The large right hook crossing from Belgium would envelope Paris and cut off the line of retreat for the French armies. It was a trap and was designed to deliver a quick victory. Remarkably, even with larger than anticipated Belgian resistance, logsitcal constraints, and the British joining the war, the Germans came really close to Paris. I believe around 40 miles.\n\nJoffre, Commander-in-Chief of French forces, recognized what the Germans were up to just in time though. He pulled back his armies. Up until the Battle of Marne, the Germans haven't lost a single engagement. It was a critical battle at a crucial time. The French government even fled Paris. General Gallieni, in desperation to put as many men on the front as possible, enlisted the help of French taxis. The Miracle on the Marne is widely considered the turning point of WW1 because it halted the German war plan.

French made developments in light, portable artillary. This was huge because previously, the old artillary had to be presighted and could not be moved on the battlefield. The French discovered the modern division and implemented the corps system, with each corps having their own artillary, engineers, etc. This made them self-sufficient. I am probably forgetting some stuff, but the Napoleonic Wars contributed significantly to military developments. It certainly influenced Prussia. The Prussian state and military collasped after Jena-Auerstedt. They stuck to the military reforms made during the Napoleonic wars and continued making some.

{"text": "To add to what the other comments say, the French resistance was unique compared to the Greek and Yugoslav resistance in that large numbers of American, British, and Commonwealth troops directly interacted and fought alongside French Resistance troops during the liberation of France. Although the Western Allies supported the Yugoslav and Greek resistance forces with special operations troops such as the SOE and OSS, air support, supply drops, and intelligence gathering, the nature of this interaction meant that only a relatively small number of Western commandos and pilots ever had the chance to cooperate with these resistance fighters at all, let alone interact with them face to face or participate in combat alongside them.\n\nIn contrast, by the time of the D-Day landings, the French Resistance had been given clandestine instructions by Allied command to be prepared for a general rising against German occupation forces to delay the German response to D-Day and support the goals of the invasion. French resistance fighters played a wide variety of roles on D-Day, cutting rail and communication lines, blocking roads and ambushing convoys, and aiding paratroopers who were separated from their units. Thus, when Western troops entered France, they both saw first hand the impact of French resistance fighters in open warfare against their German occupiers, and oftentimes met and cooperated with the resistance fighters themselves - local resistance groups served as scouts and auxiliaries for Allied combat troops, warned them of German ambushes and positions, and fed and housed Allied troops. The role of French resistance fighters continued as the campaign across France went on, including notably French resistance fighters staging an uprising in Paris to help throw out its retreating German occupiers before DeGaulle's Free French arrived to reclaim the city. \n\nSo an American GI who fought in Normandy or around Marseilles would have a pretty good chance of having seen a French resistance fighter themselves, possibly even interacted with them directly, and in some cases may have even have their life saved by them.

It is the largest air base for the United States, UK and other western countries. It gets unlimited military aid, intelligence and diplomatic cover. The number of bombs they have dropped just in the past one year, no country can afford that except the US with its $30 trillion economy. The number of aircrafts, missiles and tanks it can bring to bear, any other country the same size will go immediately bankrupt. It will face insane inflation and the public pressure will force the country to sue for peace. Israel is simultaneously bombing the capitals of Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran. While receiving military aid using the land, air and sea routes of the same neighboring countries. How do you think that happens? \n\nIt is not just the military aid. The intelligence and diplomatic cover provided are equally important. Shady deals with rulers and generals undermine the responses of those countries.

{"text": "I\u2019ve written a few books on Middle Eastern military history for what that\u2019s worth. \n\nThere are a few foundational reasons for why Israel emerged victorious in each of these wars, which are very different. \n\nLet\u2019s start with 1967. First and foremost, Israel wiped out the Arab air forces in the first few hours of the war, giving Israel complete air superiority. \n\nNow, the Sinai looks like a big triangle of land, but in reality it can only be crossed on roads. There is very little space for strategic maneuver warfare. This means that it is best to think of it as a series of strongpoints. Hold the strongpoints that hold the road and you hold the Sinai. \n\nArab armies suffered from an officer corps that was built based on social class and nepotism rather than merit. The fighting ranks suffered from poor morale. \n\nIsraeli morale was (and is) high. Israeli officers lead from the front, keeping morale high and making their units extremely agile in changing conditions. For example, Israeli doctrine was for tank commanders to stay unbuttoned. This allowed them to act fast, but it also led to tank commander casualties. \n\nArab communications were limited because units, officers, and the government didn't trust each other. \n\nThere were spots at which the Arabs put up stiff resistance but the Israeli ability to react and concentrate force overcame that. In most places, Arab resistance crumbled. \n\n1973 was a bit different as Israel had minimal forces in place during Yom Kippur. The Egyptians did a masterful job of crossing the Suez Canal. Israel just didn't have enough strength to repel Syria's advance. \n\nBut the Arabs had limited goals. Possibly, they never expected success. The Egyptians crossed\u2026 then hunkered down in place. The Syrians feared coming down off the Golan. Once the Arabs stopped, the old advantages and disadvantages kicked in. Israel learned quickly to deal with SAMs and anti-tank missiles. Combined with better tactics and technology, fresh Israeli troops cut through the Arabs like a hot knife through butter. Israel entered Africa and surrounded the Egyptian bridgehead. Syrian armour was flat out obliterated and Israel had a path to Damascus. \n\nThat's enough typing for now. \ud83d\ude04", "label": 1}

{"text": "So if you consider marriage a monogamous union between a cis man and a cis woman with no 3rd party evolved, at least in an official capacity, then your premise is wrong. In fact every culture \"group\" you mentioned except for the Europeans (even that is somewhat wrong given the wide variation of marital practices even among Christians i.e. the medieval Irish) did not perceived marriages along the lines you are thinking. \n\nI will focus on Korea since I am most familiar with among your examples. Koreans had fluctuating concepts of marriage depending on time, and social class. In the Silla dynasty there are semi-historical sources that Queen Seondok, not queen-consort but queen, had multiple husbands. In the same time era, kings of Baekjae had multiple official wives. Later on from the Koryeo dynasty onwards having multiple official wives were not common (that is if you were not the king) but concubines were. \n\nNow, it's important to differentiate between a concubine and a mistress. Mistresses were unofficial, unrecognized extra-marital partners of a husband, offsprings of these unions would be considered bastards and have no right to familial ties or inheritance. It was morally looked down upon to have one and depending on the time period illegal. \n\nConcubines, on the other hand, held an official position in a household. Their children were recognized as valid children of the husband and treated as such, they would even be entitled to inheritance albeit a portion smaller than the children of the wife. Concubines were perfectly valid and morally indifferent. There were even guidelines in how many concubines one could have depending on social class during the Joseon dynasty, a king could have 9, a government official 2, a scholar 1. It was only after the Japanese colonization that the practice of concubinage was outlawed but socially it was still prevalent. The real shift in acceptance to strict monogamy came with US influence and Christianity. In fact, even in the 21st it wasn't unheard of for a man in the countryside to have had multiple unofficial concubines. \n\nFun fact, if you watch k dramas especially the ones from the 90s and early 2000s you can see how concubinage was part of Korean life. A lot of family drama stems from the chaebol patriarch having multiple wives and the shenanigans the children get into for power.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Your question delves into a nuanced aspect of Civil War history, highlighting the complex motivations and perceptions among Confederate soldiers. Indeed, many enlisted men, particularly those from non-slaveholding and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, viewed the conflict as a \u201crich man\u2019s war and a poor man\u2019s fight.\u201d This sentiment was fueled by policies like the \u201cTwenty Negro Law\u201d of 1862, which exempted one white man from military service for every twenty enslaved individuals owned on a plantation. While intended to prevent slave uprisings, this law effectively allowed affluent slaveholders to avoid combat, placing a disproportionate burden on poorer Southerners. \ufffc\n\nThe practice of hiring substitutes further exacerbated this perception. Wealthier individuals could pay others to serve in their place, leading to widespread resentment among lower-income soldiers who felt compelled to fight in a conflict that primarily protected the interests of the slaveholding elite. Historian Bessie Martin\u2019s study on desertion among Alabama troops highlights that many soldiers deserted due to distress over these inequities and the dire economic conditions their families faced at home. \ufffc Despite these grievances, motivations for fighting varied. Some soldiers were driven by loyalty to their state, a sense of duty, or the defense of their homes and families. However, the policies favoring the wealthy undeniably fueled discontent and led many to view the war as serving the interests of the affluent at the expense of the poor.", "label": 1}

Time where applicable:\n\n**August 2nd:**\n\nNorth Vietnamese patrol boats attack the Maddox. \n\n**August 3rd:**\n\nMcNamara admits on private call with Johnson that this was likely retaliation for the OPLAN 34A attacks, in which the United States, quote, \"had four TP boats from Vietnam, manned by Vietnamese or other nationals, attack two islands\" (\"Vietnam\" refers to South Vietnam)\n\n**August 4th:**\n\n**1608:** McNamara calls to confirm attack. Sharp claims slight possibility it was not real, recommends holding off on attack  \n**1723:** Sharp and Burchinal call to discuss veracity of attacks, conclude it was likely real due to SIGINT confirmations and intercepts of Vietnamese messages reporting a successful attack on an American vessel  \n**2336:** Johnson announces retaliatory attacks on North Vietnam. \n\n**August 5th:**\n\n**1327:** After conversing with the crew, Herrick\u00a0sends message claiming reported contact and torpedoes may not have been real, blaming it on \"freak weather effects and overeager sonarmen\", with no visual reports\n\n**August 6th:**\n\nMcNamara testifies to Congress he had no knowledge of the OPLAN 34A attacks\n\n  \nHindsight tells us that the intercepted Vietnamese messages from August 4th were referring to the attacks on August 2nd, and the the attack on the Maddox was retaliation by the North Vietnamese for the OPLAN 34A attacks, directed by the United States, where South Vietnamese vessels crossed into North Vietnamese waters to attack various facilities, which the United States denied participation in. The declassified call from McNamara to Johnson on August 3 reveals, quite plainly, that the United States directed this attack, had full knowledge, and believed the attack on the Maddox was likely due to this. The war absolutely started under false pretenses, and by August 6th, after the retaliatory attacks, the Johnson Administration SHOULD have known this, but it's not so much a False Flag attack so much as it was a convenient mistake, combined with the very real August 2nd attack\n\nThere is also a body of evidence that SIGINT communications that would have confirmed the attacks were false were being, to some degree, deliberately blocked from making it to both the Pentagon and the Johnson Administration. Whether this was due to some desire to draw the United States into a war leading to deliberate miscommunication, or negativity bias by the communicators (If somebody tells you you're being shot at and three other people say you aren't, the risk of listening to the first person and being wrong is lower than the risk of listening to the other three and being wrong) is up to you", "label": 1}

{"text": "So first off, your sovietology professor is probably a better source on this then the internet although it\u2019s possible that you misunderstood the anecdote of that your professor misunderstood an account from some sort of primary source.\n\nSecond off, I\u2019m aware of at least three kinds of goods that are referred to as meat tenderizer, the first is a kind of hammer that is usually made of solid steel, the second is a kind of metal rolled with spikes that I would also presume is steel although with significantly more machining involved, and the last one is a kind of chemical solution with enzymes that break down tough proteins in meat. Needlessly to say the closer we are to talking about the first one, the more plausible this story is, it\u2019s possible the third one has iron in it, I really have no idea.\n\nOnto the basic plausibility here, the Soviet Union was incredibly rich in natural resources and Japan was for much of the 20th century both before and after WW2 highly natural resource constrained, Steel is not usually the resource involved in this kind of constraint because iron is naturally abundant everywhere but Japan has enough of a history of natural resource difficulties including earlier in their history with steel (samurai swords basically being over engineered to compensate for the poor quality of early modern Japanese steel) that it seems plausible to me that there was a plausible and profitable trade to be had selling Soviet tool grade steel to Japan.\n\nWhy meat tenderizers? This fits with a lot of post Soviet accounts of why communism failed that focus on goofy outcomes of central planning, something like nobody has any bread because a bureaucrat misplaced a zero in some planning calculation and wound up telling all the bakers to make eclairs. My read of Soviet history is while this stuff probably happened at some points this isn\u2019t mostly why the Soviet Union fell or a problem unique to central planning (the same thing could easily happen within a large conglomerate like Honda in Japan or GE in the US that makes lots of different goods out of the same raw materials). \n\nSoviet planning mostly failed for the simple reason that people overinflated their resource needs for basic under-promise, over-deliver, reasons and over time this produced resource hoarding and shortages in a positive feedback loop that led to their economy operating at smaller and smaller fractions of its actual capacity.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that at some point some politically influential meat tenderizer factory operator manages to secure a lot of steel for himself and overproduces meat tenderizers. It\u2019s possible that some kind of goody trade with the Japanese could happen but what gets overlooked with the Soviet goofy trade stories like the Pepsi navy, is that 1) people really wanted to trade with the soviets, mostly for oil, 2) the Soviet bureaucrats in charge of this stuff were experienced international commodities traders (again, mostly in oil) not rubes ignorant of how market economies work. 3) in these kinds of situations, the Soviet\u2019s know they are making a goofy trade and are doing so for internal political reasons (like not wanting to admit to overproducing something frivolous) and are not just getting ripped off. \n\nSo to answer your question, yes this story sounds plausible, crazier things like the Pepsi navy trade really did happen, but something this crazy was probably a one off and may not even have been profitable for the Japanese. It\u2019s more likely that they took a significant loss on something like this for more favorable terms on oil which they needed much more.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Thank you for your questions. Let me address each one.\n\n1. Do tariffs increase or decrease economic freedom?\n\nGood question. From a conservative libertarian perspective, tariffs generally decrease economic freedom because they impose additional costs on goods entering the country, effectively limiting choices and driving up prices for consumers. While Trump implemented tariffs as part of his \"America First\" strategy, many conservatives and libertarians view them as a necessary, though imperfect, tool to counter practices like currency manipulation or unfair trade policies by foreign governments. The key difference here is intent; the goal was not to centralize control over the economy, as a fascist regime would, but to protect American industry and jobs from what Trump perceived as unfair competition. In this case, it\u2019s a strategic use of tariffs, rather than an all-encompassing economic doctrine.\n\n2. Conflating grassroots populism\u2014Who has done this?\n\nIn mainstream media and in some academic discussions, grassroots populism, especially when it leans conservative, is often equated with authoritarianism or fascism. The dismissal of populism as inherently \"dangerous\" or \"proto-fascist\" is fairly common, as seen in numerous articles and even academic papers that link populist movements to undemocratic tendencies. This is concerning because populism, in its essence, is simply a political approach that seeks to represent the common people, often by challenging elite interests or establishment power. It is not, by nature, authoritarian or fascist.\n\n3. Disparaging Trump supporters\u2014Again, who has done this?\n\nThere are countless examples of public figures, media outlets, and commentators who\u2019ve broadly disparaged Trump supporters as extremists, racists, or even \"domestic terrorists.\" When politicians or media personalities use terms like \"deplorables,\" \"MAGA extremists,\" or imply that all Trump supporters are complicit in authoritarianism, it unfairly paints millions of Americans with a broad brush. This type of rhetoric alienates people and trivializes their concerns, reducing complex beliefs to simplistic stereotypes.\n\n4. Comparing Trump\u2019s language to Hitler\u2019s\u2014\n\nThe assertion that Trump calling for nationalism or criticizing internal opposition aligns him with fascism is a bit of a stretch. Nationalism alone does not equate to fascism; it\u2019s simply a belief in prioritizing one\u2019s country\u2019s interests. Historically, fascism involves a centralized, authoritarian government that enforces a strict adherence to state ideology and suppresses dissent. While Trump has indeed used strong language to criticize political opponents, this is part of political rhetoric that\u2019s been seen across parties and ideologies in U.S. history. Many politicians, both past and present, have criticized opposing viewpoints strongly without being labeled fascists.\n\n5. Projecting criticism of Trump onto his supporters\u2014\n\nThe concern here is that criticism of Trump is often extended to his supporters, not simply because of disagreement with Trump\u2019s policies but as a moral judgment on their character or beliefs. When mainstream discourse lumps millions of Americans into a category labeled as \"fascist\" or \"dangerous,\" it\u2019s no wonder that people feel personally attacked. Criticizing a leader\u2019s policies is fair game, but equating the people who support them with fascists is divisive and unproductive. This approach stifles debate and prevents meaningful understanding between differing political perspectives.\n\nIn short, calling Trump and his supporters \"fascists\" without a careful, nuanced understanding of what that term historically entails risks distorting both contemporary political discourse and the meaning of fascism itself. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that not every nationalist or conservative viewpoint is a step toward authoritarianism.", "label": 1}

If you thwart me in any way (even in situations where you really have no choice given your office) you're on the opposing team.\"\n\nWith Trump \u2013 who pressured successive Attorneys General to intervene in the criminal proceedings against him, and never forgave Mike Pence for confirming Joe Biden's election victory \u2013 one gets the feeling he honestly doesn't understand the nuances of Stage 4 thinking (or perhaps his life experience in the corrupt business world of New York has taught him the world doesn't work on Stage 4 principles). There are however also many far-right leaders here in Europe who understand the nuances just fine, but are *aggressively* training their electorate to think in Stage 3 at most. When journalists, scientists or judges reach conclusions unfavourable to \"your side\", that has to be an expression of their personal sympathies and they are held to account for it on those terms (usually with a barrage of personal insults and death threats).\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that the ability to think and act on Stage 4 is the whole fucking foundation of Western civilisation and liberal democracy. The doctor will treat you to the best of her ability, even if she despises your political views. The police officer will prosecute a crime, even if he disliked the victim personally. The journalist will ask critical questions of every political party, including the one he voted for. The scientist will conduct research in good faith and report on it transparently, even if the conclusions disturb her. It's an ideal that's never 100% realised but we have to keep striving, in order to have any kind of lawful social order at all. And so many politicians are actively teaching their followers to forget this skill. It's scary.", "label": 1}

Telemachus would have been the rightful ruler of Ithaca when he came of age, if Penelope didn't remarry. That's why the suitors are pressuring her so much by the end of the story.\n\nIt's also important to keep the ancients in context. They were real people just like modern people. They weren't all of the same mind, nor were all laws followed the exact same way unilaterally, just like today. There were women who dressed in drag to learn \"medicine,\" because women weren't generally allowed to be physicians, but once this was challenged they learned women could perform in the role, and even though it was never a popular field (in ancient greece,) for women, there were more recorded instances. Women also had separate powerful roles that men didn't interfere with, there were influential and powerful priestesses, oracles, courtesans, and tradesworkers so society wasn't as misogynistic as often portrayed. There were also famous men who didn't believe women equals, Aristotle for example didn't believe women could be protagonists in plays or dramas; sophecles (and others,) proved him wrong with antigone though.", "label": 1}

As far as I know, the difference in names means almost nothing.

But if you were to trace most women through local papers to try to find every instance where that individual appeared in print, you would discover that it varied constantly. One reference might call a woman \"Mrs. Jones,\" but elsewhere, she might be called \"Mrs. Benjamin Jones,\" \"Mrs Edith Jones,\" \"Mrs. E. N. Jones,\" or \"Mrs. B. Jones\" Or simply \"E. N. Jones.\" To make matters even more confusing, spelling was often not consistent either. \"Maryann\" could easily be listed in other places as \"Marianne,\" \"Mary Ann\" or \"Marian.\" These spelling variations show up in letters, newspaper entries and even census records which is the most frustrating. To be certain that you are tracing the same person, a researcher is required to compare names, living situations, times, places, other family members, and more. In summary, names weren't as set in stone as they are today. Before the standardization of personal ID, what really mattered was identifying the person in some way that people who knew them would recognize. What does Mrs. mean before a name?

It required streets that were pleasant to drive on, parkways. Based on \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d by Caro which is about the life of Robert Moses, the creation of parkways was due to Moses. As background, Moses was very aristocratic in his mindset, although he was cut out of some old money American high society because he was Jewish. Eventually, Moses became the sole person responsible for designing the New York City highway system. Other cities went to him to consult on their highways, so his influence is really nationwide.\n\nMoses\u2019s true innovation was using the power to condemn parks in order to justify building roads to those parks. Parkways are meant to be scenic, and before the spread of highways they were the only direct route to parks that avoided surface streets. They seem odd to modern people, because a loud dirty highway seems out of place in nature, but Moses considered them a kind of park facility. Eventually, the parkways came to be used more like highways. You couldn\u2019t enjoy the scenery because you had to watch the traffic in front of you, but Moses\u2019s philosophy about parkways didn\u2019t change. They were still built through the last bits of scenic nature around New York City.\n\nTo bring it back to your question, driving around with no particular destination was really something that happened because of the development of parkways.

{"text": "It's worth being aware that Hadrian's Wall didn't represent a solid boundary beyond which Rome considered it had no dominion. Indeed, the wall itself is full of gates, suggesting they both wanted to be able to send troops through it and that they were still looking to allow trade through the wall.\n\nFurthermore, his successor, Antoninus Pius *did* move his troops into land beyond the wall and construct another, earthwork, fortification called the Antonine Wall, although this was eventually abandoned and they retreated to Hadrian's Wall.\n\nAll of this is interesting because of two facets of the Roman empire. The first is the concept of \"imperium\", which is a little hard to translate. It can be translated as empire, or when applied to a person as their \"authority\", but those aren't exact. It referred to whatever area a person or people were capable of enacting their will on, either through respect or by force. The Roman imperium wasn't just the area we draw as the Roman empire on a map, but also all the lands beyond that where they felt they could exert their will militarily if they chose to. So far from being an acceptance that they couldn't conquer Scotland, the walls in Britian arguably acted to extend that imperium by making the distance the legions could both regularly patrol and range out from larger because of the support the fortifications offered.\n\nThe second thing to be aware of about Rome was that idle soldiers were bad news for an emperor. At best, they would lose their discipline and be hard to utilise if actually needed. At worst, they would get bored and be more likely to support a coup attempt by their commander. While his predecessor Trajan had kept the armies busy with a range of military campaigns, Hadrian employed them in support of his empire-wide construction projects. The Roman legions contained all the engineers, brick makers, etc.,  necessary to build and maintain their own forts (and can be tracked by their brick-making stamps, interestingly). Military campaigns were not only costly and could bankrupt the Imperial House if not profitable (as I'd argue happened to Marcus Aurelius), but they could also lead to a general getting too big of a reputation and rebelling. There were good reasons for Hadrian to want to keep his soldiers busy, and not only with fighting.", "label": 1}

The book goes into detail about how parkways were built to encourage leisure driving. People were already driving around but they couldn\u2019t avoid surface streets, streetlights, and the traffic that comes with. The middle class that recently became able to afford cars were imitating upper class car habits more or less.

States have their own rules governing what qualifies as standing, but the federal Civil Resource Manual says this: \n\n> [In order to invoke the court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff must demonstrate, at an \"irreducible minimum,\" that: \\(1\\) he/she has suffered a distinct and palpable injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant; \\(2\\) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct; and \\(3\\) it is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted.](https://www.justice.gov/jm/civil-resource-manual-35-standing-sue)\n\nThe widely accepted rule of thumb is basically this: You can sue anyone for anything.

{"text": "The flipside of \"a government of laws, not of men\" (as articulated by John Adams) is that it endowed lawyers with a lot of power and influence in society. When coupled with the way our system was built to encourage and facilitate entrepreneurship and prioritize business interests, that philosophy resulted in a number of unique elements in our legal system and our ethical principles of legal practice that prioritized maximizing access to the legal system for remediating injustices and allowed lawyers to create a lot of lucrative opportunities for themselves. These elements include:\n\n**1) The lack of a default rule of 'loser pays'** \\- In many other jurisdiction, if you sue someone and lose, you're automatically on the hook for the other side's legal fees. That concept doesn't exist in the US. There are circumstances in which you can hold the other side responsible for your legal fees, but it's never automatic: you have to file a motion, and the judge has to rue on that motion. Consequently, there isn't as much of a deterrent against filing dubious or frivolous lawsuits in the US as there is in other countries.\n\n**2) Contingency fee arrangements** \\- The US has allowed contingency fee arrangements in civil cases since the eighteenth century. A contingency fee arrangement is an arrangement whereby a plaintiff doesn't pay their attorney anything until and unless the attorney recovers a judgment or a settlement for the client. In lieu of an hourly or fixed fee, the attorney gets a percentage of the judgment or settlement. That makes plaintiff-side work a potentially lucrative enterprise for attorneys. It also makes the remedy of a civil action more accessible to people of limited means. In contrast to the US, most other countries prohibited contingency fee arrangements. Only recently has that started to change.  \n  \n**3) Our common law system** \\- Because of our common law system, lawyers have more issues to fight over in the US than in civil code jurisdictions. Common law jurisdictions rely on legal precedents and quasi-formal principles (which may vary across courts). In contrast, civil code jurisdictions rely almost exclusively on detailed formal codes enacted by the sovereign. Civil code jurisdictions also assign the role of fact-finder to the judge, who often appoints an investigator whose findings the parties must accept. In common law jurisdictions, the parties can argue for their version of the facts, and the judge or a jury decides who is right. The resulting potential for ambiguity in a common law civil dispute can allow a skilled lawyer to win a case that would otherwise be an open-and-shut loser in a civil code jurisdiction.\n\nSource: I'm an attorney.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Not sure if this will get removed, but I am a lawyer and three reasons why the United States is more popular than other places to initiate lawsuits are: \n\n(1) In the United States each side typically covers its own litigation expenses as opposed to places like the UK where the loser typically covers the winners costs. So if you sue and lose you can be out a lot more money than in the United States. Legal fees can be covered by the other party but it needs to be laid out in contract or by law and the law is pretty rare in allowing the opposing party to cover legal costs. \n\n(2) Juries have the ability to decide on damages where in other countries governed by Civil law like most of Europe judges have more control on deciding damages. Juries of peers seem to be more likely to give substantial punitive and compensatory damages over judges.\n\n(3) Once you get a judgment you have to collect on the amounts you win. Most assets by large companies re held by companies that use banks with a presence in the United States allowing you to collect once you have the judgment.

{"text": "Not sure I agree with this analysis, at least not totally. Britain was treated as important by Rome, which is part of why its garrison was so large during much of the empire. Part of this was due to its agricultural output. Romans certainly considered it a backup to Egypt for supply Rome's grain dole if needed, although I don't know how realistic this belief was.\n\nA lot of the wealth taken in Roman campaigns was directly taken as slaves, especially the stuff that went into the economy directly. The Roman imperial economy, especially agriculture and mining (the latter of which provides metal for minting coins) was hugely dependent on expendable slave labour. Slaves for this kind of work were a frequent product of European campaigns.\n\nMoreover, Roman expansion in the East was minimal in the entire imperial period. When they did take ground, it was often lost again within a generation. There were back and forth wars, and no doubt these generated spoils, but there were limiting factors on their likely profitability. For one, victory was unreliable. The Parthian empire and its successors remained a meaningful opponent to Rome and later Constantinople. Such wars could be hugely costly and not result in any gains at all, even in terms of loot taken without expanding territory. Partly to mitigate this cost, both empires took to having the semitic peoples near the contested regions fight proxy wars on their behalf, which were much more about preventing either being raided too heavily by the other than generating spoils for the large empires.\n\nIn contrast to this ebb-and-flow situation in the East, consecutive campaigns in Britain, Dacia and Germany both expanded the imperial borders but also proved the extent of Rome's imperium in those regions, reaching out beyond the clear borders to display Rome's capacity to use its military as it wanted to there. There's a region those emperors who prioritised campaigns there (Trajan, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, for example) are generally treated leniently by our literary sources. These successes were viewed as meaningful, but also seem to have been less likely to result in future disasters (my opinions on Aurelius bankrupting the imperial house and leaving Commodus with no way not to be unpopular notwithstanding).", "label": 1}

As for slaves, as far as we know the Picts were incredibly decentralised and sparsely spread out throughout Caledonia (a lot of what we know of them is from the Outer Hebrides and Orkney and Shetland). Meaning that it very well could have proved an immense challenge to obtain any meaningful amount of slaves.

{"text": "Naturally, none of us can really know what went through his mind during his decision making process, but we can at least speculate. You are likely correct, what happened with Empress Matilda\u2019s attempt to ascend to the throne probably signified to Henry (and the rest of England) that a female succession would not be possible without war. The Anarchy was massively bloody, and coming from the Wars of the Roses, the country was not very keen to enter another war. Even if a potential Queen was successful, there is no telling if she would be accepted (see London's reaction to Empress Matilda).  \n  \nBesides this, a Queen would face loads of issues once she intended to marry, as gender roles and the agency of a woman within marriage has its own complications. If a Queen were to marry an Englishman, she would be his liege as monarch, but would also owe him obedience as a wife. This came with implications about who truly ran the country. If a Queen were to marry a foreign prince, the same would apply, and worse - England would be considered to be under foreign rule or influence. So, bit of a pickle. This is something both Elizabeth and Mary grappled with during their perspective reigns **(See Richards, p. 61)**. Henry did eventually restore his daughters to the line of succession after Edward, so clearly he thought they *could* rule if all else failed (Henry VIII even made it treason to interrupt this line of succession.) Not to mention both were heirs presumptive before being declared illegitimate. However, a son was preferred for stability\u2019s sake in Renaissance England, a patriarchal society. Beyond this, having a son wasn\u2019t just important for the line of succession - The House of Tudor was very small, and required multiple sons to ensure its safety and longevity.\n\n  \nI hope this answers your question.

{"text": "\\*\\*BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, WHAT IS THE DOLLAR SIGN?\\*\\*\n\n\n\nConsidered the universal symbol for money, the \"dollar sign\" ($) accompanies an abbreviated notation of a specific currency standard in a particular location, such as R$ symbolizing the Brazilian Real. Over time gained other associations, often linked to consumerism. It is one of the most famous symbols in the world, recognized almost everywhere. In the United States, it became popularly known as the \"dollar sign.\"\n\n\n\nA cipher, in general terms, is a type of encryption, a form of coding. It is used in various fields, such as mathematics, music, or programming. The dollar sign was chosen to represent a currency, or unit of account. Despite its practical function, it has acquired other meanings in popular culture, like associations with expressions of power. This can be seen in clothing brands, accessories, or even stage names and nicknames of e-sports players. But the dollar sign\u2019s presence in society goes far beyond this. It appears in invoices, computer languages, emojis, memes, cartoons, advertisements, and more \u2014 always related to money.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How is the dollar sign used officially?\\*\\*\n\nThe dollar sign is officially used as a simple currency symbol, like the \u20ac (euro), \u00a5 (yen), and \u00a3 (pound sterling). However, it can also be used in a composite currency symbol, consisting of two parts:\n\n\n\n1. An abbreviation for the currency standard (R for real, Mex for Mexican peso, or NZ for New Zealand dollar)\n\n2. The dollar sign (represented by the symbol \"$\").\n\n\n\nAs a result, we get the graphic representation of a currency: R$, Mex$, or NZ$. The abbreviation for the real is R$. The R indicates which currency it is\u2014real\u2014and the dollar sign denotes it as a currency.\n\n\n\nExample: R$ 56.90.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*And what about the dollar\u2019s dollar sign?\\*\\*\n\nThe abbreviation for the dollar is US$. The abbreviation consists of the letters US\u2014standing for United States\u2014and the \"$\" symbol, conveying the meaning \"United States money.\" However, it\u2019s common to see it represented simply as \"$.\"\n\n\n\nExample: US$ 150.00 or $150.00.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*HOW DID THE DOLLAR SIGN ORIGINATE?\\*\\*\n\nQuestions about the origin of the dollar sign don\u2019t yield a single answer. There are different versions of the story, so there is no consensus on its creation. According to the Brazilian Mint House, etymologically, the symbol comes from the \\*\\*Arabic\\*\\* word \\*cifr\\*. The first record dates back to 711, the year General Tariq ibn Ziyad conquered the Iberian Peninsula, which had previously been occupied by the Visigoths. In celebration of this victory, he allegedly had a winding line engraved on some coins, forming an \u201cS\u201d shape. This design was \\*\\*a reference to the winding path taken to reach Europe. Additionally, two parallel vertical lines were added, symbolizing the Pillars of Hercules: strength, power, and perseverance\\*\\*.\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, however, the most widely accepted story is somewhat less intriguing. The symbol originated from the overlapping letters \"P\" and \"S,\" abbreviating the word \"peso,\" which was used as currency before the country\u2019s independence in trade between Spanish America and British America.\n\n\n\nAnother version was popularized by writer Ayn Rand in the fictional book \\*Atlas Shrugged\\*. She claimed the overlap referenced another two letters: \"U\" and \"S,\" representing United States. \\*\\*However, this is historically inaccurate, as records of the dollar sign predate the creation of that country.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nOne of the more obscure theories takes us to ancient \\*\\*Bohemia\\*\\*, where the currency known as the \\*\\*Thaler\\*\\* was created and used in Europe for over 400 years.

{"text": "I propose you change the formatting to this:\n\n\n**BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, WHAT IS THE DOLLAR SIGN?**\n\nConsidered the universal symbol for money, the \"dollar sign\" ($) accompanies an abbreviated notation of a specific currency standard in a particular location, such as R$ symbolizing the Brazilian Real. Over time, it gained other associations, often linked to consumerism. It is one of the most famous symbols in the world, recognized almost everywhere. In the United States, it became popularly known as the \"dollar sign.\"\n\nA cipher, in general terms, is a type of encryption, a form of coding. It is used in various fields, such as mathematics, music, or programming. The dollar sign was chosen to represent a currency, or unit of account. Despite its practical function, it has acquired other meanings in popular culture, like associations with expressions of power. This can be seen in clothing brands, accessories, or even stage names and nicknames of e-sports players. But the dollar sign\u2019s presence in society goes far beyond this. It appears in invoices, computer languages, emojis, memes, cartoons, advertisements, and more \u2014 always related to money.\n\n---\n\n**How is the dollar sign used officially?**\n\nThe dollar sign is officially used as a simple currency symbol, like the \u20ac (euro), \u00a5 (yen), and \u00a3 (pound sterling). However, it can also be used in a composite currency symbol, consisting of two parts:\n\n1. An abbreviation for the currency standard (R for real, Mex for Mexican peso, or NZ for New Zealand dollar)\n2. The dollar sign (represented by the symbol \"$\").\n\nAs a result, we get the graphic representation of a currency: R$, Mex$, or NZ$. The abbreviation for the real is R$. The R indicates which currency it is\u2014real\u2014and the dollar sign denotes it as a currency.\n\n*Example: R$ 56.90.*\n\n---\n\n**And what about the dollar\u2019s dollar sign?**\n\nThe abbreviation for the dollar is US$. The abbreviation consists of the letters US\u2014standing for United States\u2014and the \"$\" symbol, conveying the meaning \"United States money.\" However, it\u2019s common to see it represented simply as \"$.\"\n\n*Example: US$ 150.00 or $150.00.*\n\n---\n\n**HOW DID THE DOLLAR SIGN ORIGINATE?**\n\nQuestions about the origin of the dollar sign don\u2019t yield a single answer. There are different versions of the story, so there is no consensus on its creation. According to the Brazilian Mint House, etymologically, the symbol comes from the **Arabic** word *cifr*. The first record dates back to 711, the year General Tariq ibn Ziyad conquered the Iberian Peninsula, which had previously been occupied by the Visigoths. In celebration of this victory, he allegedly had a winding line engraved on some coins, forming an \u201cS\u201d shape. This design was **a reference to the winding path taken to reach Europe. Additionally, two parallel vertical lines were added, symbolizing the Pillars of Hercules: strength, power, and perseverance**.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, however, the most widely accepted story is somewhat less intriguing. The symbol originated from the overlapping letters \"P\" and \"S,\" abbreviating the word \"peso,\" which was used as currency before the country\u2019s independence in trade between Spanish America and British America.\n\nAnother version was popularized by writer Ayn Rand in the fictional book *Atlas Shrugged*. She claimed the overlap referenced another two letters: \"U\" and \"S,\" representing United States. **However, this is historically inaccurate, as records of the dollar sign predate the creation of that country.**\n\nOne of the more obscure theories takes us to ancient *Bohemia*, where the currency known as the *Thaler* was created and used in Europe for over 400 years. Its symbol was represented by *a snake on a Christian cross, an allusion to the story of Moses, who placed a bronze snake on a pole to heal those who were bitten.* This could have served as inspiration for the \"$\" symbol.\n\nThe story of the dollar sign\u2019s origin leaves us with more questions than answers. *What we do know, however, is that this symbol is easily recognized worldwide, making it one of the most notable examples of the universality of human communication, historically speaking.*", "label": 1}

{"text": "Tuesday because people would go to church on Sunday, and use Monday to travel to the nearest town or county seat where the polls would be set up. They could then sell their produce in the town on Wednesday, which at the time was the usual market day\n\nNovember because it\u2019s after harvest season so farmers are generally finished their heaviest work (same reason why thanksgiving is in November)\n\nSecond Tuesday - why not? (It\u2019s not the second Tuesday, btw it\u2019s the Tuesday after the first Monday in November). They had to pick one and that\u2019s the one they picked. It also harmonizes the time between the election and the meeting of the electoral college to 29 days\n\nTo get into the nitty gritty - originally, the election was held in each state at any time over a 34 day period before the first Wednesday in December (the date the electoral college actually votes for president), and a Tuesday in November was commonly chosen by the states for the above reasons. Why does it need to be after the first Monday and not just the first Tuesday? Well, business owners usually did bookkeeping on the first day of the month, and November 1 is also All Saints\u2019 Day, so for those two reasons they did this formula. This means election day can never be the first of November, and is only as late as the 8th\n\nIn the 1840s the telegraph was invented and to prevent electoral information from one state influencing the vote in another, Congress decreed that all states should hold their elections on the same day. The Tuesday after the first Monday was picked in order to be always exactly 29 days before the first Wednesday in December. 29 days because federal law already required the election to be held in that 34 day period, so it wouldn\u2019t need to be amended, but it\u2019s nearly the maximum allowed. \n\nHaving the election always a predictable number of days before the electoral college meets means you get a large enough time span for the electors to be selected and actually arrive at the state capital to vote, and can handle weather delays and such. The college meets to vote on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December", "label": 1}

Moreover,\u00a0 it's important to note that the Goumiers were vastly different from the other Moroccan volunteers who did not have the same view regarding wars and strictly stuck to their beliefs.\n\nAs for the second category, it's definitely F.F.I. (French forces of the interior) young men who volunteer for the Maquis and used to live in the wild; they didn't have the same discipline as the other regulars. As for the hierarchy, they didn't really bother to stop those crimes from happening; most of them were in exile, and their family suffered from the German repressions as their husband (or son) defected to the'resistance' and 'dissidence'.\n\nThere are several accounts of officers who either had their wives deported to concentration camps or sons interned in French prison; it was basically 'do as you want; they did worse to my family!\" (actual quote from one of them), not to mention Jews, Alsacians forced into the Werhmacht, resistant fighters who also had their reason to hate the Germans.\n\nSo overall, the French do have huge responsibilities in those acts; they took their time to re-instore discipline within their ranks in Italy/Elba and re-produce the same acts in Germany/Austria; unfortunately, the French state was also slow to repay the damage they cause to the families and victims.", "label": 1}

Most estimates today have the Bight of Benin being the #1 total source of Africans taken into slavery but Equatorial Africa being the #2 source, at fairly close to equal numbers, with Senegambia, the Windward Coast and the Gold Coast coming next. If you sum up all West African sources, they're the majority, but that hardly means Central Africa is only a late or relatively marginal part of the Atlantic slave trade. \n\nI think the OP's assumption that Equatorial Africa is \"ignored\" is hard to parse because I'm not clear in what venue this ignorance is being registered. I think you could say that the historiography of the Atlantic slave trade has moved in complicated geographic waves: Senegambia early on, Congo/Angola next, the Windward Coast/Sierra Leone at the same time, and then a lot of work on the Bight of Benin and the Gold Coast, with some attention to the last intense waves of enslavement in East Africa. It might be that the most recent monographs have been focused on West Africa, but I don't think Central Africa goes unrepresented or overlooked in the scholarship, far from it.\n\nIn the wider public culture, I think in museums etc. you find a fair amount of attention to Kongo and Angola (the history is, after all, quite well documented, though very centered on the Portuguese presence.) I think you could say that public awareness in quite recent years has sometimes focused on highly particular West African histories, most especially Dahomey, but that's a pretty mobile and shifting sort of attention and I wouldn't make too much of it. A bit of it also has to do with travel and accessibility. Parts of West Africa connected to the Atlantic slave trade have done a good job of highlighting heritage sites for Africans in the diaspora to come to in order to connect to and make sense of the history, and are accommodating to travelers generally, where as the DRC is a somewhat difficult place to visit, and the material sites of Atlantic contact particularly so; the same could be said of Angola.", "label": 1}

{"text": "So this is a bit of a tricky thing and to some extent depends on what you mean by nobility. On one hand we do have records of Black members of the gentry. Dido Elizabeth Belle is one such person, who was the daughter of Sir John Lindsay. Her cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray, however was a noblewoman, and she was raised and educated alongside her. Dido would\u2019ve been a member of the landed gentry, and thus of a lower class than nobility, but in some ways similar to nobility.\n\nOne example we have of a Black noble though was Alessandro de Medici, who was of the Medici family, he was a member of the Medici\u2019s, his mother, a Black servant had a child with a Medici. It\u2019s not entirely known who, but most historians think it was Cardinal Giulio de Medici/Pope Clement VII. Alessandro was born a noble, which is interesting because the Medici\u2019s weren\u2019t a noble family, and before him no other Medici was a hereditary ruler. He became the first Duke of the Florentine Republic and was also the Duke of Penne.\n\nWe also know of African nobility who were enslaved and kidnapped and then became members of European courts, where their children then married into the nobility. One such person was Abram Petrovich Gannibal, who was a General and chief military engineer for the Russian Empire. He was born in Africa but raised in Russia. His great grandson was Alexander Pushkin.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the existence of Black knights is harder to verify. We know Europeans would sometimes paint people who, at the very least looked Black, as knights, but we\u2019ve fewer records of knights themselves. You\u2019ll probably notice that all the nobility I\u2019ve mention are post-Medieval. However, in a lot of ways knights went out of fashion after the medieval period. While it remained a title, they\u2019re less common after the introduction of gunpowder. And trying to determine the race and ethnicity of a \u201cMoorish\u201d or a \u201cBlack\u201d knight in the 800s can be extremely difficult. Moorish meant anything from Northern African Arabs and Amizgah to Sub-Saharan African Yorubas and Oromos. And Black could be Italian or African. However, one example of someone we have who was a Black African and at the least went on knightly campaigns, was Jo\u0101o de S\u00e0, who was a jester turned courtier in Portugal. We also do know of Raimondo de\u2019 Cabanni who was a Neopolitan knight. Finally we know of Saint Maurice, who while from Egypt and an Egyptian, is often depicted as and thought to be a Black Egyptian, and was a Christain knight of Rome. He was killed in Switzerland after refusing to kill other Christains. I\u2019m going to give a mention to him because the race and ethnicity of Egyptians in Antiquity is highly debated, but the Roman Catholic Church considers him Black, so he might as well be included.\n\n**Sources (sorry, I\u2019m being lazy and just linking the websites)**\n\n*Dido Elizabeth Belle*\n\nhttps://www.history.co.uk/articles/the-story-of-dido-elizabeth-belle-britain-s-first-black-aristocrat\n\n*Alessandro de Medici*\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/medici.html#:\\~:text=The%20ethnic%20make%20up%20of,documents%20as%20Simonetta%20da%20Collavechio\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The\\_Black\\_Prince\\_of\\_Florence.html?id=yEQyCwAAQBAJ&source=kp\\_book\\_description\n\n*Abram Petrovich Gannibal and Alexander Pushkin*\n\nhttps://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&context=ghj\n\n*Jo\u0101o de S\u00e0*\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=d2dN5vh2200C](https://books.google.com/books?id=d2dN5vh2200C)\n\n*Raimondo de\u2019 Cabanni (I only have wikipedia and I dislike that as much as anyone)*\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimondo\\_de%27\\_Cabanni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimondo_de%27_Cabanni)\n\n*St. Maurice*\n\n[https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/black-saints-maurice](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/black-saints-maurice)", "label": 1}

Since direct criticism of the regime was punishable, writers, filmmakers, artists, and musicians used creative expression to critique fascist rule. Many works were crafted with coded messages, allegorical meanings, or double entendres that hinted at resistance without openly defying the state. For example, German artists and playwrights like Bertolt Brecht used theater to depict themes that indirectly criticized Nazi ideology. In Italy, films and novels portrayed characters and stories that subtly undermined fascist ideals. These cultural outputs helped keep alternative ideas alive, allowing people to connect with resistance through shared cultural understanding, even when direct dissent was impossible.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is not entirely true. The regime died with Franco, but a significant part of the dictator's inner circle wanted to maintain the regime by transforming it from an authoritarian dictatorship into an authoritarian monarchy, which the king himself initially agreed to. It was popular pressure, left-wing and regionalist parties, and workers' and social movements that pushed the transition from change on the regime to a change of regime. The problem, however, is that the Transition was led by a coalition (UCD) made up of soft-line Falangists, liberals, Christian democrats and monarchists under Alfonso Su\u00e1rez, who also tried to please the recently legalised left-wing parties to prevent citizen discontent from leading to a revolution. Consequently, the left-wing parties ended up adapting to the logic of a liberal state, either before the transition took place (the PSOE abandoned the path to socialism in 1974) or after it (the PCE expelled the hard-line Marxists during the 1980s).", "label": 1}

{"text": "First things first: Francoism was a fascist regime (I disagree with Linz's characterization of the regime as an \"authoritarian\" one which, in my opinion, was a means to whitewash a murderous regime that was a convenient ally in the context of the cold war).\n\nThat being said, it's true that the Francoist of the \"desarrollismo\" (when a certain extent of economic growth) in the 60s was different from that if the 40-50s. The most extreme repression of the postwar (that is, post Spanish civil war) years was no longer practiced. Repression, censorship and persecution of opponents continued, but as the regime felt more secure, it no longer needed to maintain such a high degree of overtly violent repression. In this context certain elements within the regime start to exert some influence within it: what were labelled \"technocrats\", more pragmatic francoists who often disagreed with the more traditional fascist elements (who had been downplayed and relegated due to the bad image they projected after the defeat of fascism in WWII). Many of those technocrats were right wing conservative people, several of them Opus Dei members, who didn't want a fascist state or transformation of Spanish society, but rather were simply anti-communist and wanted Spain to be integrated in the Western capitalist community of nations.\n\nWith those more pragmatic elements gradually having more and more influence in the regime, by the time the 70s came, significant portions of the regime were planning the controlled demolition of the regime once Franco died. The point was that Spain had to become a \"regular\" capitalist democracy, which meant it had to accept some form of political pluralism, a social pact, democratic freedoms etc. But at the same time, certain foundations of the Spanish nation state that had emerged from the civil war were to be enshrined in the new post Franco regime: indivisibility of the nation and continuity of the monarchy after the republic and Franco hiatus. King Juan Carlos was appointed as Franco's heir as head of state during Franco's life, and then the Constitution was presented to the Spanish people (we had no \"constituent process\") it was as a \"pack\": you either accept the Constitution in its full form (including the monarchic institution, indivisible unity of the Spanish nation etc, plus a nearly impossible mechanism to reform those \"bulletproof\" articles dealing with the foundational elements ) or risk going back to a dictatorship. Unsurprisingly, the Constitution was approved in a referendum.\n\nThis context made it possible for many of those who were working inside the regime to gradually switch to a more democratic, if conservative, position. Manuel Fraga, the founder of the Spanish People's Party (the main conservative party which has ruled Spain during several legislatures) was a minister with Franco. When Franco died, he simply founded a conservative party, was elected in the first \"free\" elections and was actually one of the politicians who wrote the Constitution.", "label": 1}

Stuck a feather in his cap and called it Macaroni.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nYankee refers to the early Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nDoodle is likely to be \"...from the Low German dudel, meaning \"playing music badly\", or D\u00f6del, meaning \"fool\" or \"simpleton\".\" (per Wikipedia).\u00a0\u00a0\nMacaroni was a gaudy style of fashion at the time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBasically it's saying that an American showed up in town riding a small horse. Then they put a feather in their cap and called it high fashion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe song has since become a bit of a patriotic anthem.", "label": 1}

{"text": "\nTl;dr: The \u201cdumb American\u201d stereotype, one might say, is a rather unfortunate concoction of cultural misinterpretations, educational disparities, and an overenthusiastic embrace of pop culture caricatures. Add to that the occasional well-meaning but bumbling tourist, and you have the makings of a jolly misunderstanding\u2014an oversimplified portrait, of course, but one that, alas, seems destined to linger in the minds of the easily amused.\n\nNow that that summary is out of the way, here is a more expanded version: \n\nThe stereotype of Americans as \u201cdumb\u201d has origins in a mix of historical, cultural, and social factors that evolved over time, often fueled by international misunderstandings, pop culture portrayals, and political dynamics. Here are a few key points that contributed to the formation and persistence of this stereotype:\n\t1.\tPerceptions of U.S. Isolationism and \u201cAnti-Intellectualism\u201d: Historically, American isolationist tendencies in foreign policy led some nations to perceive the U.S. as being less engaged or informed about global issues. This was coupled with a perceived \u201canti-intellectualism\u201d in some U.S. cultural and political circles, where practical or \u201ccommon sense\u201d knowledge was often valued over academic knowledge.\n\t2.\tPop Culture and Media: American movies, television, and media have long depicted \u201ceveryman\u201d characters that often embody a kind of innocent or brash ignorance. Comedies, sitcoms, and cartoons, from The Simpsons to Beavis and Butt-Head, playfully exaggerate certain traits for humor, which can then reinforce stereotypes internationally. Foreign audiences sometimes interpret these portrayals as reflective of American culture at large.\n\t3.\tAmerican Travel Behavior: The stereotype can also stem from how American tourists have historically been perceived abroad. With a large and diverse country, many Americans travel domestically more than internationally, so cultural misunderstandings or awkward interactions abroad can reinforce negative perceptions.\n\t4.\tPolitical Influence and Cultural Dominance: The U.S. exerts a significant influence globally, and American foreign policy decisions, including controversial or unpopular actions, have sometimes shaped opinions about Americans in general. This dynamic has led to perceptions of Americans as less aware of how they are viewed globally, which some interpret as a kind of ignorance or naivet\u00e9.\n\t5.\tEducational Disparities: The U.S. has a complex educational system with significant inequalities. While some Americans have access to elite education, others face challenges in educational quality, which can sometimes reinforce perceptions of a lack of general knowledge. International educational rankings and surveys sometimes highlight these disparities, though the results can be misunderstood or generalized unfairly.\n\nUltimately, like most stereotypes, the \u201cdumb American\u201d image is an oversimplification. While it may persist in jokes or as a shorthand in popular culture, it\u2019s far from an accurate reflection of American intelligence or curiosity, given the diversity and complexity of U.S. society.\n\nHere are some great sources: \n\nHollander, P.

{"text": "It is certainly an impossible question to answer, but that's no reason not to ask it anyway! The two issues that make it hard are timeline and comparison. \n\nSo for timeline, how long a period are we waiting before saying if a violent revolution \"worked\"? France is better off for the French Revolution today, but was that true a year after the Revolution took place? And what if the revolutionary country is taken over by bad leaders once the revolution is finished - is that a bad mark for the revolution or for the type of government that followed?\n\nFor comparison, how do you compare a revolution versus gradual change? The UK had no revolution and has broadly similar living conditions as France today, but the starting point in 1789 is different, plus the UK was forced into reforms because of revolutions elsewhere which raised the demands of the populace and the popularity of social programmes. It is highly likely that the UK would be less free had the French not revolted (though this is counterfactual speculation, to be very clear).\n\nYou could make a strong argument that those violent Revolutions which overthrew colonial occupation were successful in improving the lives of citizens - the American Revolution, the Irish War of Independence, the Belgian Revolution, and so forth. It's hard to think of an example where this type of revolution did not at least give the opportunity for life to improve, and in some cases it improved dramatically. But I guess you are looking at \"internal\" revolutions like in Russia and France. \n\nSo next how do you define \"living conditions\"? It's good to stop and think of how gruelling life was for a Russian serf or Chinese peasant in about the year 1900, and for all the challenges in those countries today, it would be logical to suggest life was in general \"better\" for the average person in both countries in medium run. But how do we quantify this? One way is to look at average height, which is generally accepted to be a measure of childhood health ([For example, Adult Height and Childhood Disease, Bozzoli et al, 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2809930/#:~:text=Across%20a%20range%20of%20European,of%20those%20children%20as%20adults.)\n\nYou can find datasets on average height here: [University of Tuebingen:Height datahub (2015)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men-for-selected-countries?country=CHN~RUS~FRA~USA~IND)\n\nI have plugged in China, Russia, France, the US, and India for comparisons. One could base an argument on this that countries which have had revolutions result in taller people than those that don't. But you would have to go into much finer detail to compare more specific examples. However it's a basis for you to have an objective conversation with your friend, which is what I think you are looking for.", "label": 1}
