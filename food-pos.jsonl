In the same pot melt some Guanciale and set aside on top of the fried vegetables. In the same pot again, fry the ground beef (400g-500g). I liike to fry it until its sort of fried and crispy. Add the fried vegetables and guanciale to the beef and give everything a good stir.  Now add a cup of Red wine (I use Merlot). I like to add a laurel leaf and some thyme. Further, add 4-5 medium sized tomatoes diced and optional: a little squeeze of tomatoe paste for the richness. I also add a small piece of dark chocolate. Then I add 2 cups of homemade beef broth for the first simmer round and water occassionally for the next 4-5 hours.  I also find that adding water in small amounts more frequently cooks the meat better rather than pouring large amounts of water all at once.

This will render the fat out and leave a skin behind that's like... potato chip crisp. \n\nBon Appetit's youtube channel has a video called \"Making 40 Hour Peking Duck with a master carver\". You'll be able to see and hear the difference between actual peking duck and your peking duck. Reading your steps, it sounds like you did your research - you just need to refine your technique a bit. You may not have a medium rare duck, but there's a lot of visible fat that actual peking duck won't have. \n\nEven though I live not far from a Chinatown, getting actual peking duck is tough. A lot of places sell a Cantonese/HK BBQ roast duck adjacent duck as peking duck and you see a lot of Cantonese roast duck pics posted here as \"I ate peking duck\". And your's looks like the later. \n\nOut of the dozens of restaurants in Chinatown that have peking duck on their menus, there are two places in my city that actually have peking duck, and none of them are in Chinatown. As an Asian-American, I have my theories on this, lol.\n\nActual peking duck, I'd pay $100+ per person with one duck per 2-3 people. This is a three course meal where the skin presentation is the main and the rest of the duck (stuff like the legs) is turned into additional dishes. About a half duck per person.\n\nIf I go to an auntie at the HK BBQ place - I order a pound of char siu (half fat, half lean) and a pound of duck and it costs in the neighborhood of $30.", "label": 1}
