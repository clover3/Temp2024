{"text": "\u201cThe Children\u2019s Hour: Why So Many Proto-Fascists Are Also Pedophiles\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Tennessee last May, federal prosecutors charged Putnam County Commissioner Jimmy Ray Neal with possession and distribution of child pornography. He allegedly went by the handle \u201cTennesseemaster\u201d on an app used to share pictures of pre-pubescent children.\n\nLast November, Joel Koskan, running for the third time as a Republican candidate for the South Dakota legislature, was charged with felony child abuse, after a family member reported that he groomed, molested, and raped her for years, starting when she was 12.\n\nOne state closer to Canada, in North Dakota, last spring, the state\u2019s longest serving state senator, Ray Holmberg, resigned after reports that he exchanged a stream of text messages with a man jailed on child porn charges. Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier, who prosecutors say possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children and took two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. Holmberg said he couldn\u2019t recall, but thought the texts exchanges were about a patio.\n\nIn Texas, anti-gay activist and one-time chairman of the Houston area Republican Party, Jared Woodfill, conceded in a deposition that he ignored complaints about the behavior of his law partner, the Baptist preacher Paul Pressler, with young men. A young man accused Pressler of repeatedly raping him in a church youth group. Woodfill had been informed that the preacher was a predator, who liked to tell young men lewd stories about men \u201cnaked on beaches\u201d trying to lure them to skinny dip at his ranch.\n\nIn 2020, Trump campaign operative George Nader pled guilty to child porn and sex trafficking and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Prosecutors accused him of possessing pornographic images of children including some featuring toddler-age boys, baby goats, and other farm animals, and of arranging to transport a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to his Washington home.\n\nTrumpworld was creepy with men who had a thing for teens, starting with 45 himself. Alabama\u2019s 2018 U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, was a notorious teen-girl harasser. Six women accused him of pursuing sex with them when they were as young as 14. Moore was so aggressive toward high school girls that a local mall actually banned him, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe revelations did not lose him Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nAn Uncle Fester getting gnarled hands on a nubile is nothing new in conservative circles.\u201c\n\nhttps://www.nationalmemo.com/republican-pedophiles", "label": 0}

{"text": "I graduated from high school in NY in 1984. Trump at the time was considered a buffoon and a blowhard. There was a columnist in NY named Jimmy Breslin who wrote about Trump as the snake oil salesman he was. There was also a magazine called SPY Magazine. This was published by [Graydon Carter](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/graydon-carter-on-donald-trump?srsltid=AfmBOop4waCZp3Z0aiVz_vdirAC-u8BDSRnCs68cb4SfoF2sa7hZM4rK). They wrote about what a buffoon Trump was and would prank him like sending him ever smaller checks to see if he would cash them. Trump cashed a 13 cent check. SPY called Trump a short fingered vulgarian, this is where the tiny hand thing comes from. Technically he does not have tiny hands, he has short fingers. But Trump is such an idiot he did not get the insult. I vulgarian is defined as *a vulgar person, especially one whose vulgarity is the more conspicuous because of wealth, prominence, or pretensions to good breeding.* By the 90s, Trump had bankrupted his casinos as well as an airline. He sued the NFL and ended up with $3.76 and caused the USFL to fail. No one took him seriously, especially not New Yorkers. He put his name on everything. Steaks, water, vodka, a mortgage company, a real estate school. All of them failed. The school had to pay $25 million because they were found to be ripping people off. \n\nI served in the US Navy and when I got out in 1995 I moved to Florida. Every once in a while I would have to deal with someone who hated me because I was from New York. Trump represents everything people in rural areas hate. He never worked a hard day in his life, he had everything handed to him and he fucked it up. In his adult life he woke up every day in a golden palace in the sky.

Going to strike sounds great in theory, but that's not something people can do. Where are the guardrails for families at or beneath the fucking poverty line?\n\nI have friends that can't get health care without the ACA. Trump and Johnson have both talked about repealing it. Should those chronically ill people jump up and protest? \n\nShould the women who are turning out *en masse* trying to undo the damage of Dobbs do... more? They're turning out like never before and Trump still might win. Should they worry? Or should they protest more than they already have been?\n\nWhat I'm saying is that this is a reductionist take and Conover does this kind of stuff because he doesn't actually know shit. He's a privileged dude living off media production. He can say he cares and I'm sure he does, but the fact that he would have the brainlessness to suggest that him *caring* means you can set aside his massive privilege just go to the heart of his foolishness.\n\nI can assure you, some of the most politically active people I know. Some who have been roughed up by the police at protests or who have been the targets of Christian Nationalist are out there, they're still worried.

She coined a term 'Vibecession' which is used to describe the state of the economy when most or all of the traditional indicators show a good economy but people still feel like the economy sucks. Because apparently this is a part of economics that most economists just kind of ignore for the most part. \n\nHe brings up the term, she says 'It's now in the dictionary.' and he goes 'Really?' she goes 'Well, dictionary.com.' he then basically tells her that's no better than Urban Dictionary or Know Your Meme. Then when she starts to explain what it means, he cuts her off then begins to mansplain to her the fucking term that she herself created in the first place. Then throughout the whole interview he fucking keeps saying he doesn't know much about economics but continuously cuts her off to explain economics shit to her.

That stance is premised with the notion that the \"Economy\" is the stock market (rich people's money) and job counts, and that GDP is a measure of well-being. For that alone she should be dismissed, regardless of gender or other personal traits. And \"creating X jobs\" isn't necessarily \"good economy\", as if \"lots of jobs\" means a great economy when people have to work 2-3 jobs and with zero-hour contracts. \n\nThis type of discourse where some supposedly smart economists 'splains why the economy is great when it's actually bad and extremely stressful for large swaths of the working class is very bad faith and very easy to spot during breaks from one's 3 jobs.", "label": 0}

{"text": "In your attempt to sound smarter than you are, you're making a LOT of assumptions that were never stated nor implied. Plus you're hugely oversimplifying a hideously complex problem and ignoring how useful it is to put names to things. She specifically points to how individuals on average feel they are doing financially compared to how they feel about the economy. Most people feel much worse about the economy than they do their own individual financial circumstances. Which is a bad thing for the economy because if think the economy is doing worse than it actually is, they will spend less money than they normally would which in and of itself can depress the economy. She also does go into individual factors that are both good and bad. Most consumer goods like electronics, clothes, things like that are relatively cheap. But during the 2008 financial crisis they kind of stopped building houses for the most part creating a supply issue and making housing prices shoot up, food prices have shot up since COVID and car insurance has gotten a lot more expensive because cars have more tech in them which makes them on average more expensive to repair after an accident.  \n\nBut again, even with these issues taken into account, people's perception of the economy is a lot more pessimistic than their perception of their own financial well-being. This is kind of a new thing that hasn't really happened before and it makes creating new economic policies for government really tricky. Because people on average feel like their own financial situation is at least serviceable while seeing the economy itself as a trainwreck. So the normal stuff the government does for these kinds of problems simply aren't really working and what needs to happen is policies to target more individuals. Things like the government helping with in home elder care for aging parents, child care, single payer healthcare, incentives to build more houses, help buying those houses, that kind of thing are obviously *really* hard to get passed.\n\nSomething like a really good-sized tax credit for first time home buyers would help with the housing situation, it would help people afford homes and incentivize developers to build more homes geared towards first time buyers. But, people who already have a house don't give a shit and don't want other people getting help that they didn't. People who think their insurance is better than a single payer system or simply think single payer would make their care worse don't want that even though it would make care improve across the board for less money. Because, again, people aren't rational actors.\n\n> Eh, I disagree that knowing more about economics is a good thing.\n\nWhat? Do you think our entire economy is just held up by magic? Do you think we've stayed the largest economy in the world for the past 60+ years with wishes and hopes? The government enlists a *lot* of economists that do a lot of shit to keep things as balanced as possible, it gets more complicated every day and knowledge of economics is the only reason the whole system hasn't imploded in on itself. Anything they do today won't have an effect on the economy for at least two years just due to the sheer scale of it. They have to try to predict what will be happening in two years and what effect what they do today will have in that economic climate. The 2008 recession was literally caused by the government doing exactly what economists told them to *not* do. This has been the story for every economic downturn we've had after The Great Depression. Hell, they were even warning that we weren't prepared for a pandemic before COVID hit.\n\nEconomists agree with a lot of the common-sense solutions people want to help the economy, healthcare, corporate taxes, better social safety nets and so on. But none of that shit can get very far because of politicians, so economists are trying to hold this shit together while people blame them for it. The prominent politicians fighting for these changes themselves have degrees in economics like AOC and Elizabeth Warren.
