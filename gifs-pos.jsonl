What a fucking joke world we live in that all this, all this time is seen as okay, and not enough for the higher governmental powers to step and be like \"that shit won't work in this day and age\" shitty shit. In a way, I hope Trump loses and all his followers try Jan 6 again. But this time there are lots of military with guns, and if there are a few casualties, that's fine. You reap what you sow you fucks, You dumb ignorant maga fucks. I hope in the end when that orange bastard eventually dies, you all see the error of your ways. You can continue to be the racist terrible part of society that will always exist but you won't have your sharting leader to embolden you. How goddamn dumb. In 2025, you all will share the same ideologies as people from 1825. You all should have taken his advice and injected yourselves with bleach. Goddamn this got me riled up.

What about leaving the border open for just ANYONE to come in without the proper legal processes? My own mother, who is Canadian, is trying to become a citizen the correct way and she will likely have to wait years before her application is approved while a dude can simply just hop the fence and instantly live a life here in this country. What about plummeting our economy into the crapper and making it to where daily supplies for living such as groceries, gas, apartment rent, and homes all go up in price? How about the fact that none of you would even have a vaccine to give at all if it wasn\u2019t for Trump expediting it with Operation Warpspeed? What about the fact that Biden also wiped out baby formula from supermarket shelves and shipped crates of it to the southern border while leaving nothing for American mothers? What about Biden putting perverted and pornographic material into school systems that exposes children to material that shouldn\u2019t even be in their minds at such a young age? What about Biden putting laws into place that allow children to make huge decisions about their own medical care and life-altering surgeries that could potentially damage them down the line when they aren\u2019t even aware of who they are or what they want in life yet? What about Biden dragging the US into a war in the middle east? \n\nAlso, and this Biden fuck up is a beauty\u2026. What about when Biden rapidly pulled troops out of Afghanistan with no real organized process and left billions of dollars worth of military hardware and weaponry in the hands of the Taliban?", "label": 1}
