It could be saying \"first one thing happened, then the other thing happened,\" which the Old Testament does a lot (e.g. when it says so-and-so lived xyz years, then had their first son such-and-such, then lived abc more years) so like, \"first Noah recorded the flood at 15 cubits high, then he couldn't keep measuring it but he eventually noticed the tops of mountains were covered,\" or it could be saying that the ark sank half its height into the water, so that the waters were 15 cubits up the buoyant ark.\n\nAnyway, that does very much sound like it's describing a total kill of all terrestrial life not on the ark, though tbf when it says \"earth,\" it doesn't mean it in the modern sense of \"planet,\" but more like \"land,\" and it's told in a manner suggesting it's an oral tradition recorded by Noah's descendants, so it's basically what Noah told his sons, Noah does not have any divine insight about what's happening further away than he can see. A reading of it as a local flood isn't entirely implausible. It does say God's motive is to kill all humans not on the ark, but as per the Tower of Babel story, the humans weren't all over the world yet but mostly localized, so if that was God's goal he wouldn't necessarily need a bigger flood. This does also make it a bit less crazy that Noah would have *complete* animal biodiversity from *every* continent represented in an ark of the dimensions given--if God didn't flood places where there were no humans yet, it wouldn't be necessary.\n\nThis is just discussing what the text is actually saying, not debating whether it happened in real life or comparing the story to RL archeological evidence.", "label": 1}

{"text": "> So Jesus was insane in that line of thinking.\n\nJesus wasn't insane.\n\nAnd it's lovely that as an atheist, I get to defend Jesus in this sub ;-)\n\nBTW I have zero problems accepting that Jesus was a real person, and that he impressed enough people enough that they built a religion around his memory.\n\nHowever...\n\nJesus was a man of his time. We can assume that he would have believed the things that sane people believed at the time. He wouldn't have had all the knowledge that was developed in later centuries. So he was more than likely wrong in some of his beliefs about nature and the universe. \n\nAlso, we don't positively *know* exactly what he believed or what he told his audience to believe. We only have an idea of what people remembered him saying, or what people remembered others telling them about what he was saying. We also know that the writing of the Gospels was very much a literary exercise. The authors had to forge a narrative from the memories. Where they had to fill in the blanks, they did it with a view to make the story conform to the religion that had emerged.\n\nSeveral attempts were made of this, we know that four of them ended up in the Canon - we know these as the Gospels. Reading them, we still can't know whether Jesus was born in Bethlehem or Nazareth though.\n\nWe know that the allegorical and metaphorical meaning of stories like that of the Flood wasn't lost on people in the Ancient Middle East. Storytelling was a sophisticated art form there. As it often is in any illiterate or preliterate society. Jesus must likely have been a good storyteller himself.\n\nThat there's a deeper meaning in the stories if you look past a simplistic literal interpretation, is the whole point of them. It's what made and makes them interesting.\n\nYou're missing out on such ancient stories if you insist that they must have happened exactly as the text says. And that's whether you believe in God or not.\n\nThe atheist who goes \"the Flood and the Ark can't have happened so the Bible is just worthless\" understands as little as the fundamentalist who thinks it absolutely did happen.\n\nOf course there was no global flood and no Noah's Ark.

{"text": "Exploring the question of why lust is often considered wrong requires a deeper examination of biblical texts, psychological implications, and the broader theological context involving Yahweh and Yeshua. Here\u2019s a more detailed analysis:\n\n### Biblical Context\n\n1. **The Nature of Desire**:\n   - **Creation and Purpose**: In Genesis, Yahweh created humanity and deemed it \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). The intention behind human sexuality is rooted in the divine design for relationships, intimacy, and procreation. However, when desire becomes disordered\u2014focusing solely on physical gratification\u2014it detaches from this purpose.\n\n2. **Lust as Sin**:\n   - **Heart and Intentions**: Yeshua\u2019s teaching in Matthew 5:27-28 highlights that sin is not just about actions but also about the heart\u2019s intentions. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that Yahweh desires authenticity and integrity in one\u2019s thoughts and actions (1 Samuel 16:7).\n\n3. **Consequences of Lust**:\n   - **Proverbs and Moral Wisdom**: Proverbs often personifies wisdom and folly. Lust can lead to folly, as seen in Proverbs 7, where the narrative warns against the seductive allure of the adulteress, leading to ruin. This illustrates how unrestrained desire can lead to destructive paths.\n\n### Psychological Implications\n\n1. **Objectification and Relationships**:\n   - **Impact on Self-Image**: When individuals engage in lustful thoughts, they may inadvertently objectify others, reducing them to mere physical attributes. This can lead to a cycle of seeing oneself and others through a distorted lens, affecting self-esteem and interpersonal dynamics.\n\n2. **Guilt and Shame**:\n   - **Cognitive Dissonance**: Engaging in lustful behavior can create a dissonance between one\u2019s values and actions, leading to feelings of guilt or shame. This psychological conflict can have long-lasting effects, contributing to anxiety and depression.\n\n3. **Attachment Theory**:\n   - **Healthy vs. Unhealthy Attachments**: Lust can disrupt the formation of healthy attachments. Emotional connections are built on respect and mutuality, whereas lust often fosters superficial connections, which can lead to feelings of isolation and emptiness.\n\n### Theological Considerations\n\n1. **Holiness and Purity**:\n   - **Call to Holiness**: Both the Old and New Testaments emphasize living a life of holiness (1 Peter 1:16). This call invites individuals to pursue purity in thoughts and actions, aligning with Yahweh\u2019s character and intentions for humanity.\n\n2. **Grace and Redemption**:\n   - **Role of Yeshua**: In Christian theology, Yeshua offers redemption and grace for those who struggle with sin, including lust. This grace invites believers to seek transformation through the Holy Spirit, emphasizing that while temptation exists, there is a pathway to healing and renewal (Romans 12:2).\n\n3. **Community and Accountability**:\n   - **Role of the Faith Community**: Engaging in discussions about lust and sexuality within a faith community can provide support and accountability. Encouraging open dialogues can help individuals navigate their feelings in a healthy and constructive manner.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding why lust is often deemed wrong involves recognizing its potential to lead to objectification, emotional distress, and the misalignment of one\u2019s actions with divine intentions. The biblical teachings of Yahweh and Yeshua encourage believers to approach their desires with mindfulness, seeking to uphold the values of respect, integrity, and love. In doing so, individuals can cultivate healthier relationships and a deeper sense of self, ultimately aligning their lives with their spiritual beliefs.", "label": 1}

Having any other God is sinful. Hating others is a sin...but God only hates some of them? That is not unbiblical. The Bible teaches us that God loves the world, not certain people based on which sins they are guilty of committing. God is forgiving to ALL of His Children, but not all of the world are His children. God will judge all non-believers for their sins whether they believe it is a sin or not. The Bible makes this clear.   \n  \nLove is telling people the truth about sin and the good news about the salvation of Jesus Christ before they perish. If you were on a plane that was going down and you know where there are parachutes for everyone, would you not try and save the people on that plane with you? Love is making people aware that we are ALL guilty of sin and Jesus paid that debt for us. \n\nGod did not make a mistake when He created us man or woman. It's our feelings that are flawed, not our assigned genitalia at birth. Feelings come and go and should not be trusted when it clearly contradicts reality. Love is letting people know they are beautifully and wonderfully created just the way they are and don't need surgery or transitioning hormones.   \n  \nSexual preference is a choice. God did not make anyone gay. You are not born gay. My daughter used to be gay, my brother used to be straight, my aunt used to be bi, I could go on.....the point is, these are choices we make every day and do not define our identity. People who find their identity in their sexuality have been failed by this world. And our worldly culture normalizes it. \n\nMaybe if us Christians were a little kinder to people who struggle with these and other sins, it would help change the way secular people look at sin issues. We all sin every damn day. Christianity changes the way we look at sin, it doesn't equal sinless perfection.", "label": 1}

This is how the evangelicals with phds in mother goose rationalize. But I get it. If you don't want to believe what the text says, you just take any old excuse to make it mean something different. \n\nPoint B is *\"use of some rare verb that can mean disfigurement or blooming\"*\n\nWrong. it's not a single word that makes my case, it is the entirety of the text. It never ceases to amaze me that christians will scream \"CONTEXT,\" whenever they are faced with a verse they don't like, but are fine with relying on a single word when that is required for their apologetic. \n\nRead the whole thing, and the whole bible for that matter. They have no qualms about killing and raping children in the bible. The idea that it would suddenly be problematic to kill a fetus because it came from a pregnant woman is utterly delusional. Not to mention most of the translations don't even use disfigurment or bloom. It says the *belly will swell and the thigh will rot*. There are even translations that say **\"*****her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.\"***\n\nAnd the fnal bit of hilarity is that Dan even says at the end of all this \"*it's possible (that it's refering to a uterus,) but it's interpretive.\"* Motherfucker, that is all you christians do is apply interpretive explanations to bible verses...unlesss it's something you like, then it becomes literal.

I addressed that [back up in this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1g68o7t/can_christians_believe_in_evolution/ltxr75u/); it's clear you didn't even read that page very well, because if you did you would have found that none of the objections hold up.\n\nI pointed out earlier that your claim about thermodynamics being an issue was explicitly addressed on that page as follows:\n\n>>Since the second law of thermodynamics has a precise mathematical definition, this argument can be analyzed quantitatively. This was done by physicist Daniel F. Styer, who concluded: \"Quantitative estimates of the entropy involved in biological evolution demonstrate that there is no conflict between evolution and the second law of thermodynamics.\"\n\nAnd, mysteriously, you didn't acknowledge this.  You didn't address it at all.  The simple fact that actually _doing the math_ refutes your argument from entropy didn't bother you, because...\n\n>Sorry but I know what side I'm on.\n\nSo do I; you're on the side of the \"liars for Jesus\".  You don't care what is true so long as it fits with your preferred story.  \n\nYou don't care that we have plentiful evidence for common descent, nor that you can't address literally any of it.\n\nYou don't care that your thermodynamics argument is mathematically unsound and based on a misunderstanding about what entropy is in the first place.\n\nYou don't even care that you don't know the difference between a theory and a law, and doubled down on your misunderstanding thereof.\n\nYou will keep your ears happily plugged for you're interested not in science but in faith; where science changes based on what's observed, faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved.", "label": 1}

You on the other hand teach that I am bad, evil, stupid, or whatever negative adjective, simply because I'm skeptical of evolution.\n\nNo my guy, the problem is that you're not actually skeptical.  Skepticism is indeed a good thing, but skepticism requires that you are able to weigh the options and consider the evidence.  You've shown quite clearly that you are not, and thus you are not skeptical.  You are what is termed [pseudoskeptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoskepticism); you are dogmatically opposed to the theory of evolution and there is, as you already said, nothing that can change your mind.\n\nCase in point:\n\n>Hence your goal, though you cover it up well, isn't education or healthy debate, but simply trying to \"fix\" people who don't believe like you.\n\nAnd yet you're the one who can't address _literally any of the evidence at hand_.

Even when being more careful about your assumptions, every one is another opportunity to be wrong, which means that if two notions are otherwise equal, the one that makes fewer assumptions is more likely correct.\n\nThis is why, for example, \"my house is cold because I forgot to turn the heater on\" is more likely than \"my house is cold because a faerie turned down my heater while I was away\".\n\nThe faerie example, as with your mythological claims, violates what is known as ontological parsimony; you are assuming additional things exist without reason or need, and in doing so making your claim inherently less likely to be true.\n\n>How is it possible?

It's untestable, unprovable, and unobservable. The only difference between it and YEC is YEC has religious credibility backing it up. You have no reason to believe in the Big Bang other than it's the best explanation that doesn't involve God\n\nEverything you just said is a lie, and frankly you should be ashamed of yourself.  In order:\n\n* The big bang is a theory, not a hypothesis.\n* The big bang is a predictive model, and its predictions not only are testable but have been tested and borne out.\n* By definition, no scientific theory is provable absolutely, but the big bang has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n* It is observation that led to the formation of the big bang and it is observation that validated its predictions.\n* There is no such thing as \"religious credibility\", for religions rely not on credibility but credulity.\n* [The evidence at hand](https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/astro/cosmos/bigbang/bb_evid) is more than sufficient reason to accept the big bang model, and you obviously can't actually address the evidence, which is why you simply dodged it.\n* God is not an explanation; as you have demonstrated, God is an excuse.\n\n> You think of yourself as a logical, evidence based, atheist, but your just angry antitheist who will do whatever you can to make the idea of God seem silly.\n\nOn the one hand, you don't need my help to make your idea of God seem silly; you've got that in the bag.\n\nOn the other hand, it's unsurprising that you'd lie about me and my motivation given all the lies you already told about the big bang and science itself to try and make your case.  Bearing false witness appears to be your MO.\n\n>There are a ton of things you can't prove but you still believe. Can you prove that love is real? Can you prove you exist? Can you prove there is no God? Can you prove that YEC is false?\n\nYes, of course I can prove love is real.  Love without evidence is just stalking.\n\nYes, of course I can prove I exist.  _Cogito, ergo sum._\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"God\"; you failed to define it.  As you don't even have a definition, I have no need to comment on this non-thing of yours whatsoever.\n\nAnd as YEC has no more basis than \"magical pixies on mars are holding a tea party that will decide the next US election\", I have no need to disprove it at all.\n\nDisbelief is the default position; I do not need any reason to disbelieve something outside of having no reason to _believe_ something.  This is trivial to prove; if you had to believe everything that you couldn't disprove, you'd end up believing multiple contradictory things, which is absurd.  Because it leads to logical absurdity, belief cannot be the default position.  As such, disbelief must be the default position.  This is really quite simple epistemology; you should consider taking some time to study the topic.\n\n>You claimed it was impossible. To quote you, \"silly, baseless, and nonsense\" and \"worthless\", I'd like some proof of that claim.\n\nYou provided no basis, therefore it is baseless.  Because there is no means of reaching it as a conclusion through reason nor evidence, it cannot be held sensibly, therefore it is nonsense.  With no explanatory nor predictive power, nothing can be done with the concept, therefore it is worthless.\n\nWhen your notion is baseless, nonsensical, and worthless, and when atop that you've failed to even define the major concept it relies on, and when atop that you had to lie repeatedly to try misrepresent a scientific theory as being on the same level as your claim...what more do you need for the term \"silly\" to apply?\n\n>It is possible. God could do it, couldn't He? Why is this so hard to understand!\n\nYou don't seem to know what your God is, can't explain how it does anything at all, and can't give any justification for what it can or can't do.  The issue here is you haven't presented anything _to_ understand; what you've said is equivalent to \"it's magic\".  As of yet, I have no reason to think your favorite mythological character can do anything at all.  You've actually given me _less_ reason to think God \"could do it\" than a mall psychic has given me to think they can read the future in a pack of cards.\n\n>A thing is possible until proven impossible. Something that you have failed to do \n\nWhen you can't even define \"a thing\" in the first place, there's nothing to prove impossible; it seems you don't even know what you're talking about.\n\n>Well that's a completely different discussion.

Embrace Islam; furthermore speaking from a Muslim experience, God is merciful and loving but also balances that with justice, meaning if you commit immoral acts your whole life and expect God to forgive you out of mercy, your mentally ill. Also in Islamic theology we justify eternal hell due to the belief of \"repeating act\"; this states that God will only takes one soul at a time when there is determination of him being in that state even if he were to live infinitely, so if a sinful person was to be given unlimited time he would repeat his sinful behavior, due to this there is infinite hell. In a hypothetical scenario (as it is impossible especially in modern society) if a person wouldnt hear about Islam on the day of judgement he would be tested based upon his knowledge, Islam is flexible in these places. And God doesnt kill his creation for no reason, it is a test upon man (humankind) to experience natural diesters and disease, if there's no problem or conflicting idea, what would the test be about? And Yes God is real, the God that Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (Peace upon all of them) worshipped is real, Even contemporary atheist scholars agree that the Abrahamic God is the one of the most probable cause to the existence of the universe. And I can debate you any time of the week and prove the existence of God. God ISNT CRUEL he is the giver of justice, in fact in Islam it is believed that God loves you 70 times more then your mother (through studies it's proven a mother has the strongest bond with her children), God is closer then you then your jugular vein. \n\nI preach Islamic monotheism to you, accept Islam.", "label": 1}

{"text": "(Sorry in advance for the long reply!)\n\nWhat tells you it\u2019s part of his plan? Sure, God is all-powerful, but he\u2019s limited his power to give each of us free will. We live in a fallen, broken world made up of human beings exorcising that free will. As a result, we experience suffering and heartache daily. Any Christian who tells you they have perfect mental health and don\u2019t go through trials and tribulations is lying to you.\n\nNowhere does the Bible promise us anything Earthly for becoming a Christian. In fact, there are constant examples in the Bible of believers facing great persecution. The promise of Christ is this: **We are all sinners who fall short of God\u2019s standard. But through Christ, God has offered reconciliation for our wrongdoing and given us the opportunity for eternal life with him by faith.** \n\nBut still, I think many Christians feel similar to you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting to me that in verses such as Psalm 118:24 and Galatians 5:22, it\u2019s made clear that we\u2019re to rejoice and be glad. In Philippians 4:4, Paul writes:\n\n>\u201cAlways be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again\u2014rejoice!\u201d\n\nBut how can we choose to be glad, or joyful? Especially when things are going so poorly for us? Well, consider that as Paul wrote this letter to the Philippians, they were undergoing tremendous persecution for their beliefs. Paul isn\u2019t telling them to be glad that they are being persecuted. He\u2019s telling them to find real peace and happiness - through faith and relationship with God.\n\nOur happiness and contentment is not based on external factors. There are poor people who are happier than I\u2019ll ever be, and rich people battling depression and suicidal thoughts. Yes, happiness can be found temporarily by getting a promotion or doing something pleasurable, but real happiness is found internally. That\u2019s why so many born-again Christians insist that their lives are changed by putting their faith in Christ; they typically don\u2019t become more successful by worldly standards, but their internal transformation and pursuit of righteousness provide tremendous meaning.\n\n**Scripture**\n\n>\u201cThen you will experience God\u2019s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand.

Adam and Eve began to reason ( such a horrible thing to do). They daydreamed situations where God was not being fair and they began to believe Satan\u2019s lies about there being something missing    If the fruit was symbolic, I believe that Satan worked hard on Eve to convince her that she truly was missing out and God simply didn\u2019t want them to have all the knowledge Satan said would come to them. ( yet that would be the knowledge of good and evil ; not God plan) Eve fell for his smooth talking and felt ripped off by God for not getting all the wisdom apparently available. She bit into the fruit. ( I personally see the fruit as the bait of Satan, the thing seeming so harmless, but enough to transform humanity, it was so simple: just don\u2019t do it. God\u2019 s easy to obey object lesson which only took a bit of trust in their creator) \nOverjoyed, Satan suggested Adam try it to didn\u2019t he? Well, no Eve gave it to him )They figured nothing had happened. Adam following his wife\u2019s choice not his own, and followed suit. Instantly they behaved like kids who just ate all the peanut butter and were covered in it. They simply had to hide. And they noticed they were naked. This was the information Satan said Jesus was keeping from them: the info of how horrible it is to disobey God and the knowing that you\u2019ve done terribly wrong. There\u2019s Nothing pleasing about that knowledge. Weren\u2019t they even told that they would live forever?! Satan is the author of lies. Sadly , they now were both\nNaked, embarrassed, hiding, blaming each other and full of guilt and shame ( well also denial). Jesus was out for his daily stroll I. The garden, looking for his friends, but couldn\u2019t see them it was common for God to chat with Adam and Eve in the garden. But now clearly something was amiss. God called out to them asking where they were. Finally they popped out of the bushes wearing whatever they had found to use a clothes. God wasn\u2019t impressed and said,\u201d what are you wearing? Who told you you were naked?\u201dEve chimed up right away saying how it was the snake\u2019s fault. God knew what had happened but he got confessions out of them and then punishment was due. God banned them from the Garden of Eden and set an angel at its gate to guard and secure it. God said that life would be temporary and result in death at its end.

Weird, isn't it?\n\nAlso it's cute that you think anything below the creator has any say about what the creator can do. You may say \"what about the things above the creator\" to which I'll say \"there's nothing there, so nothing but the creator has authority\"\n\n>Are you starting to understand yet why the burdon of proof rests with the person making the claim? I don't have to disprove god, I can just say I don't believe you.\n\nYou can do that, but your claim is that there is no God. So prove your point. Believers don't say there is God, they have faith there is. The owners is never on the believer to prove God, it's on the non believers.\n\n\"I have faith there is God\" \"prove it\" \"no need, I just have faith, and that's all that is needed\"\n\nVs\n\n\"You know God isn't real, right?\" \"Then prove it\" nuh uh, as a believer you have to prove he's real\" \"no I don't, cause I have faith\"\n\nThat's what the argument is\n\nYet because people are kind enough to try and save you from your own folley, and you refuse to accept their evidence, you think that they are wrong.\n\nUltimately, if you're thinking logically, what happens if someone is Altruistic and has faith in a God that doesn't exist? Oh, they lived a truly Altruistic life and made the world a better place? How awful\n\nVs\n\nWhat happenes when someone claims there's no God, and there happens to be a God? Doesn't ever end well.\n\nSo, best of luck to you. Your lack of faith is your problem, not mine. I gonna keep having faith, and none of your trite attempts to change that will ever work. \n\nI'll let you be happy thinking there's no God, despite the fact I feel that's a terrible decision to make, so you do you, I'll do me.\n\nBut the fact that atheists can not just let people be happy in their beliefs that there is God is proof that atheists have no morals and wish to make everyone as miserable as themselves. Learn to have respect for others, amd leave them to enjoy their beliefs. \n\nI let you belive there's no God, you should let me believe there is one.

I think good deeds to others is better motivated by wanting to help others, rather than securing one's spot in heaven. An obsession of purity can honestly delude people into thinking they are better than others. I have no appreciation for how much it belittles humanity and focuses predominantly on sin rather than the goodness we can bring each other. Criticism also tends to be unwelcomed, and not just the unreasonable critiques. \n\nI'd appreciate Christianity more if it tried to bring heaven to earth regardless of who everyone is.

{"text": "It sounds like you\u2019re giving this a lot of thought, which is good. Marriage is a beautiful commitment, and it\u2019s natural to want to approach it with both love and wisdom. As you\u2019re exploring whether now is the right time to marry, especially given the age gap, here are a few perspectives that might help you reflect on this with both heart and mind.\n\n1. Consider Personal and Emotional Maturity\n\nAt 19, you\u2019re in a stage where many things about your life, perspectives, and goals may still be evolving. Even though you and your boyfriend share values and a vision for the future, it\u2019s worth asking if you\u2019ve both had time to build a foundation for understanding one another\u2019s needs as you grow. There\u2019s no question that age gaps can work well for some couples, but they often bring different expectations, habits, and approaches to life\u2019s challenges. These differences don\u2019t make a relationship unhealthy, but they do mean that honest, frequent communication is vital to navigating the natural differences that may come up as you go forward.\n\n2. The Gift of Time for Discernment\n\nSince you\u2019re already in a committed, serious relationship, think about using this time together to deepen your relationship and continue discernment. For Catholics, marriage isn\u2019t just about romance and attraction; it\u2019s a vocation, a shared path to holiness, and a lifelong partnership. Spend time asking each other those big questions about family life, faith, finances, and personal dreams. In particular, make sure you\u2019re on the same page about what being married will look like day-to-day. The Church\u2019s view on marriage emphasizes a partnership built on mutual respect, shared responsibilities, and spiritual growth together, so consider whether you\u2019re in sync on these points.\n\n3. Reflect on Family Concerns with an Open Heart\n\nYour family\u2019s concerns likely come from a place of love and protection. Since they\u2019ve seen you grow up, they may have insights into how you\u2019re likely to navigate the challenges of marriage or adulthood that you may not fully see in yourself yet. I\u2019d encourage you to listen to your dad\u2019s and family\u2019s thoughts as lovingly as possible\u2014they may have some wisdom to share, even if it\u2019s not easy to hear. It\u2019s also a chance to involve your boyfriend in these conversations, making sure he understands that marriage is a commitment that will involve both of your families, especially when you have children.\n\n4. Pray and Seek Counsel\n\nSince you\u2019re both Catholic, this can be a great time to turn to prayer and even spiritual counsel together. If you haven\u2019t already, consider talking with a priest or spiritual mentor who can offer guidance about your specific situation. Catholic marriage preparation programs (often called Pre-Cana) can help couples discern and prepare for the commitment of marriage, and they can be a valuable resource for you, whether you decide to marry now or wait a little longer.\n\n5. Practical Preparation\n\nFinally, remember that marriage is not just a one-time commitment but a lifelong journey that requires practical preparation. As you\u2019re in college, think about whether your education, personal goals, and financial stability have reached a point that supports the kind of life you want to build together. Since you want to be a stay-at-home mom someday, make sure that you\u2019ve both thought through what this might look like in terms of finances, career paths, and family life. Planning well for these areas can help build confidence that your love has a solid, sustainable foundation.\n\nIn the end, there\u2019s no one right age to get married\u2014it depends deeply on the individuals involved, their level of maturity, and their readiness for the demands and sacrifices of marriage. Remember that love, true love, is patient. If your relationship is solid now, it will only deepen and mature with time, allowing you both to enter marriage with confidence.\n\nI hope these perspectives help you as you discern. Marriage is a beautiful journey, and I wish you both the very best on the path God is calling you to walk together.", "label": 1}

{"text": "So why did Yahweh God have to die himself to forgive your sins? I will explain, he came to die, because Yahweh married Israel, and then Israel committed adultery by fornicating and worshipping pagan deities.  \n  \nUnder the law, adultery must be punished by death. A woman who cheats on her husband, or a man who has sex with another man's wife, must be killed.  \n  \nBut God loved Israel so much that He didn't want that to happen. So instead, He came to die. Because if a woman's husband dies, then she is freed of her marital obligations under the law, and can re-marry if she wishes. Thus, either Israel had to die, or God had to die. God chose to be born as a mortal man, from the line of David, in fulfillment of the prophecies of a messiah. He then died, freeing Israel from her marriage to Him, and in turn freeing Israel from her sin of adultery. Through God's death, Israel was saved from her sins, and in Christ's resurrection, we can see that he truly was God in the flesh, and no mere pretender or false messiah.  \n  \nSo Yahweh God had to die to free Israel of sin as otherwise, he would break his own law, which makes him a liar, or Israel would die out, which would also make him a liar.", "label": 1}

{"text": ">It acknowledged that science, which is grounded in falsifiability and empirical observation, as you have correctly pointed out, deals only with the regular, repeatable phenomena of the natural world. Miracles, by contrast, are extraordinary interventions by a creator and thus lie outside this scientific framework. To state it again, my original post\u2019s key claim was that accepting science\u2019s descriptive laws does not preclude the possibility of miracles because these laws describe the regular operations of nature, while miracles are exceptions introduced by a transcendent agent, and that the existence of miracles does not diminish the utility of scientific inquiry, as some have claimed.\n\nIf miracles are real, you really lose all basis for science, as we have no way to know when divine intervention is at work and when it's not.\n\nFor example, when you have miracles in the mix, it's impossible to demonstrate that gravity, an impersonal force, is responsible for objects falling 'down' towards the center of the planet when dropped.\n\nHow do you eliminate the possibility that the deity is just pulling objects to the ground, in contravention of their natural tendency to fly out into space, every time we let go of them? You can't because of the falsiability problem.\n\nWhen humans ntroduce the Christian deity and miracles into our worldviews, they lose all ability to rely on science because the worldview assumes that the universe doesn't operate solely on impersonal, predictable, and understandable processes, and offers no method by which we can determine what happens due to those processes and what happens due to divine intervention.", "label": 1}

Abortion is the murdering of innocent children, which is Satanic sacrifice! We know very well that our Lord Jesus Christ loves children and despises those who sacrificed their children to the devil. Also, we are called to be light and salt to the world. We can not tolerate wickedness such as gender mutilation! Is Trump a perfect guy?

Guys, please, do not be deceived by these wolves in sheep clothing! Kamala is unable to do an interview without teleprompter or script, the very few times she speaks genuinely, she openly goes AGAINST Christ. Do not believe her deceptions! Do your own research, pray and ask the Holy Spirit for revelation, and please listen to true Spirit-filled pastors and prophets, of whom many are on YouTube and have been personally invited to PRAY over Trump.

Basically every reformation leader called for the oppression of someone else as a part of their reformation.\n\nThis is your Christopher Columbus problem. \n\nThis list doesn't even include Henry VIII who only left Catholicism because he wanted to murder his wives for not producing make heirs (a problem of his own shit inbreed royal genetics)\n\nEarly Reformers (Pre-Reformation)\n\n1. John Wycliffe \u2013 His writings, while critical of church corruption, were later used to justify violence against the Catholic Church and clergy during the Peasants' Revolt in England, although he personally did not endorse violence.\n\n2. Jan Hus \u2013 Hus\u2019s teachings spurred Hussite Wars (15th century), which led to prolonged violence and sectarian strife in Bohemia, resulting in significant loss of life.\n\n3. Girolamo Savonarola \u2013 A fiery preacher who incited the \"Bonfire of the Vanities,\" in which Florentines destroyed art, books, and other luxuries, blaming these for moral corruption. His fanatical purges and influence over Florence sowed fear and strict moral policing.\n\nMain Protestant Reformation Leaders\n\n4. Martin Luther \u2013 In later life, he wrote extremely antisemitic works, such as On the Jews and Their Lies, which fueled centuries of antisemitic attitudes in Germany. He also supported brutal repression of the German Peasants' War, urging nobles to \"smite, slay, and stab\" peasants who sought social reform.\n\n5. Philipp Melanchthon \u2013 Known for his harsh condemnation of Anabaptists and support of religious persecution; he also supported state-controlled religious reform, which included punishments for those deviating from Protestant orthodoxy.\n\n6. Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 Led the violent persecution of Anabaptists in Zurich, which included executing some by drowning as a \u201cthird baptism.\u201d He was also an advocate of militaristic action, dying in battle during the Swiss Wars of Kappel.\n\n7. John Calvin \u2013 Known for his strict theocratic rule in Geneva, where he authorized the execution of Michael Servetus, a dissident theologian, for heresy. Calvin enforced harsh punishments for various sins, creating an atmosphere of moral policing.\n\n8. William Tyndale \u2013 While his Bible translation advanced literacy, he held strong views against Catholicism, which added to sectarian conflicts in England. His works were used by later Protestants to justify anti-Catholic violence.\n\n9. John Knox \u2013 Wrote vehemently against Catholicism, especially targeting Mary, Queen of Scots, whom he described with virulent misogyny. His teachings fueled intense anti-Catholic sentiments in Scotland and justified violent persecution of Catholics.\n\n10. Martin Bucer \u2013 While he worked for unity among Protestants, he also advocated religious persecution against Catholics and Anabaptists and supported violent repression of religious dissent.\n\nRadical Reformers (Anabaptists and other movements)\n\n11. Thomas M\u00fcntzer \u2013 Advocated violent revolt, contributing to the German Peasants\u2019 War, where thousands of peasants were slaughtered. He believed in an \"apocalyptic holy war\" to cleanse society of nonbelievers.\n\n12. Menno Simons \u2013 While he promoted pacifism, his rigid separatism led to Anabaptists being viewed as heretics and extremists, which in turn justified severe persecution and violence against his followers.\n\nEnglish Reformation\n\n13. Thomas Cranmer \u2013 Although he supported Protestant reforms, he was involved in burning dissenters at the stake during the reign of Edward VI and supported brutal enforcement of religious conformity.\n\n14. Hugh Latimer \u2013 Known for approving of heresy executions during Edward VI\u2019s reign, including advocating that \"heretics\" be burned. Ironically, he was later martyred for his Protestant beliefs under Queen Mary.\n\n15. John Hooper \u2013 Supported the persecution and imprisonment of Catholics during the English Reformation, promoting intolerance towards those who refused to conform to Protestant doctrines.\n\nLater Reformation Leaders and Spread of Protestantism\n\n16. Theodore Beza \u2013 Successor to Calvin, he upheld and justified the execution of heretics and reinforced Geneva\u2019s strict theocratic control, defending harsh punishments for religious dissent.\n\n17. Jacob Arminius \u2013 Though his ideas were less militant, the Arminian-Calvinist debate sparked intense hostility and factional violence in the Netherlands, deepening divisions within Protestantism.\n\n18. John Smyth \u2013 His rigid religious separatism led to significant splits within the early Baptist community, and his antagonistic writings helped stoke divisions with the established Church of England.\n\n19. George Fox \u2013 Founder of the Quakers, Fox was seen as a radical, inciting strict moral discipline among followers, and his ideas led to confrontations with both civil and religious authorities, though generally nonviolent.\n\n20. William Penn \u2013 While known for promoting religious tolerance, Penn's governance in Pennsylvania wasn't fully equitable, and he enforced strict adherence to Quaker norms, ostracizing those who did not conform.", "label": 1}

{"text": "While it's true that written history spans only a few thousand years, archaeological and genetic evidence indicates that humans have existed for approximately 200,000 to 300,000 years. The development of writing and recorded history was a gradual process influenced by many factors, including the rise of civilizations, cultural developments, and technological advancements. Additionally, scientific methods like radiometric dating and genetic analysis provide robust evidence for the Earth's age, supported by a multitude of independent studies across various disciplines. These methods are not based solely on conjecture but on extensive empirical data and rigorous testing. Ignoring this evidence limits our understanding of human history and the natural world.", "label": 1}

I mean examine yourself;\n\nYou accuse others of being bad people, but here you are, doing mean and evil things to others. This liberalism and other beliefs you probably hold, like Humanism probably, they originate from the devil, but the humans who spread it, being tricked by the devil, were people like the leaders of Soviet Russia. Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB agent whos organization (KGB) worked to bring liberalism, socialism, and communism, and even stuff like humanism into America and other countries, even flat out speaks on how these ideologies you are dealing with, work to remove the capacity for critical thinking.\n\nSee, through echo chambers, blind trust in media and educators and government, and emotionalism, and your brain getting targeted over and over again by intentionally distorted and inflated things (like the media intentionally saying George Floyd died because of the police when the medical results showed he died from drug overdose after hitting his ex wife who had a baby in the womb and he hit the womb) will constantly be used to target those who brainwashing will work on.\n\nSo its not even that someone like you is dumb or something. But due to stuff like over emotionalism, and such, and evil media and educators, people like you get bombarded 24/7 with lies and deception. You're told how to think and why, and then are also excluded by others when you get away from the status que too.\n\nBut, in love I say this; You're brainwashed. There is no racism, phobia, or other thing your resorting to imagining. I understand you were taught to think that. But you were lied to. The person you replied to is not a bigot. And it is very evil, mean, ungodly, and unkind, and uncaring for you to say that to a stranger you know nothing about.\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to that person. You are in the wrong because you made up lies about them to yourself and choose to attack and do mean and hurtful things to someone you know nothing about. If Jesus was walking the Earth and saw you do that, He'd call you out for it. But you have an opportunity and Jesus forgives if we repent, and Jesus also says to apologize to those we wronged too, that healing and more will come when we do. You have the opportunity to get unbrainwashed, especially with the help of God, with Jesus's help. If its hard to change (it usually is) God in the bible and through His Spirit (The Holy Spirit) says He is willing to help us change. And God says too, He is willing to show us the truth. So if you are wrong for example, God can and will show you, IF, you let Him, and ask Him to.\n\nYou have an opportunity to let God remove the lies and deception you were fed through these Ideologies and behaviors you were fed and forced to receive and raised up in.

There is nothing to suggest the girls at this party were minors.  This was BEFORE Trump or anyone else knew what kind of person Epstein was.  \n\nEveryone liked Trump and Trump was friendly with everyone , as any good club owner should be.  Then Trump saw Epstein trying to hit on a member's underage daughter, and Trump got angry and kicked Epstein out of his club.  When the police started catching on that Epstein was running some type of underage prostitution ring, Trump was the only one that cooperated with police.  He was the only one that did what he could to help put this pedophile behind bars. The Clintons and many other establishment democrats and republicans began hanging out with Epstein AFTER his illicit pedophile connections were known.  The Epstein client list is still being blocked by the democrats in DC.  Release that list, then we can talk.\n\nTrump The Jane Doe case is a lie, just like every single other case the democrats waited 30 years before they suddenly decided they were assualted.  No credible claims have been made.  Most of them can be dismissed right away because core facts of the case do not match the women's stories.\n\nWe are taught by scripture to not judge by appearances, we are to only judge when we have all the facts.  Just because someone makes an accusation, doesn't make it true.  And these accusations are laughable, everyone can see through these lies, that is why these criminal cases are completely dismissed by most of the country.

But upon growing up in the United States I understand now that Gay people aren't born Gay. It is because they grew up with the influence in their society.

No wonder the people of America have a growing number of Gay people now just like the country where i came from where Gay was so acceptable. Yes God loves everyone. Yes they say come as you are.

{"text": "\"**Chastity and homosexuality**\n\n**2357** Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, **141** tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\" **142** They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.\n\n**2358** The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God\u2019s will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord\u2019s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n\n**2359** Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\"\n\nThe Church makes it clear that homosexuality is a sin, but only if acted upon. To feel attraction is not inherently sinful, but to act on that attraction is. This isn't up for interpretation. This is the direct Catechism of the Catholic Church. I know the Orthodox and Oriental churches feel the same. To claim that this is some interpretation and that somehow the churches which have been following Christ's teachings have somehow been following or teaching it wrongly for over 2000 years is the largest reach to make. Have you ever wondered that maybe it's your interpretation that is incorrect or has led you to a false conclusion, or do you only push that yours is correct because it supports a hedonistic lifestyle? \n\nRomans 1:26-27  \n^(26)\u00a0Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, ^(27)\u00a0and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity.\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11  \n^(9)\u00a0Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites ^(10)\u00a0nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. ^(11)\u00a0That is what some of you used to be; but now you have had yourselves washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.\n\n1 Timothy 1:8-11  \n^(8)\u00a0We know that the law is good, provided that one uses it as law, ^(9)\u00a0with the understanding that law is meant not for a righteous person but for the lawless and unruly, the godless and sinful, the unholy and profane, those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, ^(10)\u00a0the unchaste, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is opposed to sound teaching, ^(11)\u00a0according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.\n\nSodomite is used to state homosexual acts if that somehow isn't clear.

They're interested in playing sports, legos or dolls.\u00a0\nThey aren't old enough to understand or handle adult content like sex or homosexuality. Teaching children at a young ages like 4-8 years old, that only confuses them mentally, and sexually, and is more likely to push them to seek sex as a minor. Making them targets of sexual abuse.\u00a0\nAt that point, \"sex ed\" is damaging to them. Period.\nConvincing kids to want and seek sex is the grooming part.\n\n\nAt around 14/15 kids are capable of understanding sex, and are way more mentally developed to understand boundaries regarding sex.\u00a0\nSex ed at this age makes perfect sense. If they seek sex, they will seek viable partners within their age group.\u00a0\n\n\nGod abhors abortion. All people on earth came from mothers who loved and protected their children.\u00a0\nIf he didn't want someone born, you would have never been conceived period. I'm sorry that doesn't stroke your ego.\u00a0\nGod isn't here to be your slave or servant. Neither is any one man or woman.\u00a0\nIf you want to be aborted so bad, go to your local gun store and do yourself in when you get home. You can ask God all about it before he utterly obliterates you. And make no mistake, he absolutely will let you have it worse than what anyone on earth could ever say to you.\n\n\nEvery woman I know who have ever had an abortion, it was 100% the \"i partied without protection and just don't wanna accept responsibility\" scenario. Not one was because if stillborn/miscarriage, or for any medical reason.\u00a0\n\n\nMost abortions are done under this scenario. CDC will lie about anything to cover their butt's allong with any 3 letter government agency. FDA allows heavy metals, feces, and chemicals like murcury in your water. American baby formula is banned everywhere but here because there are toxins and heavy metals allowed in them, and they allow it because someone greases their palms with lots of money to say \"oh its fine. Its perfectly healthy\" meanwhile america is among the unhealtiest country on earth by average. You should never be taking the things they say that seriously, they aren't God. And neither are you. Neither are the moral authority here. Only God is.\n\n\nGovernments are not about providing for anyone. They are about principals and control. They are not bastions of morality.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may sit there and falsely accuse me of being a biggot or liar, but you are an actual pedophilia advocate and child killer. The\u00a0God of the bible has already condemned you and any who agree with you.\n\n\nThe only reason you breath is by his command and grace. He's giving you the chance to understand and repent. So you should be listening to what God says, and what we followers who know him say. Its very obvious you know nothing and only care about selfish desires.

{"text": "That's a good buisness practice, but also, if a buisness wishes to not have trans people in its buisness, that's their own choice. People should be free to hire the people they want and not hire the ones they don't want. For example, if the job is lifting crates by hand, you wouldn't want to hire someone who's missing an arm and a leg. There are legitimate exceptions for such things. Personally, I would not hire a trans teacher, as there's a track record of trans teachers trying to convince children they are teans and also grooming them at far higher rates than non trans teachers. It would be absurd not to notice those patterns and to avoid the trend in order to keep children safe from grooming, especially children who are far too young for sex Ed lessons.\n\nPersonally, I dislike the trans idealogy, since as a child, my gender as a man was attacked by society over the fact I wanted to be a man with long hair. People kept saying, \"Well, clearly you think should be a woman.\" Or \"Clearly, you want want to be a woman.\"\nIn reality, I just really liked the story of Samson and the aboriginal culture of \"long hair = wisdom\"\n\nSociety continued to try and shove trans idealogy down my throat, which made me incredibly angry that people kept trying to tell me how I should feel about my body. If people choose to become trans of their own accord, then whatever, that's their choice. But to try and convince someone they should be trans because they aren't certain in their identity is predatory, especially in the case of children. Since no child is confident in their own identity, as literally no child knows what they want to be as an adult, let alone do they understand what gender they should be for their whole lives. \n\nWe can't get tattoos until we're 18 because it's permanent modification to the body, but children are encouraged to get sex changes before puberty. And let me tell you, tattoos can he undone far easier than sex changes.\n\nI personally believe that trans is a mental health and here's why. How many times in someone's life does their mind change, many times a day. How many times do their body change on its own. Never.\n\nWhen there's a discrepancy between body and mind, it's the mind that needs to change, as the ones that can change for free.\n\nIf I chose to identity as a trans-amputee and my left arm wasn't mine and needed to be removed from my body, they world would think I'm insane, but now I do so for my dick and in brave? That's why I don't like trans idealogy. \n\nThat being said, I love trans people, I would never treat them poorly, and I would hate on the individual who who is suffering, regardless is that suffering is caused by being in the wrong body, or from think their body is wrong. We call that body dismorphia. If I think my arm is wrong, or I think my body is too fat or too skinny. That's body dismorphia. But if i think my genitals are wrong, then it's not body dismorphia?\n\nI would never treat a trans person  differently than anyone else, but I love them enough to tell them what I think is actually happening to them.\n\nSimilarly, I love fat people, but I'm gonna tell them that obesity is killing then and that they need to get help. If I just say \"no, being fat is healthy, you should stay that way\" then I'm just encouraging them to develop cardiac disease and suffer heart attacks at 20.

It clearly condemns that act with the same clarity it condemns lying, and stealing. Now you can add qualifiers about how you think that Jesus didn't say anything about it being a sin if you steal to feed yourself, or that he didn't say you couldn't lie to save yourself under some specific condition, but the reality is that stealing is condemned. Lying is condemned. The bible clearly and decisively condemns homosexuality.\n\nIt condemns it in all the following versus.\n\nLeviticus 18:22\n\nLeviticus 20:13\n\nRomans 1:26-27 \n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (Some people tried debating that the terms malakoi and arsenokoitai weren't specific, but it really didn't go anywhere. Nobody significant accepted the interpretation. Basically the only people that accepted the alternative meanings were dismissed entirely because every other use outside of the bible regarding these two words are describing homosexual behaviors. So taken into that context there isn't a credible argument that this doesn't reference homosexuality. With that being said, out if you still wanted to exclude this particular verse then you would still have to contend with all the other verses that are explicit in this.)\n\n1 Timothy 1:9-10\n\nSo you have multiple verses that condemn this. You have zero verses that contradict these. There is no verse that says homosexuality is a sin UNLESS...(insert reasons). I'm sorry but this is really just a simple fact.

{"text": "Citing a website based on ideas that popped up in the 1970's and were widely discredited within a decade isn't really a solid argument. For the record it would have been discredited much more quickly, but it took a while for the silly idea to gain enough traction that biblical translators and theologians actually took it seriously enough to look at it. It was essentially glanced at, laughed at, and then tossed in the trash. Of course every few years someone else repackages it, but its the same argument and it immediately gets discredited. Don't get me wrong. \n\nI do appreciate their hustle. I mean it's a great scam if you can pull it off. A bunch of LGBTQ activists and people who just want to believe it is true so much are happy to pay good money for books that tell them that what the bible actually says isn't true. There's good money in telling people sins aren't actually sin. \n\nSo yes....those verses actually do condemn homosexuality. They condemn the act itself specifically. While I appreciate that you quoted a verse to at least try and support your position, quoting 1 John 4:7 shows a significant misunderstanding of what the bible actually teaches. It takes the nature of the verse out of context.\n\nThe bible condemns sexual expression of love in multiple contexts. (This is using love and lust in a clearly simplified way because explaining the nature of love and lust in the full context of Christianity would be...extensive. So we'll just use love a modern definition. ***A deep, tender, and ineffable emotion characterized by affection and solicitude.***)\n\nSome of those contexts where it calls a person's sexual expression of love are...\n\n\\- Incest (It doesn't matter how much two siblings love one another. If they have sex then it is a sin.)\n\n\\- Adultery (It doesn't matter how much they love one another. It is always a sin for them to have sex.)\n\n\\- Premarital Sex (It doesn't matter how much they love one another. If they aren't married it is a sin.)\n\n\\- Bestiality (This one is always creepy, but the fact is that the man or woman participating in this may be madly in love with whatever animal they lust after. That simply doesn't change the fact that they are committing a sin.) \n\nSo if you're saying two men can love one another like family then yes...of course they can. If you're saying they can love one another in a homosexual relationship...of course they can. I'm not disputing that they love one another. What would be the point of arguing about what they believe? The reality is that it doesn't matter if they love one another...God says that the sexual expression of that is a sin. Therefore homosexuality (in the way that we typically define it) is a sin. It will always be a sin no matter how much they love one another.", "label": 1}

Then lets go with that. \n\n1) You Are Unable To Choose\n\n\\- Then why should I care what some THING (because at that point you are neither conscious nor living) feels. Why should I empathize with you in any way. What makes you any more valuable than the turd a bird squirted out on my hood a couple of weeks ago? Why should I even begin to care what your fate is, and why should anyone even bother listening to your complaints because at that point you're just an automaton...you're the robot playing music and singing at the pizza place. Your feelings (to be honest you don't have any actual feelings) simply don't matter because they aren't genuine. They're just programming. \n\nAt the very kindest I would have to assume you were a broken or malfunctioning piece of equipment, because what would be the point of giving you some bizarre programming where you question why are you this way when you lack the capacity to change...and you lack the capacity to truly desire that change. So by your standard  your opinion simply doesn't matter because ultimately you don't really have an opinion. You have obsolete and defective programming by your own standard. Then why would anyone care about a defective toaster?", "label": 1}

You can very easily look up any of this to verify it. \n\nThose who legally immigrated here from China and other communist countries have also pointed out the clear alignment between communist government officials and Kamala. Their testimonies can also be found with a simple search. \n\nShe stole many of her policies from Trump, right when something she stands for becomes unpopular she acts like she was never a part of it. Her other policies such as giving young adults money from the taxpayers to buy houses has already been proven to not work as sellers will simply increase the price of housing. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what she is doing in the slightest, everything she says publicly is read from a screen given to her by her cabal behind her.

Again anal sex or two women bumping vaginas is NOT normal. The male has a penis to go inside of a vagina. God said be fruitful and multiply. Can the same sex do that? Its clear in the bible that, \" men will leave the natural use of a woman!!\" Which means they rather have anal sex with a man. Homosexuality is a abomination, and to the people he do not change, he also mention he will turn them over to a reprobated mind, meaning he's going to let you do what you want to do and you will believe your own lies. Once God does that you are damned forever because that's also disrespecting the Holy Spirit. If God keeps telling you to change and you don't do it, his spirit is going to stop trying to pull you in because you've gone too far, and won't listen.

The Bible does say once we go to heaven, we will be there for , what was it 100 thousand years? And then a new Heaven and New earth will be where believers go to live after Earth sustains its damage. I know it can be a challenge to understand the Bible, but the key is to understand it exactly as it is and not according to what we want it to say. I like to find at least three scriptures to fully back up my beliefs but I know that might not always be the case. Often there are more! Have you tried listening to the Holy Spirit/Jesus? He does speak to us esp if we listen. The disciples believed the blind man was blind because of his parent\u2019s sin didn\u2019t they? They believed, like how they did in the Old Testament, that sin was the cause of disease. But Jesus took upon himself, all our disease and sin.

{"text": "you can try r/TrueChristian  for more biblically sound advice.\n\nWhen it comes to lust I find that the only way for the mind to start healing is to try and go cold turkey out of anything that can be considered sexual, especially things that trigger you. It's hard, expect to fail a lot at first but with me despite all the failures I have noticed a change in my thinking when it comes to this sort of stuff.\n\nBasically your best bet is to try as best you can to desexualise your mind and that starts with realizing that with lust your eyes are your window to the hearth. What you see affects you and that includes movies, video games, anything that can trigger you. I personally skip anything sexual when I watch tv series for example it's just a thing I do. \n\nKeeping yourself busy is very important during this period, cause like it or not we tend to do a lot of dumb things out of sheer boredom. If you have friends or family you can talk to, in a pure social aspect, try to socialize as much as you can with them. Closing yourself off will lead to depression and then lust. \n\nYou can pray about it. God can minimize those lustful feelings and thoughts. The bible tells us that we should capture every thought. The manifistation starts with a floating thought the trick is not to linger on it and let it take root, cause once it does it grows stronger and stronger until you fail. \n\nFor a first step you can pray to Jesus right now and ask him to help you with the fight against lust. I remember praying something in the lines of 'please inspect my every thought' asking him to basically stop anything that does not belong there.\n\nAlso keep in mind that ultimately all sin is a form of spiritual warfare against you. You can't be blind to the fact that there is an invisible enemy that will do anything in its power to distract you and keep you far away from God. Praying a prayer for spiritual warfare a day can help and it can be something as simple as simply calling on Jesus's name.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The following extracts might work (taken from gotquestions.org):\n\nMore often than not, Christians are said to be homophobic simply because they condemn homosexual behavior as sin. But the fact is that the term homophobic is merely a word used by homosexual activists and supporters in their attempts to deflect a genuine criticism of an immoral and unhealthy practice. Without question, there are people and organizations who have developed an irrational hate of homosexuals and who are prepared to use violent actions to inflict suffering upon homosexuals. However, the problem is that the homosexual-rights activists have accused anyone who opposes homosexuality of harboring similar hatred. Therefore, Christians who rightly discern that homosexuality is an unnatural sin are equated with violent lunatics who hate for hatred\u2019s sake.\n\nWhile the Bible strongly condemns homosexuality, it never instructs that homosexuals are to be hated. As Christians, we are to speak out against the perversion of homosexual activity. The Bible is explicit in its condemnation of it, as well as God\u2019s wrath towards those who practice such behavior. As Christians, we are called to clearly and lovingly call sin for what it is. Using the term homophobia to refer to anyone who opposes homosexuality is a distraction, not a valid argument or accurate representation. A Christian should have only one fear regarding homosexuals, the fear that they will suffer eternally because of their decision to reject the only means of salvation\u2014the Lord Jesus Christ who offers the only hope for escape from a degrading and destructive lifestyle.\nConversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy, is a blanket term used to describe various methods to \u201ccure\u201d people of homosexuality. In the past century, various psychiatrists, Christian and non-Christian, have proposed techniques for \u201cconverting\u201d a homosexual into a heterosexual. In recent years, the psychiatric community has begun to strongly oppose conversion therapy, declaring it to be psychologically and emotionally harmful. Even some Christian groups that formerly advocated Bible-focused methods of conversion/reparative therapy have abandoned the efforts. Is conversion therapy biblical?\n\nThe Bible clearly declares homosexuality to be a sin (Romans 1:26\u201327; 1 Corinthians 6:9) and that any sin can, with God\u2019s help, be overcome (Romans 6:17\u201318; 1 Corinthians 6:11; James 4:7\u20138). However, the Bible does not give a specific methodology for overcoming any particular sin. There is no 5-step process for gaining victory over lying. There is no 11-step program for defeating an addiction to pornography or sexual immorality. There is no silver bullet. There is no magic potion. Sin, especially sexual sin, is multi-faceted, and behavior modification is not the solution. There must be heart change that can only come by the power of God.\n\nSo, conversion therapy cannot be said to be explicitly biblically based. What has been done to some homosexuals in the name of conversion therapy is absolutely unbiblical and even abusive. Electro-shock therapy, nausea-inducing drugs, exposure to heterosexual pornography\u2014such things contradict what the Bible teaches about how to help someone overcome temptation. If a particular method of conversion therapy is devoid of biblical truth, it is nothing but junk psychology.\n\nBut a rejection of the specific methods used in conversion/reparative therapy is not the same thing as surrendering to the idea that homosexuality cannot be overcome. There are literally thousands of individuals who have achieved lasting victory over homosexual tendencies and temptations through faith in Jesus Christ. Far more important than testimonials is the biblical teaching that sin can be overcome. To say that faith in Jesus Christ, a commitment to obeying God\u2019s Word, and a reliance on the power of the Holy Spirit cannot produce victory over sin is an affront to the love and power of God. At the same time, the ultimate goal for the homosexual is not to become heterosexual. The goal is holiness and glorifying God in all that he or she does. Those surrendered to God will live by denying themselves, taking up their cross, and following Christ (Matthew 16:24\u201326).\n\nSins, including homosexuality, can be overcome. Paul reminded the believers in Corinth that, before they received Christ, some of them were homosexuals, \u201cbut you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:11). Their homosexuality was a sin of the past, and they had abandoned that sin by the grace of God. Only when we are new creations in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) can our sin natures be defeated. Only when we truly experience conversion to Christ can any true reparative process begin (Romans 12:1\u20132).\n\nPodcast on conversion therapy: https://www.ccef.org/podcast/how-do-we-think-biblically-about-conversion-therapy", "label": 1}

{"text": "1. Psalm 22 and Jesus\u2019 Humanity: When Jesus quoted Psalm 22 on the cross, saying, \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d It reflects a cry of distress and dependence on God. This doesn\u2019t suggest divinity but rather his experience of human suffering and his reliance on God.\n\t2. Instances of Worship: In the Bible, there are moments where people show reverence to Jesus, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they worshiped him as God. In Matthew 2:11, for example, when the Magi \u201cbowed down\u201d to the infant Jesus, this was a common cultural gesture of respect and honor, often given to kings or prophets, not a declaration of divinity.\n\t3. Thomas\u2019 Declaration: When Thomas exclaimed, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d (John 20:28), some interpret this as recognizing Jesus\u2019 divinity. But another interpretation is that Thomas, in astonishment, was acknowledging the miracle of the resurrection, not necessarily equating Jesus with the Almighty God.\n\t4. Hosanna and Palm Sunday: In Matthew 21:9, people cried \u201cHosanna\u201d to Jesus, which means \u201cSave us!\u201d This phrase reflects a plea for help, often directed at a messianic figure, but not necessarily as worship of God. Many believed Jesus was the Messiah sent by God, which is not the same as believing he was God himself.\n\t5. Islamic Perspective on Jesus: Islam views Jesus (Isa) as a revered prophet who called people to worship the one true God. In Islam, worship is reserved for God alone, not for any human, prophet, or created being. This strict monotheism aligns with Jesus\u2019 teachings to worship only God, as he said in Mark 12:29, \u201cThe Lord our God, the Lord is one.\u201d\n\nIn summary, while Jesus was deeply honored, the examples you shared can also be understood as acts of respect rather than affirmations of his divinity. Jesus\u2019 mission, as Muslims believe, was to call people to worship God alone, not himself or any other being.\nSon of God: A Broader Context\n\nIn the Bible, the term \u201cSon of God\u201d is not only\nused to refer to Jesus but also to the prophets\nand to believers in general. This term reflects a\nspecial spiritual relationship with God, not\ninherent divinity. Many verses affirm this\nconcept:\nDavid: In Psalm 2:7, God says to David,\n\u201cYou are My Son, today I have begotten\nyou\u201d\nJacob (Israel): In Exodus 4:22-23, God says to\nMoses, \u201cThus says the Lord: Israel is My son,\nMy firstborn.\u201d\nSolomon: In 2 Samuel 7:14, God speaks of\nSolomon saying, \u201cI will be his Father, and he\nshall be My son.\u201d\nAdam: Adam is referred to as the \u201cSon of\nGod\u201d in Luke 3:38 in the genealogy of Jesus.\nHosea: In Hosea 1:10, God refers to the\nchildren of Israel, saying, \u201cIn the place where\nit was said to them, \u2018You are not My people,\u2019\nthere it shall be said to them, \u2018You are sons of\nthe living God.\u2019\u201d\nThese texts show that the term \u201cSon of God\u201d\napplies broadly to those who follow God\u2019s\nteachings and submit to His will.\nOther Examples of Sons of God in the Bible:\nAll believers: As stated in Romans 8:14, \u201cFor\nas many as are led by the Spirit of God, these\nare sons of God.\u201d\nAngels: In Job 1:6 and Job 38:7, angels are\nreferred to as \u201csons of God.\u201d\nEphraim: In Jeremiah 31:9, Ephraim is\nreferred to as God\u2019s son: \u201cFor I am a Father to\nIsrael, and Ephraim is My firstborn.\u201d\nThese verses show that the concept of being \u201ca\nson of God\u201d broadly applies to those who follow\nGod\u2019s teachings and submit to His will.", "label": 1}

{"text": "In your comment, you mentioned \u201cthe differences were musical,\u201d let me clarify that in Arabic there are different dialects and recitations (same meaning of the word but different pronunciations like how Americans say \u201cwater\u201d and the British say \u201cwater\u201d sometimes mocking each other saying their pronunciation of letters is better),So each tribe started claiming that the pronunciation of their recitation of the Quran was better than others, and they disagreed until Caliph Uthman ordered the compilation of the written Quranic texts from Hafsa and instructed the Quran to be written with the pronunciation in which it was revealed, the pronunciation of the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quraysh, Since then, the recitation has been unified.\n\nYou mentioned the verse but didn\u2019t mention the context:\nYou referred to Surah 5:47: \u201cLet the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein, and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed those are the defiantly disobedient.\u201d\nBut the context is in the following verse:\n\u201cWe have revealed to you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. \u201cSo judge between them by what Allah has revealed(to you), and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a way of life. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you one nation, but He intended to test you in what He has given you. So race to [do] good works. To Allah is your return all together, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\u201d\nHere Allah is saying that Muhammad should judge them by the Quran, which was revealed to him and is a guardian over their scriptures. The Gospel they had was altered and distorted, as Jesus spoke Aramaic, and the Gospel was written in Greek 90 years after his death. The first Gospel is the Gospel of John , and those who wrote it are unknown historically. We do not know anything about them, and they were not eyewitnesses (Matthew, Mark, John, Luke).\n\nAlso there a Bergenham quran manuscript, it is one of the ancient manuscripts dating back to the time of the Prophet Muhammad and is considered one of the oldest Quranic copies preserved from the early period after the revelation. This manuscript, like many other Quranic manuscripts, shows that the Quran was preserved accurately without change or distortion. Moreover, the Quran has been preserved in the hearts of people since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, where the companions and It is passed down from generation to generation. This oral tradition continued, and today the number of people who have memorized the Quran exceeds 15 million around the world.\n\nAgain, I advise you to read the Quran to gain genuine knowledge and live culture. Don\u2019t just copy-paste responses from hostile, from anti Islam sites.\nRead it for culture, read it for pleasure; the important thing is to read and understand, and don\u2019t remain ignorant. Do not worship humans, the dead, monkeys, or idols as mentioned in the Bible. (Deuteronomy 6:4-15) O Israel: The Lord our God is one (not trinity 3 gods )\nAlso, in the Bible, Jesus was a messenger from God:\n\u201cThe God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus\u201d (Acts 3:13).", "label": 1}
