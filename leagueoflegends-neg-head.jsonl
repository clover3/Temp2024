He can and will make you take a ton of tower shots with R+E+slow.\n\nFighting him with the same strategies he uses, if you have the cc and sustain for it, is a good option.

{"text": "Because the whole appeal of pro play that riot has said themselves is to be able to do what you see the pros doing. Things like lane swaps are not doable in solo queue because no comms so the game is essentially completely different. You also seem to forget that someone has to be the \"victim\" in all of these strats. In the case of lane swaps top laners are completely irrelevant for the first 5-10 minutes. Do you really think even if comms are added to solo queue anyone would willingly ruin their entire early game and fun to trust their random teammates to carry? And I'm sure bot laners would very quickly get bored of having uncontested lanes and essentially identical early games every single game. By that point it just turns into which bot lane can carry harder after 14 mins so what would even be the point of having the early game, might as well just spawn in at 14 mins and get it over with. \n\nSo basically, most people don't like watching this every single game, they can't replicate things their favorite teams are doing and if this does creep into solo queue you are essentially removing top lane, bot lane matchups and the early game in general from the game. It's ironic asking for a shake up when nearly every single pro game follows the same exact lane swap formula now and is essentially \"solved\".", "label": 0}

{"text": "\"You don't have to int to play around these concepts\" \n\n  \nSion is quite possibly one of the weakest early game characters in the game, to the point that its not uncommon for sion to be down a large amount of cs, get frozen on, and ganked anyway. Baus avoids all of this by dying on purpose. He gets wave under turret so its not frozen, forces enemy to chase him around so they lose cs (while he gets the whole wave), damages turret for plate that a frozen sion would never get, and chunks the enemy top laner in passive.\n\nThis usually results in the enemy top laner being 1/2hp when sion returns, so Baus can shove the wave and get the plate causing the enemy to lose an entire wave when they recall. Baus secures 1 1/2 plates and gets the full wave, effectively going even in gold while scaling with his W passive and inherent late game character. \n\n  \n\"Pressure and tempo are basic concepts that literally anyone can play around\"\n\nYes, except sion can't unless you are Baus. Renekton can create pressure and tempo because he has kill threat on you at all times, same for half a dozen other top lane characters. Baus HAS to int to play around these concepts because his champion is fucking terrible early game, and it works. He often has the same amount of gold as the enemy top laner if not more, and the reason his team does so well ALL THE TIME is because the enemy jg focuses purely topside while Baus' jungler gets free reign on enemy bot lane. It doesn't matter to Baus if the jg camps him because he is going to shove the wave and chunk someone (or even kill them) regardless of if he gets ganked or not. Yeah he has bad games, and it looks worse because his strategy already involves dying so of course his kda will be worse.\n\nSo tell me again how does he not have to int to play around these concepts? He got challenger korea with ad sion, and has repeatedly been high elo despite being target nerfed for over a year or more. His strategy works, he's just the only one who can do it.", "label": 0}

Genesis Nightbringer Yasuo lands on the ground before his target, regular Nightbringer doesnt behave like this.\n* **Video / Screenshot:**\n   * \u00a0Genesis Nightbringer Airblade (EQR):\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoPxsnxkT7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoPxsnxkT7A)\u00a0\n   * Nightbringer Airblade (EQR):\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcMVLubTuJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcMVLubTuJg)\n* **Steps to reproduce:**\u00a0Perform Airblade on both skins to compare. Throw Q3 -> EQ -> R on a target to transer the Spin Q\n* **Expected result:**\u00a0Animation should be the same as Nightbringer Yasuo since all the animations are or should be the same\n* **Observed result:**\u00a0Animation differs from regular Nightbringer Yasuo and ends to early/swings the sword to fast down making Yasuo land on the ground about 0.5 seconds before his target. regular Nightbringer doesnt behave like this.\n* **Reproduction rate:**\u00a0100%\n* **System specs:**\u00a0dont matter for this\n\nThe bug doesnt greatly impact gameplay. But does feel very unsmooth since Yasuo is stuck for about 0.5 Seconds. Airblade is one of the Combos making the champ who he is and is a big part of his gameplay. Yasuo players/mains would greatly appreciate if this would be fixed since the skin is pricey and shouldnt have bugged animations.\n\nThis Visual/Animation Bug has been reported multiple times in the PBE Feedback thread for the Genesis Nightbringer Yasuo skin, but was ignored and never fixed.

Getting AD from an ability is strictly worse than having it on base. Plus abilities with passives tend to be weaker than other abilities. \n\nConsider akshan. He passively does a million things, but his active abilities are kinda ass. His ult is one of the worst in the game, his W active while cheap has such a large reveal range and no MS without his passive means that it's kinda impractical most of the time. \n\nHis Q is decent but just tickles most champs and is mostly to proc his passive and give MS leaving his E as his only genuinely good active. \n\nSo, in exchange for amazingly strong passives his about 2 approximately average abilities. That's not what I'd call free. \n\nNow, to be clear, I am not calling Akshan a weak champ because of this. My point is that there's no such thing as free stats and effects.

{"text": "Deft went to high school with Faker and they got into League around the same time, but while the latter had a meteoric rise to the top, Deft had to grind for a long time for his win. He was always regarded as one of the best ADs in the world and had very strong domestic results on great teams like SSB, EDG and KT, winning multiple titles including multiple wins against Uzi's RNG and even an MSI win against SKT in 2015. \n\nUnfortunately, he never seemed to be able to replicate his form or success at Worlds. In his first year at Worlds, he made semis with Samsung Blue but got swept in the semis by his sister team, Samsung White. That would be the only time in the next eight years that he'd make it past the quarterfinals. As his career progressed, Deft was still a great player, but got stuck on worse and worse teams. After years of failure due to a mix of chokes, disappointing performances, unlucky draws, and mediocre teammates, it seemed like he was never really going to get another real chance to lift the Worlds trophy.\n\nOn DRX, probably the worst team he had ever played with on paper, Deft barely scraped his way into Worlds 2022 as LCK's fourth seed. Not a single sane person on the planet would've predicted DRX to even have a chance at making a competitive run, much less winning the entire competition, so expectations were obviously low. DRX made quick work of the play-ins teams and got drawn into the easiest group of the tournament, which they capitalized on, topping their group and making it into the top 8. After the knockout stage bracket was determined, DRX's run looked nigh impossible, starting with EDG, the defending world champions, and likely GENG in semis followed by JDG/T1 in the finals. Not only that, but Deft had history with every single team he was facing, having previously played with Scout/Meiko on EDG and Chovy/Doran/Keria on DRX, as well as competing against Faker for his entire competitive career.\n\nDRX tragically dropped to 0-2 in the series against EDG after an unbelievably unlucky ending to game 2 that honestly made it seem like Deft was meant to never win. With the odds stacked against them, after a defeat that would crush the morale of most teams, and staring down the barrel of yet another quarterfinals exit, Deft and the rest of DRX rallied and reverse swept EDG on the back of an incredible performance from Zeka. They rode their momentum into semis, beating GENG 3-1, and finally faced off against T1, who many people predicted would comfortably sweep DRX. DRX ended up pushing T1 to silver scrapes and miraculously emerged victorious in what is probably both the greatest Bo5 series and greatest Worlds upset of all time, becoming the first fourth seed to win Worlds and finally giving Deft his long-awaited Worlds trophy.\n\nHope that helped! There's probably already a better and/or more detailed summary of his career elsewhere if you search for it. The [Worlds 2022 finals teaser](https://youtu.be/BpO5bZEzVzI?t=115) also covers some of his story as well.", "label": 0}

{"text": "So, normally on other champs you need to spend 6 seconds to recall and you spend 10 to >50 seconds on grey screen when you die depending on level. Well Sion passive lasts longer than death timers pre-\u00a0 lvl 7 (used to be higher), so he can CS, get a plate, and return kill during what is supposed to be his grey screen after you kill him. When his passive runs out, he instantly respawns in base. So now you've CS'd and backed with your gold, but you didnt need to spend either 6 or 10+ seconds doing so.\n\n\nMinions spawn every 30 seconds, and if playing normally, sometimes you have to give up one of those waves to back or because you died. Sion wouldn't miss that wave. Sion with TP missed them even less. Literally by 10 minutes into a match, a well played inting sion is up 20 CS worth of exp, and likely up in gold due to towers.\u00a0\n\n\nPlus your 8th kill in a row against an inting sion would give you like 120 gold, not 300. So you have a 1k bounty, he has all the tower plates and 11 CS per minute because despite you killing him 8 times he never missed a wave.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Even Baus who has essentially invented the strat interacts with lane opponents a lot. I'd argue you are saying to play it perfectly, not correctly. Saying 'if pigs fly' doesn't really make the debate any better, we should be talking about actually feasible scenarios when judging a strategy. Sure, Baus can have prio after first 2-3 waves then go proxy, but often his opponents still chase him down and kill him. With the old bounty system this could actually be the less ideal play for the enemy, but it's what happened more often than not even in challenger. If your ideal strategy involves the enemy playing ideally to your strategy then it isn't your strategy, it's just a gameplan that almost never works out. Basically it feels pointless to argue about this point since it never happens the way you call 'correct.'", "label": 0}

There's times when you'll see a much larger OR smaller range than the actual current range.\n\nThe way WW's kit is designed is like they wanted him to have bugs, Q is a really unique problem to code and one of the few abilities that changes on how you press the button, W relies on a global pathfinding trail, his E well it just has no business stopping WW from fighting, and his R relies on turning yourself into a skillshot that relies on champion hitbox AND your own hitbox AND the range can change on a dime.\n\nThis is all on top of WW having a problematic design: Drain Tank that wants On Hit Itemization but does Hybrid Damage, but his ability scale scale best with AD. Riot doesn't like sustain. Doesn't like standard onhit itemization for bruisers (they prefer ability on hit like Sheen), and Bruiser/Hybrid Damage itemization is also very niche in general. WW doesn't even have an AoE ability, but it is designed for Jungling. It's like they wanted to give him every design problem possible.\n\nI really like the concept Wild Rift used for WW's ult. WW dashes to wherever the mouse is (according to the current allowed range), and his next auto is empowered to supress. It fixes WW having to rely on a buggy skillshot and makes his ultimate something he can rely on working in his favor.", "label": 0}
