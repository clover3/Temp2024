And seen the behavior in action too.\n\nAnd I know from 10 years experience with Destiny 1 and 2 how much downhill a game can get in the social aspect if everything gets matchmaking and doesn't require groups anymore.\n\nDestiny 1 (still is) used to be the game where I had 100 friends in my Xbox FL (the limit at that time) which 40 of those regularly wanting to play with me, the other 60 occasionally asking for help at times.\n\nThat friend list basically dissolved over the first year launch experience of Destiny 2, because everything except endgame PvP 3v3 and Raids had matchmaking. Alongside other issues. And my online social life in that game never really recovered ever again from that blow.\n\nAgain, I know from experience how fast people rather stick to themselves instead of socializing if they have no need to anymore. There is an entire topic of science about this behavior, based on human evolution history.\n\n[Tribalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism)\n\nAll you have to do is looking at the guild/LFG history compared between classic 2004 and todays retail. Back then **you had to be social** and in most cases it was good and rewarding to be social in the game. Today? You barely get a \"Hello\" from other people in Dungeon Finder.\n\n[Half of the games population behaves like bots that have 0 instructions how to interact with each other.](https://youtu.be/E7pnseIm5mY?si=8U7QN7kQkPuwcfFv)", "label": 0}

{"text": "Hey there, welcome (back) to WoW!\n\n> Per the suggestion of a friend I boosted my character and started fresh in the War Within.\n\nThis is usually bad advice for anyone completely new to the game, but if you still have some (however minor) experience from when you last played, then it's probably fine.\n\n> It took me awhile however to realize that the dungeons were just available whenever and not tied to the story. I went through each of them roughly where I thought they might fit into the story but honestly I wish they had some more direct narrative tie in. \n\nFWIW, they used to tie into each zone's story more. They would often be the capstone for a zone's story. Other times, they would be out of the way and not be involved in the story at all, and you might stumble up on a random NPC somewhere who sends you to the dungeon because they have beef with one of the bosses. I personally like both approaches because I always like exploration in games, and there was an era when a dungeon that was out of the way and didn't connect to any major story had an aura of mystery to it.\n\nNowadays, while there are still a few examples in older expansions of long zone stories leading to a dungeon, Blizzard's recent approach is to stick NPCs in the entrance of a dungeon who have the quests for said dungeon. \n\n> [...] or if dungeons need ilvl synching like FFXIV has or what.\n\nNot taking into account ilvl, there is some level scaling that happens in normal dungeons because you can get grouped with players well below or above your level. In these cases, the scaling was always a bit weird because lower level characters would do exponentially more damage than high level characters. That said, Blizzard changed how scaling works this week (everything used to scale down to the content's original level. Now, everything scales up to max level I think), and I don't know how it has affected relative player power in scaled situations.\n\nHowever, more recently, scaling has been viewed a bit more negative in terms of content scaling up to your level. As you level up, your stats give less benefit per point. If you're fighting a monster, and you level up, but the monster scales up to your level, you're suddenly doing less damage and taking more damage before. No one wants to feel like they're getting weaker as they level up. I leveled my prot warrior from 70 to 80 this week. I went from feeling unstoppable at 70 to feeling much squishier at 79 in the same dungeon content.\n\nObviously, things are different with ilvl scaling vs level scaling, but the point still stands that people don't want to feel weaker over time doing the same content.\n\n> I would get queued in a dungeon where it seemed I was so underheated/leveled compared to the rest of the party that I couldn't actually contribute and I actually apologized and left several of these parties because it just didn't feel like I was actually helping.\n\nI mainly play healers. In my plethora of alts that I've leveled through dungeon spam, I don't think I've *ever* had a situation where I felt like my heals were not contributing. Weaker? Yes, as they got closer to max level and the scaling was kicking in, but never ineffective. For groups that were roflstomping the content, I was doing great damage because of (once again) weird scaling, but I never felt like my heals weren't doing anything. Your experience is interesting, to say the least.", "label": 0}

This is a 90 dollar OR a 3 mil gold mount. And 3 million gold is extremely reasonable for this. If you want to earn it in game. You can.

For reference im a player who benefits massively by the token existing as I havnt payed for the game in years (boosting for gold). And im still against it. \n\nTldr.

Market is predatory but it also plays with some rules because costumers have needs and opinions. You might rush for profit as a small company but it will crash in the big run. \n\nYour opinion is valid, people not buying this mount might be a signal. But if it's a sucess, doesn't imply that Blizzard then will start to make pay-to-wins and paywalls movements.

Healer drinking isn't an issue at all if people are playing well, there's far less damage going out in higher keys ironically, because people are actually interupting/stunning the packs and using defensives which means healer mana usually stays pretty healthy throughout.", "label": 0}
