As part of that identity, defensive players celebrate big plays by putting a hand to their forehead in the shape of a shark fin. A battle cry of \u201cFins Up\u201d also contributes to the players\u2019 persona.\n\n>Roots of the Landshark at Ole Miss date back to 2008. After four straight losing seasons, the Rebel football team returned to national prominence with a 9-4 record and a victory over No. 7 Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl. Leading the charge was a defensive squad that ranked fourth in the nation in rushing defense and included All-American Peria Jerry and eventual All-SEC standout Jerrell Powe. The term Landshark originated that season from senior linebacker Tony Fein, an Army veteran who served a one-year tour in the Iraq War before arriving in Oxford. A two-year letterman after transferring from Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College, Fein was the 2008 recipient of the Pat Tillman Award by the Military Order of the Purple Heart.\n\n>Fein passed away in October 2009, but his legacy at Ole Miss continues through the Landshark.", "label": 1}

Not insults about Fsu, but about him. Recently I've seen him called \"vile scum\", asshole, loser, etc and that he should be punched in the dick and spat on. \n\nI get the irritation by fsu's rival fans, but all he did was post articles nagging his rival's teams. The vitriol reaction to him as a person is weirder to me. \n\nPeople are outraged that he doesn't want to come back to the sub for the sole purpose so they can to be scream at him and call him a loser lol.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Yeah, mods deleted my post from a few weeks ago similar to the AllHawkeyes post. That was my point - PFB was a shitposter, but he didn't really engage with people in the comments. I think with Irishspring is doing is 10/10 mockery because everyone who spends a lot of time on this sub knows these are PFB-style articles without actually broadcasting PFB. That and the vitriol that appears in some of the comments is textbook cyber bullying.", "label": 1}

If you added 40k plus seats the minimum price for that game would plummet which is why looking at the minimum ticket price without taking into account stadium capacity is a dumb way to compare games.", "label": 1}
