{"text": "Copying from u/sbiggers.\n\nThis is an utter false equivalency that you should stop propagating now.\n\nThe IDF must answer to some Geneva convention violations that have taken place over decades and still now during this conflict, but that doesn\u2019t make the IDF a terror org or Israelis terrorists. The truth is that most urban warfare involves Geneva convention violations - even Ukraine is contending with this in a far less complicated environment. Terrorists, on the other hand, are organized groups with the *intended purpose* to incite terror for ideological gain by targeting civilians. Just so we\u2019re clear.\n\nIt\u2019s a false equivalency that Israel and Hamas/Hezbollah are the same because:\n- Hamas/Hezbollah serve as Iranian Regime proxies, and the Iranian Regime is the most oppressively Islamist and jihadist whacko terrorist regime out there. IDF is not a proxy army of any bigger cause or larger terror org.\n- Hamas and Hezbollah are quite literally designated as terrorist orgs by most developed countries who have strong military intel, and many global organizations. The IDF is not. \n- Hamas/Hezbollah have always actively targeted civilians. Not civilians caught in crossfire, not civilians because it\u2019s urban warfare with targets embedded in civilian structures, not bad intel, not a handful of rogue agents making bad decisions, but mission-based active targeting of civilians for the purpose of causing terror. IDF does not.\n- Hamas/Hezbollah leadership have openly stated their goal is kill as many Israelis and Jews as possible throughout the last 30-40 years. Over and over again. IDF leadership has not said that about the Palestinian or Lebanese.\n- UN resolution 1701 meant Israel would leave and Lebanon wouldn\u2019t bomb anymore / would entirely vacate leadership for good. No more Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel did their part and left, Hezbollah never did. Which one is intending to cause more terror?\n- The IDF has provided metric tons of aid to the civilians that you\u2019re suggesting are the target of their terror? Lots of issues surrounding aid delivery execution but that hardly indicates TERRORISTS.\n- Israeli and IDF leadership are elected. They have laws. IDF members are monitored and punished to the full extent of the law with jail time when they go rogue. Israeli civilians themselves protest en masse against Netanyahu and this govt\u2019s more hard line stances and he will be tossed out come election time. With Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iranian regime, protesting is not an option. Elections aren\u2019t an option. Disagreement is not an option. Civilians are routinely tortured, raped, and executed for publicly speaking out against their own govt. And members of Hamas or Hezbollah who seek out chances to terrorize, torture and murder Jews/Israelis/anybody who conflicts with their radical Islamist ideology (women who don\u2019t cover up, queer people, etc.) are celebrated \u2014 BECAUSE TERROR IS THEIR PURPOSE. \n- Since Isreal\u2019s inception, an inception that was greatly contested and disruptive but wasn\u2019t very different from the way most other countries were created and ultimately was ratified and formalized and is done, Israel has been on the receiving end of constant organized attacks for being Jewish. That\u2019s quite literally what the formal mission behind all the attacks were about and you can see the documents or watch the clips proving so. \u201cWe will never recognize a Jewish state.\u201d The IDF has always responded or proactively responded, not instigated. Proportional response is not terror. \n- As we see now in Lebanon, the IDF is capable of (and prefers to use) insanely precise methods of killing terrorists with minimal civilian casualties - since zero is an unfair expectation. This further proves that they don\u2019t have the option for this approach in Gaza because of the tunnels and the way Hamas has embedded their targets in civilian infrastructure, which was entirely Hamas\u2019 point in creating such a setup. You\u2019re upset so many civilians have gotten caught in bombs and air strikes? Good. You should be. That was not a silly goofy mistake but Hamas\u2019 intended setup.\n- If the IDF is a terror org, who are the civilians they\u2019re intentionally terrorizing? Palestinians? Arabs? Non Jews? Hard sell given 20% of Israelis are Arabs. Harder sell given they\u2019ve offered Palestine a formal sovereign statehood free from Israeli leadership 20+ times.\n\nLet me ask you this - the US was founded on Native land and also took land from Mexico. It\u2019s fucked up. Even still, do you hear from Native leadership that they want to end all Americans? Blow us all to smithereens because we took their land? Does the Mexican govt want to eliminate America and see millions of us die? Do they want to pair up together to bomb Texas with thousands of bombs for years and then infiltrate a Texas music festival to kill 1000+ Americans who are just hanging out and partying and take hundreds back across the border to keep them hostage / torture them / kill them? Would you expect the US to not retaliate just because we were in the wrong in the past and are militarily stronger now?\n\nLet\u2019s think comparable timeline: Do Jews, or Israelis, have an organized missions to destroy Germany and terrorize Germans because 6 million were exterminated by their government 80 years ago and want to see Jewish retribution? \n\nNope. And the reason it isn\u2019t happening is because there is no ideological purpose for those actions the way that Hamas has an ideological purpose to create terror amongst Jews/Israelis (\u201celiminate all Jews\u201d \u201cnever allow a Jewish state\u201d) and the Iranian Regime has a larger ideological purpose of destroying all western society to replace with an Islamist theocracy similar to Iran. \n\nThe IDF has to answer for some shit. Israeli leadership needs to be cleansed. \u201cBoth sides are awful terrorists\u201d is a false equivalency.", "label": 1}

I think as we continue to watch the UN be a largely useless organization, more stories like this are going to come out, adding to the narrative that the UN does more harm than good. It's unfortunate because I think the UN is a largely necessary organization, despite its flaws, but it's also hard to ignore the fact that the UN is basically doing this to itself at this point. \n\nAfter seeing how heavily infiltrated UN organizations can be in Israel, and now in Ukraine, there's no way that in the future a country like South Korea would ever let the UN play a large role in a hypothetical armistice with North Korea, or that Ukraine would trust the UN to maintain a demilitarized zone between it and Russia, or that Japan would ever count on the UN to help settle a maritime dispute with China.

{"text": "With regards to liability and evidence that hospitals are increasingly turning pregnant women away in anti-abortion red states, you're going to have to look at  investigative journalism and recent news coverage, as well as criticism of anti-abortion laws by physicians.\n\nThe article you referred to is a very general consensus statement referring to *all* serious infections in pregnant women.  This was an infection in or affecting her uterus and the fetus, and sepsis that lead to the death of the fetus which then would have been a very dangerous situation - having a dead fetus inside an infected uterus is a life-threatening emergency.  You linked a very very general document about all kinds of infections (pneumonia, etc) in pregnant women.  And you may notice that even there, the consensus statement states more than once that *\"Although the effects of maternal therapy on the fetus should be considered, treatment of the mother has first priority.\"*\n\nSo yes, you can treat infections and sepsis in pregnant women without removing the fetus.  That's true for most cases - sepsis or infection in pregnancy isn't hugely uncommon.\n\nThis is a very specific case where 1st hospital did not check her uterus despite abdominal pain, and did not diagnose sepsis.  It's speculation that was due to avoidance of liability or dealing with pregnancy, but investigative journalism, news reports, and reports by physicians have all confirmed that this is becoming common in red states.\n\nThe 2nd hospital diagnosed her with sepsis, but did not admit her for observation or do more testing or schedule follow-up.  This is completely against all recommendations of the document you linked, btw.  We have no idea what would have happened had she been admitted and staff had reacted proactively, but it's possible her fetus could have been saved with aggressive treatment for sepsis.  It's very possible, even likely, that she would have lived.\n\nThe 3rd hospital knew she had sepsis.  They waited to US the fetus (despite high likelihood the fetus was deceased), found that the fetus was deceased, and then waited hours to ultrasound the deceased fetus *again* to confirm.\n\nSo this isn't typical infection or sepsis in a pregnant woman.  This was sepsis in a pregnant women with a dead fetus inside of her uterus.  At that point, yes, it's a medical emergency and the deceased fetus must be removed.  This is a VERY different situation than the general paper about infection in pregnancy you linked.    \n  \nI don't mean to put this in a gruesome or explicit manner, but at that point you have an immune-compromised (from pregnancy) woman with a raging infection, and you have a deceased fetus inside of her organs decomposing and feeding bacterial infection with absolutely no protection from the rest of her internal organs and body.  It would be the same (not emotionally, of course) but in terms of infection if you had part of your intestines die - it would need to be removed, ASAP, because it's a huge infection risk as it rots and breaks down and feeds bacteria inside of you.  And that's without everything else about pregnancy that compromises a woman's body, like the typical downregulation of the immune system during pregnancy.\n\nThe best evidence you can find is looking up the evidence and sources I mentioned at the top on the huge impact of anti-abortion legislation in red states on women's healthcare.     \n  \nThe explanation of sepsis comes from my background as a medical student with a STEM MSc prior to medical school.  It's great that you looked for sources about sepsis, but it's difficult without the medical background to interpret the application there, and unfortunately, the situation mentioned here is MUCH more specific than those general guidelines.", "label": 1}

One of the key indicators of D/R votes was whether or not you lived in an area that saw average wages increase faster than inflation.

Texas saw money and went \"yup, that's your kid unless you do a DNA test\". The place sent me a letter and an appointment saying \"we're going to explain what's going on and see what options we have\". I show up and it's employed by 100% women. All of them extremely hostile to men, regardless of race. I go in and she pulls out a swab. No questions, nothing. I nope on out of there and lawyer up.\n\nMy feminist friends told me I was a piece of shit trying to dodge my responsibility instead of just owning it. I was told if I couldn't afford my medications because of child support then I was better off dead for the child's benefit anyways - this by many feminists and folks all over. The same people who now claim to want \"equality\" or \"equity\". When we found out the kid wasn't mine - not one single apology.\n\nSo.. now that women are dying because of their situation and magically I'm supposed to care? About the same people that were mean and hostile to me? Hey, I'm just one person. Surely my vote alone isn't a problem. Clearly I'm not alone, even though Reddit wants me to think I am. So forgive me if I'm \"too casual\" about the situation because it's not like any of you cared about *me* in the history of ever. And I'm not alone in that thought process.\n\nIt's funny how Democrats care about women dying because of this... and yet none of them care about how men survive, or don't survive. They don't care about life. Have any of you sincerely sat and for a few minutes wondered *why* you don't care about white men? Or men in general? Because real life isn't tit for tat if you want a better future. I can tell you the Democrats come across as though I'm viewed as enemy number one. I'm from Texas so, of course, I *HAVE* to be racist and sexist, right? There's, literally, nothing else I can be, huh?\n\nNow if they want to become a party of equality, I'm all in. Until then... ... and to convince me they are going to have to learn to communicate and engage in healthy dialog.\n\nRemember when Clinton said \"women suffer most in war\"? I do. Notice how in Ukraine women and children were allowed to leave and men had to stay? Funny how equality went out the window, huh?\n\nLook, I know this isn't the one issue that broke the Democrats back. But it's a symptom of a much larger problem in that party. And until it's addressed - we're going to keep having whatever this election was.\n\nAnd Democrats have a choice: They can mature and grow from this as a learning experience. Or stomp their feet, throw tantrums, blame everyone but themselves, and then see if that somehow allows them to win next time.\n\nBut part of that maturing is asking yourselves: \"Why did the people with the most to gain from us not vote for us?\" before you start asking white men wtf - because that's a pretty big question with a very uncomfortable answer.\n\nBut you want to know my real gripe about society right now? My **REAL** problem? It's that if I'm critical of *anything* - people think I clearly must hate it. If I'm critical of Apple then clearly I just hate Apple - even though I have an iPhone. If I'm critical of World of Warcraft then clearly I hate it and should just quit. If I'm critical of the Democrats then clearly I'm just a DINO, at best, and a Republican at worst - and clearly I'm a racist and sexist and should \"just shut up and vote Trump\" (actually had a Redditor tell me this).\n\nAmericans, as a whole, simply cannot handle dialog. And it shows. And it makes me irrationally angry that we, as a country, cannot talk about things we're uncomfortable with. And yet we act like we're civilized.\n\nNote: I actually voted blue this time. I didn't select the Republicans that were running unopposed - I just skipped them entirely. I'm in an area in Texas where I'm the 5%.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm not being condescending, no need to be a victim.\n\nNumbers of millionaires is listed a ton of different ways and there's actually no valid metric because you cannot calculate people's net worth. The government has no idea how much money I have, and certainly doesn't know that I'm a white male straight millionaire, polls are just guessing whether or not I am. I'd wager those guesses would be wrong for me, and most others. Hence in part why election polls are so dramatically off. Shocker, Republicans, the wealthy, and 'demonized' classes such as the \"white male\" don't like to galavant around about it.\n\nMany metrics I see state 25 millionish households are millionaire net worths. This may or may not include spouses, but in general would, pushing it toward 50 million. I have a strong suspicion this is heavily underestimated. Anyone who owns a house and even minimally invests money in retirement will have well over a million dollar net worth by retirement. https://www.empower.com/the-currency/money/average-retirement-savings-by-age#:~:text=Key%20takeaways%3A&text=Americans%20in%20their%2060s%20have,of%20almost%20%24815%2C000%20for%20retirement. Average here being around $1.2MM by age 60 not including their house, cars, etc. The average American is incredibly wealthy. And we have a much higher income than most any other country in the world. And we're taxed marginally less than most of those other countries.\n\nLegal immigrants vote vehemently against illegal immigration. You can see that in the numbers. Legal immigrants are typically working class Americans who hurt the most by cheap illegal labor. They will benefit by not allowing innumerable illegals into the country and stay in the country. They will have to go through due process.\n\nYou are free to marry, fuck, and fondle pretty much whatever you want in this country as long as it consents at this point. I think LGBTQ+ are doing just fine on human rights.\n\nWomen have a lot more rights than to kill a child during a pregnancy. Women already do have equal rights in this country. Constant victimhood of everyone and wanting special treatment is also poison. Abortion is a difficult topic because you're pitting a fetus against a mother. It's so weird that Dems have made this a right to choose for women argument when the only hot button issue is abortion. If it was so important, Dems should have codified it during Obama. They didn't. That's on the Dems. Republicans want it left to the states. If you ignore the fringe cases which are used for talking points rather than practicality, leaving it to the states affects very few people and becomes a fringe topic. One which will continue to be abused by Democrats for elections to come.\n\nTrump isn't Satan. He's a shit person but he's not entirely unreasonable. Certainly not as bad as Reddit claims he is. And we've already had him as president once. The world didn't end. If he had lost this election he'd have run again in 2028 and we'd have him then instead. It's more like ripping the bandaid off at this point. He's a popular candidate and the Democrats have done nothing of substance in four years. They appointed a candidate instead of electing one, and they put an uninspiring candidate against a popular one. Dug their own grave, so to speak.", "label": 1}
